This was what informed the initial stance on masks. But what I think they failed to recognise was that (a) asymptomatic spread was possible and quite common - meaning that you may be able to spread the virus even when you don't show any clear symptoms; and (b) infected people with mild symptoms might not heed the warning to use face masks. A caveat to (a) here is that whether or not masks can prevent asymptomatic spread still hasn't been established. However, I think there's an extremely high likelihood of this being the case, and it's really really better to be safe than sorry.\n\nAlso the main reason why this was enacted only just now, was because the government had just finished giving out its masks - so they can justify policy like this.", "DuePomegranate": "That's a ridiculously small study.

Just to refresh your memory: \n\n> How do you know that they don\u2019t have evidence?\n> Ho Ching posted 9 weeks ago on ST Engineering shifting production to Singapore due to Taiwan ban (which we still have to source for raw materials btw), and Chan Chu Seng\u2019s leak recording on the government taking a gamble with the mask situation in Feb and the YouTube video of the Taiwanese chief Covid-19 official confirming that they disrupted our ability to provide masks.

The government maintains a stable stockpile. Whatever is drawn down, has to be put back and the shortfall will take at least two months to refill.\n\nThe points you raise here are valid but again they don't support SG Matter's conclusion that if not for the Taiwan Export ban we'd have \"more than enough masks\". With the ban, we drew down on the stockpile and we now have to replenish that. If the ban did not happen, we would still need to maintain the same stockpile. I really just come back to the point that having 1 million extra masks at this point (heck even if we doubled the amount to 2 million), we won't have more than enough masks, and we won't have left over to give away. \n\n**Again, even with super generous estimations of 2 million masks being the opportunity cost, SG Matter's statement is false.

The dude above stated many times he doesn't believe either parties should be subjected to POFMA but if you stood by the opinion that TOC should be POFMA-ed then SGMatters should as well for similar reasons.

Are you a part of the SG Matters page and privy to certain data unlike the general public? If you are not then your claims that they have any such evidence is horseshit.\n\nLooking at your \"data-driven\" argument here. You assume the capacity is more than 1m a month since it wasn't running on full capacity. So at what % capacity was it operating at? You wouldn't know and you're just making estimation here on your part but sure I'll give it to you for the sake of your argument.\n\nOnce again you assume only 30-40% of our healthcare workers would require n95 masks. Is there any evidence to support your estimation of 30-40%? Yep I thought so too.\n\nLastly, the poster specifically found fault with SG Matters' claim that we would have excess masks to export to other countries if Taiwan didn't hinder our production. I am sure with your great interest in the subject matter that you know there is a global supply chain holdup relating to the key material needed to produce the N95 masks. Are you/SG Matters privy to any information that suggests Singapore has contracts in place with any suppliers of the key material (therefore making sure we have a healthy supply of the material to produce \"upwards of 1m masks monthly\"? Didn't think so too\n\nAre you aware of our current supply of the key material needed to produce the N95 masks and therefore our current ability to produce the N95 masks (with full capacity)? Didn't think so once again.\n\nSo how can SG Matters (and you) be sure that we would have excess to export to others if not for the TW situation? Err... You can't.
