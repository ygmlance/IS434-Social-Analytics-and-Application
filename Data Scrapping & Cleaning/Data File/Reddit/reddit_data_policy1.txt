Sure, some would argue that these measures should've been better enforced instead of it just being \"voluntary\", but had those measures been adhered to diligently, I'd think that we wouldn't need to get to this point. \n\nYou're also assuming that such problems of non-compliance wouldn't have occurred if we had raised the dorscon and had implemented a lockdown from the beginning. I can't bear to imagine the throngs of people rushing to NTUC/IKEA/Toys r us/etc. just before the lockdown, and the sheer number of people losing their jobs/income unnecessarily because companies wouldn't have had the time to figure out appropriate action plans. Blaming the government for not locking down the country earlier also insinuates that most if not all residents are too stupid and dumb to proactively carry these measures out on their own.\n\nAnd before you attack me for being some pro-govt PAP dog, I can also be critical of the govt if their actions warrant criticisms. For example, the current situation at the dormitories was absolutely avoidable. Like whose idea was it to house hundreds of thousands of workers in confined spaces without thinking that if just one person has the virus, it's game over for the place. And why is it that this issue never crossed the minds of anybody in the taskforce before it had to come to this?\n\nSo you see, there are many other aspects of the govt's response to the virus that one can be critical of, but blaming the govt for residents' non-compliance of the measures is just a bit too far-fetched to me.", "AidilAfham42": "The rule simply stated to stay home unless your life depends on it.", "usherer": "And it's not as if Singapore doesn't have one of the worst income divides in the world.

And I will never forgive myself if I did,\" he wrote in the post.\n\n> \"The remaining 21 days are a critical window that will determine if we can successfully flatten the curve, prevent large-scale community spread, and save our loved ones.\"\n\n> Meanwhile, a Straits Times check at Velocity in Novena around noon on Monday found that while there was still a lunchtime crowd visiting the mall to take away food from eateries, human traffic was considerably diminished.\n\n> At West Coast Park, individuals and small family groups of parents and children were seen strolling, jogging or exercising at about 6pm. No one was seen loitering around the rest areas, except for one elderly man, who was sipping a drink on a bench.\n\n> Dr Leong Chee Chiew, commissioner of parks and recreation at the National Parks Board, said most parks and gardens managed by the Board saw low to moderate visitorship levels.\n\n> But different parts of Singapore's green spaces had to be progressively closed to allow for safe distancing and prevent groups from gathering, especially during peak periods.\n\n> Those visiting these areas to walk, jog and cycle by themselves or with individuals from the same household should practice safe distancing measures and return to their homes once done, he said.\n\n> \n\n> At West Coast Park, individuals and small family groups of parents and children were seen strolling, jogging or exercising at about 6pm.

Egregious cases will be prosecuted in court, he added.\n\n> \n\n> Foreign residents caught breaching these rules might have their work passes or permanent resident status revoked.\n\n> Mr Wong, who co-chairs the the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, noted that the Government had updated its advisory on masks based on the \"latest medical and scientific advice\u201d and that the exercise to distribute reusable masks to Singaporeans was completed over the weekend.\n\n> \n\n> \u201cNow that we have distributed the mask to everyone and generally people have started to adjust to the new requirements or the advisory, we are making it mandatory for all,\u201d said Mr Wong.;\n\n> \n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> \u201cThe minute you leave your room, or you leave your house, you have to wear a mask when you go out.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> Children below the age of two will not need to wear a mask based on medical experts\u2019 recommendations on child safety, he said.\n\n> \n\n> As for adults, only those who are engaging in strenuous exercises like running and jogging do not have to wear a mask, but they will have to put it on once they stop exercising.\n\n> \n\n> Mr Wong also reiterated the need for them to maintain a safe distance from others when they are exercising.\n\n> \n\n> \u201cWe are very happy that many Singaporeans and residents are cooperating and doing their part, and complying with these measures,\u201d said Mr Wong, noting that movement across the island has reduced significantly.\n\n> \n\n> With safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers \u201chard at work on the ground\u201d, hotspots like wet markets, hawker centres and parks \u201care generally now under control\u201d, he said.\n\n> \n\n> \u201cMost people are doing the right thing.

These are still early days and we have at least another three more weeks to go. So we have to double down on our efforts and just stay at home.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> About 20 per cent of the workforce comprises essential workers and continue to travel to their workplaces, Mr Wong noted.

Of course with more cases means researchers have new and more data to work with which results in a different advice. That does not mean the initial mask advice is wrong, it is just no longer valid with new scientific evidence. (It's part of science if you didn't know).

Which is why healthcare workers wear full PPE. \n\nInitially: Mask up if you are sick because if you have symptoms, you may have the virus since asymptomatic transmission was unlikely based on evidence *at that time*.\n\nNow: Mask up all the time because you may unknowingly carry and transmit the virus because asymptomatic transmission is highly likely based on evidence *at this time*. \n\n>\tyeah so like \"aiya, no asymptomatic study to prove then nvm la, let them cough in the air/hand and touch here and there\" right.. use common sense la bodoh.\n\nI feel lucky that you're probably no where in the public service.

The one-off S$600 payout from the Government, disbursed as part of the Solidarity Budget on Tuesday (Apr 14), will also tide her over the difficult time.\n\n> \n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> \u201cWhen I received news that there would a payout, I felt quite grateful because I\u2019m in the arts industry, in the film industry - we are quite badly affected,\" she told CNA. \"I was very grateful ... It would definitely sustain me for a bit.\"\n\n> \n\n> However, Ms Sim believes there are some out there that require more help, such as Singapore's migrant workers, and hopes to contribute a portion of her payout towards this cause.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> \"The need is stronger for someone else. The amount is significant to me, but it is even more significant to (others),\" Ms Sim explained. \"I hope it wouldn\u2019t seem like I\u2019m making a big sacrifice or contribution. I personally think it\u2019s only a small thing I can do to perhaps alleviate a much bigger issue.\"\n\n> \n\n> The S$600 payout was announced as part of the Solidarity Budget, which aims to help firms, workers and households amid a worsening pandemic that has affected many sectors in Singapore.\n\n> Nine in 10 Singaporeans will receive it, said the Ministry of Finance.\n\n> \n\n> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat had urged those who can to donate the payouts to charities on the Giving.sg website or the Community Chest\u2019s Courage Fund, or to directly share it with others.\n\n> \u201cNot everyone will need these cash payouts. I am very encouraged that many have written to me, my ministerial colleagues and MPs, that they do not need the cash payouts, and suggest that we give these to those who need the cash more. I thank fellow Singaporeans for your thoughtfulness,\u201d said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister.\n\n> \n\n> \"IT'S ABOUT FULFILLING BASIC HUMAN NEEDS\"\n\n> Ms Sim is not alone in her desire to help others using her payout.\n\n> \n\n> A Give.asia fundraiser titled \"Give Your Solidarity Payment to Break Cycles of Inequality #wegiveinsolidarity\" has seen more than S$67,000 raised from about 450 contributors as of 11.30am on Wednesday.\n\n> \n\n> The fundraiser hopes to benefit five organisations and help them to support vulnerable groups. These organisations include charities such as Boys' Town, Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME), Red Cross, women's rights group Aware, as well as Hagar, an organisation that helps women and children.\n\n> Account manager Nicholas Lee donated S$300 of his payout to a Red Cross campaign to help the elderly on the same morning the money was credited to his bank account.\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m lucky that my job is stable enough in this period \u2026 When I received notice of this sum, I wanted to donate it all away, but I wanted to find the right cause,\u201d said the 27-year-old.\n\n> Mr Lee hopes to use the remaining S$300 to help other causes close to his heart, such as children in low-income families.\n\n> \n\n> \"What made me want to help out the elderly and kids (who are in need) is because their basic needs cannot be fulfilled,\" he said. \"For the elderly, it's having enough food to eat. For kids, it's being able to attend lessons, having trouble doing home-based learning. That's why I felt very affected - these (are the) very basic needs that we take for granted, that they can\u2019t actually have.\"\n\n> Civil servant Esna Ong is hoping to reach two groups with her payout - migrant workers as well as children in need of laptops for home-based learning, which has been imposed on all schools throughout the circuit breaker period.\n\n> \n\n> \u201cIn this time if you have extra and you have a stable job, I think it\u2019s all the more important to give to others. My parents always encouraged us to give,\" said Ms Ong, who wants to donate her full payout.\n\n> \n\n> Ms Ong has already given S$300 to the COVID-19 Migrant Support Coalition, an informal group consisting of volunteers that want to help migrant workers. One of its goals is to curate learning resources to help the workers in equipping themselves with new knowledge and skills.\n\n> \"Sometimes its not just enough to give money without really thinking what you\u2019re giving to,\" she said. \"It\u2019s about having that multiplier effect and choosing a place where that multiplier effect can be stronger.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> Ms Stephanie Siow, who works in corporate communications, noted that these donations could help others for whom the payouts were insufficient.\n\n> \"This is an unprecedented crisis and a lot of these less privileged groups need a lot more help than what the Government can give, because the Government needs to take care of everyone,\" said Ms Siow who has donated her full payout to HOME and Hagar. \"Those more privileged should give a little bit more if they can.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Generally speaking, for some lower-income Singaporeans or PRs (permanent residents) ... the payout might not be enough for them,\" she added. \"For those who are comfortable, if we all can give a little bit, then we might help them a little bit more.\"\n\n> \n\n> Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n> \n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "sharyfairy": "The ill effects of the pandemic are not distributed equally.

Instead we need to rely on various sources like Ministers' FB postings, reddit posts, CNA and ST, etc which I agree is kind of disorganised and scattered. \n\n Perhaps we can check back tomorrow or Monday to see if gov.sg is retroactively updated with today's snowstorm of announcements.

Of course that's also my personal opinion but I'm here to just discuss how we can at least be more detail-oriented in outlook.\n\n\nRecently there's been a massive spike in cases, but if we look deeper, the majority of the hundreds of new cases are really just the  dorm workers. This skews the data tremendously if we're only concerned about local transmissions outside the existing clusters (which going by numbers tally... are well, basically made up mostly of the dorms anyway).\n\n**Say for eg.**\n\n**400 new cases, out of which 399 cases are quarantined already**\n\nvs\n\n**400 new cases, out of which only 100 cases are quarantined.**\n\nThe number is the same, but how we should treat the number should NOT be the same.\n\nIt's like how people panicked when we used to get a record 70+ cases...even though most were imported. True, the imported cases can still spread into locally-transmitted cases but at  present, we dont know the likelihood of that.\n\nThere's also the factor of testing. How many people are actually being tested matters (just look at Iran and their fake numbers). If we didn't test all the dorm workers, the daily numbers we see would probably be much, much lower... and regardless, these workers being quarantined should raise no difference in whether their infections are added to the daily count or not I believe. Because the spread should already be contained to begin with...\n\nLastly, there are those who have already been quarantined and just tested after that...in which case, them adding to the infection count shouldn't matter as much either.\n\nThe ones we should be concerned about are the community transmissions...which are honestly, still significantly small in numbers. If we take away those from existing clusters, the number is even smaller (If im not wrong, only in a few or several dozens per day).\n\nAgain, I'm not saying we're being over-paranoid, but it's important to look at the composition of a big number than just take it as face-value. In that case, we can gauge the severity of the spread more accurately. If we ever see a day of 1000 new cases or something, before you go bonkers...look deeper at the numbers.\n\n----------------\n\n*EDIT: I guess downvotes are downvotes...*\n\n*Seems like readers are getting the wrong message here. I'm not advocating to lessening our lockdown measures or anything. All I'm pointing out is the possibility for daily cases to drop drastically in the future. NOT mainly because of CB measures...but drop naturally...because most cases that we see at the moment are all only from pre-existing clusters and dormitories that are already quarantined and far far away from the general public. Once the dorm infections are over, the total no. of cases will likely drop.\nSo basically...don't go bananas when you see today's 300 new cases*", "comms_num": 26, "comments": {"saperis": "I feel the assessment is being too optimistic here.

This means that those living at the other 18 clusters, as well as at the other foreign worker accommodation (MOM lists 43 licensed dorm operators of 1,000 beds each, & they've also inspected more than 600 other factory-converted dorms in the last few days), aren't subject to quarantine orders unless they are identified as close contacts.\n\nThe 24 workers getting deported for breaking CB measures at Tuas View Square Dorm (meaning they were caught mingling outside nearby) highlight the social dilemma when the entire construction sector is halted.\n\nAt the same time, I expect more dorms to be gazetted as isolation areas in the coming week.

The details are recounted by him and may be biased to his experience, but it does not discount the veracity of whatever happened.\n\nAlso note: This is in no way targetted at the regular employees working at the restaurant, who were undoubtedly overworked as well. Rather, someone in the higher management has to take some responsibility and provide compensation to the drivers/riders and customers.\n\nUpdate: My father informed me when I finished writing this that he received a small goodwill amount as compensation from Grab. However, I will still be posting this as I feel that this will provide good insights into the workings of the food delivery industry, and hopefully restaurants and customers will be able to empathise with riders/drivers as demand for food delivery has substantially increased, and not unfairly subject them to long waiting times or blame them for long waiting times respectively.\n\nThe Background:  My Dad who is almost 60 has been driving for Grabfood since last week as his income for PHV is no longer sustainable. This afternoon, he went on his usual lunch shift and got his first 3 stacked orders from Din Tai Fung (NEX) at around 11.30am and went to the restaurant to collect the food. When he arrived, there were already 7-8 delivery riders, who were mumbling and complaining that they had been waiting for more than 20-30 mins and that no orders had been served yet. \n\nThe Problem:  As more and more riders arrived, it quickly became apparent that the restaurant was still very slow in handing out food to the riders/drivers. Worse, it seemed that the restaurant was prioritising orders for customers who were ordering on the spot and this led to more delivery drivers being stacked at the main entrance. Although all of them were wearing mask and observing social distancing, it was still difficult to fit all of them into proper distancing, because at one point there was almost 30 riders waiting at the entrance. (Note, most of the riders had 2-3 stacked orders, meaning that there was possibly 60-90 orders that were unfulfilled at the restaurant.) By now, the restaurant communicated to riders that orders would take upwards of 30 mins but refused to commit to a time frame as there were too many orders coming in, making it hard for riders who had to respond to customers calling to ask when their food would arrive.\n\nFurthermore it was clear that the restaurant was struggling to cope (as the restaurant had an \u201copen\u201d concept, my dad could see the workers inside \nand it was clear that it was less than the usual capacity) My father would later learn that the the outlet had a promo going on and was puzzled as to why they had so little workers even when demand was bound to increase with the promo going on.\n\nFurther problems: By the one hour mark, it was clear to the restaurant and riders that the orders were not going to be resolved anytime soon, with the orders coming out 1 every 3-4 mins, and with over 20 riders still waiting. Many riders became frustrated as this was the lunch time peak hour, and staying at the restaurant only meant they could not take up other jobs, so some decided to cancel.  It was even worse for other riders who had collected other orders but not the ones at Din Tai Fung, so those orders would have turned cold. As my Dad could speak Chinese and had already collected another order, he went to check on the remaining orders and was horrified to learn that those orders had been cancelled, but the delivery status on the app remained (A few minutes ago, they were still saying they were still making, albeit the long waiting times) \n\nIn other words, the restaurant was verbally telling delivery drivers (and only if you went up to ask them) that some of the orders would be cancelled, and that they would call the customers later. My dad told me that some other riders who did not speak Chinese were completely clueless as to what was going on and had to rely on nearby chatters to figure out the problem. They would only announce all the mass cancellations nearly 1.5 hour after the first order, and even then the app still showed the delivery status as pending.\n\nHowever, as the restaurant side had not formally cancelled these orders, the customers were unable to see the cancellation and the burden fell on the delivery man to deliver the bad news, so you can quite imagine the results. My father had to explain to a customer that it was not his fault when it was implied he should not have taken a stacked order in order to maximise earnings and instead deliver just one order, when he had no idea of the situation at Din Tai Fung until he reached the restaurant. If he had knew I doubt he would have taken it as well, since the orders came together. Simply put, there was no way he could have avoided this, and once he was there he could only have cancelled the job (affecting his rating and earnings) or waited it out. And with all these going on, there was already lots of back and forth with the riders and Grab support staff, who only stopped the orders coming in after an hour of waiting time. Mind you, the riders already told Grab to stop the orders more than half an hour ago, where Grab\u2019s response was only to call the restaurant, resulting in more unnecessary back and forth.\n\nConclusion: In the end, my dad could only deliver one order as the other 2 were cancelled. Although he was later compensated for the trip and given a small goodwill amount, he wasted nearly 2.5 hours in this situation, having even to go to Grab HQ (since he could not get through to Grab support staff) to troubleshoot as he could not take new orders with the old ones still pending as the restaurant had not formally cancelled them yet. This meant that he spent his entire lunch shift earning only that amount, where his usual income would be at least twice more if he had taken other jobs (And this is not even accounting for parking or other expenses). In other words, my dad earned barely enough for the 2.5 hours, and I really teared to learn he was just standing around and running around like a mad dog trying to resolve the issue with the restaurant and having to call the customers to smooth it over with them as well. I don\u2019t understand why it is my Dad\u2019s responsibility to inform customers about the cancellation, even if the customers were nice and understanding, there was bound to be some tension and frustration when anyone learns their food is not going to arrive after 1.5 hours.\n\nLearning point : This incident has really made me more appreciative of delivery drivers, and I\u2019m making it a point to tip at least a dollar to all of them in the future (I\u2019m hoping most of you could as well), knowing that they could have very well went through what my father went through. I also appeal to the public to be understanding of delivery riders/drivers, due to the current Covid-19 situation, as many of them are former PHV or taxi drivers who are in their old age with various medical conditions. \n\nIf you are a merchant who has come up with a promo or promo code, please be responsible enough to hire enough workers when you expect the demand to increase, and not just blindly insist on cost cutting measures.\n\nIf you are a customer who is waiting unreasonably long for your food, do check the app to see where the problem lies, and if the food is still at the merchant, please understand that the riders are every bit as frustrated as you are, and perhaps even more than you are. Since their income is dependent on the trips they make, every minute spent waiting for your food means every minute less they could be out there, taking another delivery job, affecting their overall earnings.\n\nAlso, if you are applying promo codes or ordering food on promotion, please also understand that some of the merchants may be unable to cope and that your food may take longer than usual. If you want to save on your cost, it is only expected that the delivery time would be more as there will be more orders coming in. \n\nLet\u2019s all be empathetic enough to each other and be more gracious in these trying times. My dad, who despite going through all this, is still thankful that he has some earnings to cover his rental and petrol, taking home maybe $10-20 nett every day. He doesn\u2019t feel that anyone should be blamed and that he was perhaps just unfortunate to be in this situation. I\u2019m proud of him and all our delivery drivers still working, and we can all certainly be more appreciative towards them, instead of putting them down when your food doesn\u2019t arrive or turns cold even if it is not their fault.", "comms_num": 139, "comments": {"MrDabianz": "I was one of them there at around that time, can confirm it was a shit show.

But would you rather I as the rider tell the customer \"the restaurant has decided to prioritize walk ins over your order so be prepared to wait over an hour for your food\" or would you rather tell the walk in customer \"sorry we're preparing food in the sequence we receive orders and there's lots of delivery orders ahead of yours\" which if you're a sensible wait staff you would've already told the walk-in customer before they started ordering unless you want the customer to be angry at you later.\n\nYes, every single restaurant is jammed during peak hours. Trust me, you can ask any rider and they'll tell you 90% of merchants make you wait during peak hours. And yes, if there's really that many people ordering DTF, I could cancel one DTF order and the next order that jumps out is another DTF order. Once again, ask any rider.\n\nNo, the customer cannot cancel the order once a rider has accepted it. No, the rider also cannot cancel the order for the customer. The only people who can do that is the hotline. And if a shitshow like this is going on, you can be guaranteed the hotline will be slammed. No one's gonna get through without ridiculous wait times. So the order can't get cancelled. I can inform the customer all right, but they can't cancel, I can't cancel, then what? The customer can order the another meal yea sure, but the rider can't cancel, so he can't move on to another job y'know? That's lost income. And self-cancellations affect our eligibility for incentives. And self-cancellations just result in the order being assigned to another rider who'll repeat the cycle. Once again, ask any rider.\n\nWhile there sure aren't any procedural issues stopping us from cancelling the order on our end, would you, as an employee, be willing to take a pay cut because someone else fucked up? I bet not. Same logic here. Restaurant messed up by taking more than they could handle, so why should I as the rider risk losing my incentive because the restaurant messed up? It's not a false dilemma when you're actually put in the situation of deciding whether to cancel and move to the next order to get 20 bucks or lose an incentive worth over 50. Once again, ask any rider.\n\nYou're entitled to your opinion here, but what you've said indicates your obvious lack of awareness and knowledge to what a food delivery rider's job is like. If you don't know what our side of the story is like, don't make assumptions on what we can or cannot do.

We have closed the FP delivery status  before and even shutdown the phone, to our surprise a deliveryrider appeared and on his phone, it showed that the order was accepted. Switch on the phone to confirm and it did appear. Though it was not our fault, felt really bad when we had to tell him about the glitch and that the food item was also sold out already.

Compensation is well and good but $4 for waits upwards of 2hrs? That's pathetic.\n\nJust to put things into perspective but Foodpanda has managed this much better. Whenever a certain store hit a ceiling of orders, Foodpanda automatically flags the shop as closed to stop taking orders. This way, restaurants are not swamped with orders whilst customers still get their food in a reasonable time. **This is the way it should be done.

Riders/Drivers earn a living. Having no **incentives** and waiting more than 30 mins lowers income by -$15 (eg $25-15=$10). \n\n2. **Timing**. Many riders are out early everyday working more than 12hrs. Every hr counts, if Grab and shops dont recognise it soon, they're gng to lose substantial business to competitors in the long run. \n\n3. Drivers/Riders **costs** are either affected by petrol or by hrs cycling to and fro between locations. Even tho they may save energy or petrol, there is no income for idle time. \n\n4. Becos of **COVID-19**, many have chosen Grabfood and are trying to make some income to tide thru smaller bills. Incentives help riders/drivers, with more perks there'll be more people to help with the orders.\n\n5. Lastly, **Restaurants**.

Restaurant has lost a customer. \n\nRight and you\u2019ve already answered your own question. It is very very unlikely that every SINGLE merchant faced by a food delivery guy will be so inefficient - because it will hurt their profits too. So your argument about next merchant being equally slow whatsoever, moot. ~~The problem is OP\u2019s dad did not choose to cancel and move on when OP explicitly mentioned that a number of other riders did - in that case, he made the choice to wait that 2.5hr, the \u201clost opportunity cost\u201d is his to bear. I also don\u2019t think ANY customer would actually want to wait 2.5hr for their lunch, even if it is from DTF. But Idk, don\u2019t see OP addressing this in his post.~~ Edit: OP has clarified that his dad was repeatedly given false assurances that the food would be out soon and all that, so I understand why he did not move on and stand corrected.\n\nSecondly, is it not possible for the rider to just communicate the situation to the customer so that the order doesn\u2019t get recycled to the next rider? So that the customer can make alternative plans? If you, as a grab rider, cancel ur order and don\u2019t bother to communicate the situation to the unknowing customer then I think u r part of the problem. It is highly unlikely that the customer would insist on waiting 2.5hr for their lunch.\n\nThirdly, you\u2019re putting yourself into a false dilemma here. You always have a choice. I note that you mentioned the trade off for moving on to the next customer is \u201cwhat if the next merchant is slow ... will affect our incentives\u201d. Like I said, it is not certain that the next merchant will be slow and secondly, it\u2019s not like there are procedural issues barring u from moving on to the next order. You can, perhaps at the risk of making less in terms of incentives. There\u2019s no either or situation here.

I feel so much this undertone of : they are not from Singapore, they are less than us.

They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure. Some news reports here: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)\n\nThere are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins.

Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.\n\nWe could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd \"fix\" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? \n\nIn the short term, sure, we can \"fine\" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.\n\nFWIW, I've commented on this a few times: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fz0khl/foreign\\_worker\\_megacluster/fn5dm9h?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fz0khl/foreign_worker_megacluster/fn5dm9h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fye6rq/something\\_something\\_wage/fmzvjrx?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fye6rq/something_something_wage/fmzvjrx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)", "skatyboy": "Did we as voters punish the PAP for this back in the 2015 elections?

The hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary. Theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction. We should have been learning from examples like Australia, where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people. This also creates a sense of pride within our community.\n\nGoing back to the main point, if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce, the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs, which is does throughout history, such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred.\n\nThe foreign workers and their contributions have been immense to our nation building.

So there's something like a prisoner's dilemma and the point of failure here is really regulation, not individual firms.\n\nYou could argue that by making dorm operators bear the cost of treatment, they will internalise the costs and risks involved in squeezing so many workers into one space. But the social costs of a pandemic are way higher than the private costs of treatment: you're making them pay for the cost of treating each infected individual but you're not making them pay for the cost of them spreading the virus to others. So in equilibrium you'll still see not enough precautions being taken. And I would argue that with black swan events like a pandemic that happen so infrequently and have so many unknown unknowns, even if you impose a fine for each infected case that truly reflects the social cost of the pandemic, I don't think it is realistic to think that this will induce dorm operators to take the right precautions.", "ChinaWine_official": "Yeah.
