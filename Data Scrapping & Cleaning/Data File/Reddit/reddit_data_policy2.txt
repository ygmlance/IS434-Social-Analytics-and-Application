For example, Brown Sugar Boba Milk Tea contains 92.5g of sugar according to this article I have linked at the bottom. Many of the other drinks are not far behind in terms of sugar content. \n\nA simple google search shows that the American Heart Assosciation's recommended sugar intake for a male is 37.5g of sugar a day for men and 25g of sugar a day for women. Thus, one bubble tea drink has 2.5 times to 3.5 times the daily recommended sugar intake amount. Couple that with sugar intake from other carbohydrates such as rice, and it is a recipe for disaster for your body.\n\nIf you drink bubble tea everyday while sitting on your ass at home all day long like we all have to do now, your blood sugar levels will begin to get worse and worse. Can lead to an early onset of Type 2 Diabeties.

All other F&B outlets that sell meals can continue to remain open for takeaway and delivery services only.\n\n> Hairdressing and barber services will be required to close their outlets.\n\n> The list of activities that will be allowed to continue to operate will be updated at https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/essentialservices.\n\n> Earlier during the press conference, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that the list of essential F&B outlets would be tightened.\n\n> This is intended to help fight the spread of Covid-19.\n\n> Related story:\n\n> Top image from Unsplash\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "557088": "Time to hoard chips and snacks from NTUC...", "GutsyGallant": "So cheap ice cream will be gone, leaving only Haagen Dazs, Bens and Jerry, etc...?\n\nThe news outlet did not mention anything about the manufacturing aspects though.

That the items are reserved before being delivered, however this is not the case for orders which stem from Giant. It is packed the day before you order the item. So for example with something that is scarce in todays hypermarkets- lets say err Tapioca Starch with all the bubble tea shops which have closed yesterday, you place the order on the item(immediately)(coz super high demand) and the delivery date is stipulated to be next week Monday, the way their logistics work is that instead of reserving the items from their warehouse, they would get people to collect the items\\~\\~(FairPrice uses a hybrid of this system and packs before time)\\~\\~ the day before you place the order. from their physical stores. This then goes to their delivery fleet and then gets sent to your home. This means that if the item is not available N+4 days after you placed a valid order(along w the delivery fee) you would be informed the very evening before the delivery the next day that items X/Y/Z are now unavailable. And the best part of this experience is their customer support. After inquiring with them(the customer support team) with regards to this issue, my dude just told me that just shop at places other than Giant if I want quality service and deliveries on time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/rant\n\nSorry for the rant but I think that people should know where they are getting their groceries from in the event that the Supermarkets are very crowded.\n\nNote: Im not blaming our essential workers but the logistics' management excluding the customer service agents(who probably received multiple calls like mine)(and made them even more sian/annoyed) because of the rudeness that one person emanated in the phone call.

Parents tried to make the experience slightly more positive by giving him something to look forward to - bubble tea. Now that give parents a method to help the child cope with the difficult time. Then you remove bubble tea, and parents are back to square one, trying to help the child adjust to the restrictions while dealing with their own challenges as working adults.\n\nWhat is \"non-essential\" to you may be essential to someone else.

The argument being that if the government chooses a full lockdown for the required period, it would be painful but is the quickest way to get things back to normal.\n\nHowever I feel things are not so simple. A full lockdown should be the last resort because of the scale and resources it would require. How will we get food to everyone to make sure they have enough to last for that period? Who will enforce it? Would not the enforcers be putting themselves in danger? If u were sick and need medical treatment how will that work? All this needs to be planned for properly and the citizens need to be informed and follow the rules.\n\nWhat the government is doing is to base the next step on data. Yes numbers are high but they are mostly accounted for by the dorms. Yes on hindsight they can do better. But they are dealing with the problem now and that's better than never. Those numbers will fall.\n\nThe more important numbers are that relating to local transmission cases. It's been about a week from the start of circuit breaker measures and numbers are starting to decline but PM Lee mentioned they are looking at single digit or even 0 cases. Clearly it's not enough and hence they need to tighten the measures. This I understand.\n\nWhat I don't understand is our obsession with the relatively minor things. There are people out there breaking CB rules but instead on focusing on our safety (by wearing masks and practicing social distance), we take videos and condemn them on social media. Bubble tea became an easy target as to what constitutes essential. Are these really why covid is still spreading? Perhaps but we can't say for sure. So we will try close up the gaps, and in the meantime find links in the cases that have come up. The latter is limited by the resources we have. There's no way to aggressively test our community cases, or more accurately not yet while we still have to devote a large part of those resources to the dorms.\n\nTl:Dr - In short it will take time.

I do know that we have no choice because of many other reasons including people repeatedly flaunting the CB rules which partially caused this to extend in the 1st place.\n\nI'm aware of the BBT \"last minute yolo party\" queue last night. While like many of the Singaporeans where I'm tempted to immediately scoff and jump in to criticize them, I thought for a while and decided to take a moment, and think through in regards to their situation, thoughts and feelings at that moment. \n\nWhy do people seem to forgo all logic and common sense for something as trivial as a dumb cup of sugar, tea and boba? Why is it that we can still manage to stay home as much as we can but upon hearing about the non-essential F&B ban, we lose all of our bearings and do ridiculous actions?\n\nA lot of our lives have been disrupted out of the blue, with some of us handling it while others are breaking down entirely. You would see people doing funny stuff like using exercising as an excuse to go out, taking buses and intentionally going to far places, people using buying food as an excuse to go out etc. Does it sound stupid? Yes. But is it sad? Yes. Our lives have just been forcefully disrupted out of the sudden after all.\n\nAlso it's the 1st time that us as a nation, we had to observe such protocols in the longest time ever as a modern nation. Is this a #firstworldproblem ? Absolutely yes. \nBut is it hard? Yes as well.\n\nI'm pretty sure that many of us definitely have 1-2 snacks/comfort food of our liking/choice lying around at home such as loaves of bread, cakes, chips, crisps, soft drinks etc or whichever other sort of foods that you like during this period of CB. Now imagine having none of these for 1 month, and having to coop up at home + some of us facing personal issues or the aftermath of getting retrenched due to Covid-19. Would you be able to truly be alright, if this has been dealt to you on top of all the other stuff that has been handed to you?\n\nIn my humble opinion, food itself holds an important role even if we should be living to eat and not eating to live. Countless times in history have shown that food can make or break a nation/army. Food has been shown to be a mercy, comfort and deliverance for this harsh existence of our lives. Food has been made as our joy and blessing that we can afford to enjoy even in the toughest moments.\n\nThus, having thought all of these points made me feel sad and wanting to empathise with people instead of wanting to laugh/scoff/mock/scold them. It made me feel helpless about this pandemic as our hands are tied, yet we cannot do anything about it other than abiding by these extreme measures to combat this pandemic.

I know there would be a queue, but the length of the queue yest is really absurd. \n\nMost of the people who queued yesterday are still living okay, they have time and less struggle in their current lives, hence they can afford to go down and dont mind spending large amounts of time to queue for bubble tea.

They've been abused to the point of insanity just so people can bring pets to places which are otherwise strictly \"pet free.\" Yeah, everyone needs emotional support; but sometimes we need to temporarily find new avenues to cope.\n\nWe are already aware of the very real existence of hidden hot-spots; so let's imagine that because of a bunch of simpletons ignoring safe distancing and otherwise leaving their house for no good reason other than to selfishly satisfy a craving we now have a new explosion of cases and the the lock-down is extended, who's to blame?\n\nI get that this is a difficult time for everyone, but it only takes a small percentage of the population to ignore the circuit breaker to make it almost impossible to contain the virus; and spending unnecessary time outside queuing for a luxury commodity does not help ***anyone*** if the net result is yet another circuit breaker extension.\n\nPeople need come to terms with the fact that if we don't make sacrifices now, then this journey is going to be a lot longer and harder than most of us can tolerate and that will subsequently start a vicious and never-ending cycle of \"I need to go out\" -> virus spreads more -> lock-down extended -> \"now I really need to go out\" -> etc.\n\nAnd to address bubble tea directly: I absolutely refuse to believe that anyone can possibly have such a serious addiction to this crap that there doesn't exist any suitable interim substitute. If you've got that bad of a sugar craving most supermarkets are still stocked through the roof with snacks and other sugary delicacies.\n\nSo while yes food is important and I do like a good snack every so often myself, I do realize that sacrifices need to be made and having a sole dependency is just ridiculous.", "LordViole": "No excuses.

It\u2019s for your own good.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the source in question. Who was this \u201cex-diplomat\u201d?\n\n\u00b7 Bilahari Kausikan was former Permanent Secretary of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\n\u00b7 He has substantial experience in the foreign policy arena. I assume he might be privy to classified information which is withheld from our public.\n\n\u00b7 He is no longer a civil servant; he is a pensioner. As such, his views do NOT officially reflect those of the Singapore government.\n\n\u00b7 Despite this, his views hold substantial weight and are frequently published in the Straits Times (which, although not under direct govt control, toes the official line and operates under some form of para-state oversight)\n\n\u00b7 He has not been outright repudiated by other foreign policy elites (as was the case with Kishore Mahbubani). From this we may infer that his views resonate somewhat with the establishment, or our foreign policy orthodoxy\n\n\u00b7 There are some things which our government cannot publicly/officially state, out of prudence\u2026by which I mean, complicating our relationships with certain powers\n\n\u00b7 It is possible that the government prefers to use \u201cunofficial\u201d means (such as retired civil servants) to clarify or rebut certain narratives\n\nNow let\u2019s examine the substance of his argument.\n\nThat China exercises influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore, is not surprising. What should be disturbing is the MEANS or the CHANNELS through which it deploys its influence. There are LEGITIMATE channels for interstate intercourse. These include diplomacy, state media, international aid etc. etc. It is entirely natural (whether it is fair or acceptable is a different debate) for Great Powers to leverage their superior political/economic/military resources to make smaller states comply with their wishes, whether through persuasion or coercion.\n\nBut Bilahari Kausikan\u2019s concern is with the ILLEGITIMATE channels: covert influence operations. These are violations of Singapore\u2019s sovereignty, albeit under the cover of plausible deniability. Influence operations fall under the purview of covert action, which is different from espionage - and far more insidious. Espionage seeks simply to steal information. Covert action is intended to **influence** events (for example, domestic politics or foreign policy) within a target nation-state to one\u2019s own benefit\n\nNow let me be clear: **All Great Powers conduct influence operations and espionage**. China is no exception. Neither is the US. And Singapore is not exempted from their attempts. Our response has been very even-handed.[Examples of foreign interference in the course of history and in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/examples-of-foreign-interference-in-the-course-of-history-and-in-singapore)[An American diplomat once tried to influence the 1988 Singapore General Election](https://mothership.sg/2017/10/an-american-diplomat-once-tried-to-influence-the-1988-singapore-general-election/)[Singapore Protests U.S. 'Interference' After Diplomat Withdrawn](https://apnews.com/cc6ee41575dcc68a0403efb363e0a8a4)[Russia spy claims: US nabs Singapore centre research fellow](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/russia-spy-claims-us-nabs-spore-centre-research-fellow)\n\nBut this is not a valid excuse.

In this sense, China is no different.\u201d* This is equivalent to arguing that wife-beating is acceptable, because many husbands beat their wives! The issue here is not that China or the US wants our support. The issue is the means by which they seek to procure our support.\n\nAmerican influence operations seek to impose a liberal-democratic ideology on Singapore. They are mostly ineffective because American notions of liberalism do not find much resonance among our public political consciousness. Nonetheless, these operations should be exterminated/neutralized whenever and wherever they are detected.\n\nBut **Chinese influence operations are more dangerous and insidious** because they **seek to impose a CHINESE identity on multiracial Singapore.** This is something much harder for our population to resist, particularly because **our national identity is so young and malleable.

The information was duly conveyed by that senior member of the LKYSPP to very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore's foreign policy\u201d.*\n\nAbout 3 months later, LKYSPP Dean Kishore Mahbubani, who previously was a senior MFA diplomat (and presumably has contact with \u201cvery senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore\u2019s foreign policy\u201d), stepped down from his position. If you go on Youtube and watch the speeches and interviews he has been giving, he has become something of a hype-man advertising China\u2019s rise.\n\nI think we can put two and two together.\n\nI do deeply respect Kishore Mahbubani.

I definitely agree with many of his ideas about the rise of Asia and China. In fact, I will be buying his new book \u201cHas China Won?\u201d. But I also think some of his ideas regarding China lack nuance. Reality is often complex.\n\nWhen Lin Xieyi speculated that Huang Jing was a US agent, this was Kausikan\u2019s comment: *\u201cThis is the sort of stuff we must expect, intended to confuse the issue. Some of it will come from the seemingly neutral or well-meaning or the naive or from those whom Lenin used to call 'useful idiots'\u201d*[Ambassador-at-large, Bilahari Kausikan, scoffs at Quora user questioning who Huang Jing is working for](https://mothership.sg/2017/08/ambassador-at-large-bilahari-kausikan-scoffs-at-quora-user-questioning-who-huang-jing-is-working-for/)\n\nKausikan shared more details on the Chinese influence campaign in this lecture, which I encourage all of you to watch:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw)\n\nIf you don\u2019t have time, I\u2019ll summarize (tl;dr skip to the bolded italics):\n\n*When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position on an issue of undoubted importance to us and to the region (South China Sea), the Chinese activated their influence apparatus and went into high gear to pressure the government - our government - to change position\u2026*\n\n*Not all influence operations pose the same degree of risk. The uniqueness of Beijing\u2019s influence operations stems from China\u2019s triple identities. And this prescribes three tracks on which China conducts its foreign policy and influence operations.*\n\n*First, the PRC is a state like any other state, operating within a still largely Westphalian international order\u2026 On this first track of state-to-state relations, there\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about what Beijing does, except the unusually assertive assertive behaviour of some Chinese diplomats of late, in countries as far-ranging as Malaysia, the PNG and Sweden.*\n\n*Secondly, the PRC is not just any state, it\u2019s also a Leninist state\u2026and the characteristic modus operandi of a Leninist state is the United Front, which Mao Zedong called the CCP\u2019s \u201cmagic weapon\u201d\u2026 the main characteristic of a Leninist state is the total subordination of state and society to the interests of the Party, irrespective whether the Party\u2019s interest is internal or external. And as such, the United Front represents a blurring of the distinction between domestic and foreign policies and a significant modification of the principle of non-interference that goes far beyond what is generally considered acceptable diplomatic practice.*\n\n*Thirdly, the PRC is also a civilizational state: the embodiment and exemplar of millennia of the Chinese nation\u2019s history and culture, now rejuvenated\u2026and this identity as a civilizational state finds expression in the work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office\u2026 In plain language, overseas Chinese should identify their interests with China\u2019s interests and work to advance China\u2019s interests. And this represents a deliberate blurring of the distinction made between the \u534e\u4eba (ethnic Chinese) and the \u534e\u4fa8 (overseas PRC citizens)\u2026*\n\n*Now these 3 identities prescribe 3 tracks on which China conducts relationships. And taken holistically, they create a sophisticated and flexible instrument of influence that is far more effective than the conventional operations conducted by other countries. China\u2019s influence operations are effective because the 3 tracks on which it operates makes it difficult to deal with or even grasp - even understand - in entirety.*\n\n*On the first track of state-to-state relations, the usual tactics of persuasion, inducement or coercion may be deployed as appropriate, whether overtly through diplomacy or covertly through intelligence organizations. But the United Front may simultaneously operate to, for example, emphasize coercion or inducement even as the first track stresses persuasion. And the third civilizational track may conveniently wrap everything up in appeals to ethnic pride\u2026Now the tendency of all governments and in particular foreign ministries is to focus on the first track of state-to-state relations and to want to keep them on an even keel\u2026But this can all to easily lead to Chinese activities on the other two tracks being overlooked or downplayed.*\n\n*\\[the narrative of China\u2019s absolute rise and America\u2019s inevitable decline\\] and others were* ***propagated by various means: WeChat with Chinese-speaking populations, social and mainstream media, whispering campaigns, business, clan and cultural associations, as well as conventional agents of influence reporting to Chinese intelligence organizations*** *who cultivate what Lenin called \u201cuseful idiots\u201d.*\n\n***It was difficult to pin down the precise origin of such narratives, but the messaging was to consistent, and too insistent, to be coincidental\u2026many Singaporeans did not realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them whole or played along for other reasons. Businessmen, academics, and others with interests in China were given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless Singapore was more accommodating and passed the messages to the government\u2026Appeals to ethnic pride were made to others. The aim was to instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and get Singaporeans to pressure the government to align Singapore\u2019s interests with China\u2019s interest.***\n\n***In any case and for whatever reason, the 2016\u20132017 Chinese influence operation was effective. The pressures on the government were great.*** *It was very difficult to explain the somewhat abstract importance of UNCLOS or the nuances of our position on the South China Sea or the complications of our relationship with China to the general public, to whom the Chinese narratives were more easily understood. And* ***it cannot be denied that ethnic appeals resonated strongly with a probably not insignificant section of our public.***\n\n***It\u2019s clear enough for whom Huang Jing worked. I told you he had dual US-PRC citizenship. In case you don\u2019t know, holding dual citizenship is forbidden in China. Huang Jing today holds a senior academic position in China, apparently without sanction for holding American citizenship.***\n\n*As the only majority ethnic Chinese sovereign state in the region, Singapore is a special case. A majority Chinese Singapore that nevertheless conducts an independent foreign policy may be something of an anomaly in Chinese eyes.*\n\nThis is not the ravings of some conspiracy theorist. This is our former Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs speaking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**STRATEGIC NARRATIVES**\n\nWhat is a strategic narrative? A weaponized story.\n\nIn its influence campaigns against Singapore, the PRC advances a number of strategic narratives, all of which are, at best, questionable in their truthfulness. Sadly, some of our Singaporean Chinese compatriots sometimes buy into these narratives and even confidently echo them. Now, most of our population is only cursorily interested in foreign affairs and may find such superficial narratives plausible. This must change if they are to be immunized against these narratives.\n\nThis is a war of narratives. China cannot officially pressure us to choose sides. But they can paint a certain picture through unofficial channels and try to box us into a corner. They can try to tell us \u201cSee, this is what you are doing! Stop it!\u201d. When they do that, we MUST push back by painting our own narratives and showing them that \u201cno, actually we\u2019re not doing that. We\u2019re doing THIS\u201d.\n\n**MYTH 1. Surely as a \u201cChinese country\u201d, Singapore should \u201cexplain\u201d China\u2019s position (on the South China Sea and other issues) to the rest of Southeast Asia**\n\n**MYTH 2. China is rising and US is declining; therefore we should bandwagon with China. You should get on the right side of history!**\n\n**MYTH 3. If you are not with China, then you are against China! You are an American puppet/proxy, or, if you are ethnic Chinese, even worse - a race traitor!**\n\n**MYTH 4. Singapore has no claims in the South China Sea, and purports to be a neutral/non-aligned country so why is it \u201ctaking sides\u201d with the US against China by agreeing with the PCA ruling and hosting US naval assets?**\n\n**MYTH 5. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew, the current PAP leadership under Lee Hsien Loong doesn\u2019t know how to deal with China. Relations were sooooo much better under LKY.**\n\nLet me proceed to puncture each of these myths in turn, with great pleasure.\n\n**MYTH 1:** We are NOT a \u201cChinese country\u201d. We are a country that happens to have a majority ethnic-Chinese population that organizes itself on the basis of multiracialism/multiculturalism. This has been fundamental to Singapore\u2019s identity since the days of Lee Kuan Yew, and this is something we must always remember, no matter how many times we are accused of being \u201crace traitors\u201d by our mainland friends. When the PRC tries to impose a \u201cChinese\u201d identity on multiracial Singapore, we MUST resist.\n\nYes, we share ties with mainland Chinese on the basis of blood and culture. This ethnocultural kinship should be celebrated, not denied (as in the case of some HKers). Our similar cultural programming allows us to understand the Chinese mindset in some respects, to \u201cempathize\u201d with it.\n\nBut it does not mean we should unreservedly parrot China\u2019s claims to the rest of Southeast Asia. As country coordinator for ASEAN-China relations, our job is to uphold ASEAN centrality; to represent the interests of ASEAN, of our REGION, in dealing with China. It is not to represent China\u2019s interests in dealings with ASEAN. We have no obligation, moral or otherwise, to advocate or support China\u2019s interests. Understanding them is one matter. Supporting them is another. The two are not mutually irreconcilable, but they must be distinguished.\n\n**MYTH 2:** This myth, like many other myths, has a grain of truth to it. It is very ably represented by the speeches and works of Professor Kishore Mahbubani, our former ambassador and an intellectual whom I admire very much. Unfortunately, it is also extremely oversimplified and ignores many problematic nuances.Indeed, China is rising and has been for quite a while. You would have to be blind to deny that. But China\u2019s rise is not going to be linear; it is going to be a long, winding, and fluctuating road. China has many internal structural problems of its own to deal with. From the way some people talk about China in juxtaposition to the West, it makes it sound like the Chinese are strategic masterminds while the Westerners are a bunch of bumbling idiots. Like I said, grain of truth, but grossly oversimplistic. It ignores many of the US\u2019 intrinsic strengths and some of China\u2019s structural challenges.\n\nChina is rising, but America is NOT in decline, except in relative terms. Militarily it is still pre-eminent in the Asia-Pacific. Its military dominance is receding and will continue to recede in time, as the PLA Navy becomes stronger. China is becoming more and more economically central to our region and the world; depending on which index of measurement you use (GDP PPP, GDP per capita, absolute GDP) it may have already eclipsed the US economy. China is pushing the frontiers of cutting-edge technology like 5G. This process is inevitable.\n\nBut what is not inevitable is the outcome of China displacing the US as regional or global superpower. This is an outcome that is FAR from certain. It is still too early to tell. The only thing we can say for now is that the regional strategic equation will become more and more symmetrical over time. As with buying new stocks/shares on the financial market, it is too early to count our chickens before they are hatched. Some views on China\u2019s rise (Mahbubani\u2019s included) tend to take the Whig view of history - \u201cup and up and on and on\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y73carvadru41.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=61264b61a8fd34703f6ea45615f7f5d68400a5ad\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4ah3bacdru41.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f8887bee600d33e149df5e58cf8b14b2adabd75\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cvf4iz5cru41.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f72928e74331e9d18ee5e1a66feff38fabe23d0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gw5o0pyddru41.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=63229477764d3ca02e2ef6d5186041219dbf539a\n\nThe Chinese never tire of reminding us that China\u2019s presence in Asia is a permanent geographic fact, while America\u2019s presence is the product of a political calculation. This implies both enhanced threat and opportunity for the rest of East Asia (be nice to us, because you have to live with us for the rest of eternity). And that is true - what is our Plan B if America withdraws from the region? Without America, the balance of power in Asia cannot be maintained. But again, this myth is too simplistic. America\u2019s presence in Asia is not as fragile as the Chinese would like us to think.\n\nAsia is burgeoning with growth. In the next few decades the economic center of gravity is going to shift toward the Asia-Pacific. America has an interest in retaining access to this region, in economic and military terms. I do agree that China cannot be contained - it is so interdependent with America that America might as well try to contain itself as to contain China. But we should not underestimate the degree to which America has integrated and committed itself to the Asia-Pacific.\n\n**MYTH 3:** This one I find the most ludicrous and at the same time the most hilarious. Just because I disagree with China\u2019s stance on a SPECIFIC, SINGLE issue means that I must have been brainwashed by western media into being an anti-China dog? Hahahaha.\n\nThis is what is known as a false dichotomy. It is powerful because these dichotomies do exist, but they are a spectrum rather than a binary choice of A or B. China posits an illusory binary between itself and the West, and forces you to choose between them. If you are not A, then you must be B and ONLY B and nothing else. Substitute A and B with pro-China and pro-US, pro-CCP and pro-democracy, blah blah blah. You get the idea. This ignores all the nuances in between.\n\nThis myth is also the most insidious and dangerous one because it denies the existence of AGENCY on the part of small states. It denies that small states can ever act autonomously -that anything that we do must be driven by the hidden hand of Great Power competition.\n\nSingapore\u2019s policy can be characterized as strategic hedging. I will admit we lean slightly toward low-intensity \u201csoft\u201d balancing against China, but it is still more nuanced than \u201chard\u201d balancing against China and \u201chard\u201d bandwagoning with the US.\n\nBy the way, Singapore is not the only country practicing a hedging strategy. Duterte has recently taken to flirting with China; I don\u2019t blame him, I think it\u2019s a smart move. But he has also increased cooperation with Japan, and he has not abolished the alliance Treaty which formally commits the US to defend the Philippines in wartime. Thailand has grown closer toward China as well, buying Chinese tanks, but it is still a US ally. Even Myanmar: when Myanmar realized in the 2000s and early 2010s that it was growing more and more dependent on Chinese investment, infrastructure etc., what did it do? It initiated a rapprochement with the Obama Administration. Malaysia under Mahathir began to reassess a number of Chinese infrastructure projects in light of its indebtedness to China. The American 7th Fleet still calls at Malaysian ports. Vietnam is probably leaning even further toward the Balancing end of the spectrum than Singapore - the very existence of Vietnam as an independent entity is predicated on thousands of years of resisting subordination to China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3304oopdru41.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=781ec3355962a02b7808429eb1396e020f742f15\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgjxjz0rdru41.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa9190919b355a8c6155d8f56b2f6456332f617\n\nSo, fellow Singaporeans, do not believe that we are alone in playing this delicate game of power-balancing. That is what China wants you to believe: that we are acting alone and inadvertently as a US proxy, when in reality we are making calculated choices to minimize risk and maximize gain.\n\n**MYTH 4:** Yes, Singapore is a non-claimant state. We have no territorial claims in the South China Sea and we take no position on the claims of Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, China etc. But what we do have is an interest in FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION in the South China Sea (enshrined in international law, namely UNCLOS). We want our merchant ships carrying our imports and exports to be able to transition the South China Sea freely. Trade is the lifeblood of our free and open economy.\n\nNow, some mainland Chinese might argue that China has not explicitly threatened the right of freedom of navigation in the area. They are right. China has not demanded we pay a toll or tariff for passing through the area, not yet anyway. Hopefully it never does. But China\u2019s behavior of creating and militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea has not exactly inspired confidence on the part of Southeast Asian states regarding its future behavior.\n\nAnd in case you think our statement on the PCA\u2019s verdict was somehow \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d, let me read out the statement to you:\n\n>*Singapore has taken note of the Award made by the Arbitral Tribunal convened under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) on 12 July 2016 on the case between the Republic of the Philippines and the People\u2019s Republic of China. We are studying the Award and its implications on Singapore and the wider region.*  \n>  \n>*Singapore is not a claimant state and we do not take sides on the competing territorial claims. However, we support the peaceful resolution of disputes among claimants in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including Unclos, without resorting to the threat or use of force. As a small state, we strongly support the maintenance of a rules-based order that upholds and protects the rights and privileges of all states.*  \n>  \n>*Singapore values our long-standing and friendly relations with all parties, bilaterally and in the context of Asean. We urge all parties to fully respect legal and diplomatic processes, exercise self-restraint and avoid conducting any activities that may raise tensions in the region.*  \n>  \n>*Singapore supports the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the expeditious conclusion of a legally binding Code of Conduct in the South China Sea*\n\nIn other words, we did NOT even explicitly SUPPORT the ruling of the PCA in favor of the Philippines. We simply positively acknowledged the ruling and said that international law is important and we should all respect it. Can that be any less provocative? How could this be construed in any way as \u201ctaking sides\u201d? Are the Chinese really so thin-skinned that they object to us even SPEAKING about the SCS issue?\n\nLet me remind you that the PCA was the same court that ruled in favor of our dispute with Malaysia over Pedra Branca. So what would the implication be if we supported the PCA ruling for ourselves, but turned a blind eye to its ruling over the SCS? International law for me, but not for thee?\n\nNote also that Singapore was not alone: Vietnam, Myanmar, and Malaysia also positively acknowledged or outright supported the ruling of the PCA. Why did we deserve to be singled out for coercion?\n\nNon-alignment/neutrality is a PREFERENCE. It is not a solution. Singapore cannot prosper and be secure simply by pursuing a \u201chiding\u201d strategy of laying low and hoping not to be noticed. I will be happy to elaborate if you disagree. We host the US military because we consider it productive to our security interests (and that of regional security) for America to maintain a regional presence. This is to provide a counterweight to China and give us strategic space to maneuver. It is NOT to contain China or obstruct its rise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dl1v9eiudru41.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=674abcbdbdd903a8cc61d6b00f3ef61f0f2d92b0\n\nAnd while we are on the subject, we should note that the US military only maintains a purely rotational presence in Singapore. There are NO permanent US military bases or assets stationed here. The naval base which their aircraft carrier uses belongs to us. We should also further note that Singapore has NO formal treaty of alliance with America. In fact it is rumored that in 2003 America offered us the status of a major non-NATO ally - a formal security commitment from the US to defend Singapore\u2026and we rejected them. Now, is that how we would behave if we were really American proxies?\n\n*\u201cI am non-aligned in the sense that I do not want to be involved in power blocs\u2026but when my security, Singapore\u2019s survival, Singapore\u2019s prosperity is threatened, I cannot be neutral\u201d* \\- Lee Kuan Yew\n\n*\u201cSingapore has to take the world as it is, it is too small to change it. But we can try to maximise the space we have to maneuver among the big \u2018trees\u2019 in the region\u201d* \\- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man\u2019s View of the World, 2013\n\n**MYTH 5:** Kishore claimed that *\u201cnow that LKY is no longer with us, we should change our behaviour significantly\u2026we should be very restrained in commenting on matters involving Great Powers\u201d*. I agree with him that we should be circumspect, pragmatic, even cold-blooded, when it comes to dealing with Great Powers. We must tread carefully.\n\nBut has there been any fundamental change in Singapore\u2019s policy toward China post-LKY? No. Our relationship with the US goes back to the 1990s. Likewise with China we have always (and I emphasize, we CONTINUE to) promote the engagement of China with the region and the world. China must come to terms with the world order, just as the world order must accommodate China.\n\nThe Chinese like to grumble about the good old days of LKY and how well he got along with them. Again, they are not wrong. But this is a form of historical cherry-picking, of selective memory. Remember that LKY was one of the only Asian leaders to go up against a CCP-backed communist united front and win. Remember also that Mao\u2019s China issued frequent propaganda proclamations labelling him a \u201crunning dog\u201d of the West.\n\nLee Kuan Yew\u2019s views on China were not one-dimensional. They were complex and nuanced. They were tactful, yes, but honest and direct. He did not shy away from political incorrectness.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB4NwQ24Mpk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB4NwQ24Mpk)\n\n>*\u201cThe Chinese may make a miscalculation\u2026they may become assertive and pushy, which is contrary to their long-term interest, which is to win over the smaller countries in the south to their side\u201d* \\- Lee Kuan Yew, 2011  \n>  \n>*\u201c\\[My uncle-in-law\\] had this romantic idea that, you know, \\[China\\] is a land of my forefathers.

Yes, we are all lucky fellows. But the older generation has this romantic idea\u2026I discovered when I was a student in England, that I had more in common with the Singaporeans and Malaysians of other races than with the Chinese from China because they are completely different.

It is not an ABSOLUTE good, but it is good. China is a FRIEND, even if friends can be pushy at times and we do not always agree with our friends about everything all the time. Singapore and China have no fundamental clash of core interests. Indeed, I think it is possible for our core interests to align with China. Not only with China, but also with the US, India, Japan, etc. Whether or not it aligns with China to a greater degree than with other powers is to be seen, and in large part decided, by China\u2019s own behaviour.\n\nBut in any case if there is alignment, our lodestar must always be our NATIONAL INTEREST - Singapore\u2019s own national interest - determined by Singaporeans\u2019 own choices ALONE and no one else\u2019s, undiluted by the manipulation of ANY foreign entity. And in case you think I\u2019m only referring to China, go look at our handling of the 1988 Hendrickson Affair.\n\nHuang Jing was only one manifestation of this. **Foreign powers will continue to attempt to influence our policy.

It would be hypocritical of us to preach self determination, rejecting the negative Chinese influence, while blindly chasing our favourite idol groups, watching our favourite Kdramas, shopping at Korean marts, using the skin products etc etc. The same goes for the Japanese and probably any other significant cultural product. Perhaps what is fundamentally different is the facade of an insidious motive behind China's diplomacy.

The demographics of people I've met  and interacted with range from hippies, fresh grads, working class, middle class, fu-er-dais(2nd generation rich), 1st to 3rd tier city people as well as ethnic minorities including Tibetans and Uyghurs.\n\nFirst of all I really do find China politically today very similar to Singapore. Almost like a mirror image in many ways. No surprise since DXP and LKY were good friends and strong admirers of each other. Secondly most of the \"nationalism\" I felt is quite healthy. Like how you disagree with and hate your parents sometimes but ultimately still love them. There are also those who know that the CCP positions itself in a way that they want people to accept that there's no distinction between the party and the state. They have a lot to lose if they go against that doctrine and overwhelming majority has agreed that economic reform > political reform.\n\nIMHO Singapore is a country with very weak identity. I agree we are more vulnerable due to majority of ethnic chinese as well as language proficiency. If you are more jiak kantang, you will consume more anglo saxon media and train of thoughts will be more aligned to the west vice versa. But due to our bilingualism and hopefully with a healthy level of critical thinking and skepticism, we are able to find a middle ground which is pro Singapore.\n\nHowever we are also forgetting that being pro Singapore is not just for the chinese. We have our minorities who do not have the luxury of reading chinese and understanding China's cultural and political nuances as much as we do. They are pro Singapore with hints of Singaporean xenophobic characteristics. Because of that they are less inclined to seek to understand China and thus more likely to spout out ill-informed narratives too. This I have witnessed numerous times and trying to correct them may sometimes come across as being \"pro china\". But than again they are not the target audience of Chinese influence. Nevertheless that should change in order to seek a more balanced view.\n\nIf there are people who wish to be pro China I would say let them be because these are people who feel that national interest =/= personal interest and that is a freedom of choice. I am not too concerned about convincing them otherwise. Likewise for people who wish to be pro west. There are merits as well as flaws in both, non of which are universal too. So long as the govt doesn't keep making Singaporeans feel like 2nd class citizens in our own country we should be more than OK. I think since Donald Trump, the world may have ushered in a new era of inward looking politics. I'm of the opinion that political cycles come and go just like economic cycles. Both of which are closely linked.\n\nConsidering that we are a nation of immigrants and very young one too, older Singaporeans may feel that there's more affinity to this land than younger Singaporeans. Personally any country with strong nationalism is potentially capable of having it descend to fascism. We see today a rise in ultra right wing populist movements in the western hemisphere due to globalisation and immigration policies gone wrong. Assaults and hate crimes linked to racism and xenophobia are on the rise. Asians who were born and deeply assimilated in western societies are now given the message that their presence is conditional.\n\nThat's why I resist any patriotic urges I may have sometimes because if allowed to manifest too much it becomes unhealthy. But having the Singapore passport is damn shiok and I thank all the forces of universe for making that possible.\n\nFear of outsiders is on the rise despite the world being more globalised than it has ever been. China is no exception and they have the history to remind them of it. Century of humiliation/Boxer rebellion drum which the CCP has beaten with gusto for their foreign policy war cry. Western biases which are inherently false and deliberately toxic towards China doesn't help too. They probably wanted to destroy the reputation of the CCP but have instead wilfully destroyed the reputation of Chinese just as much. They fan the flames of Chinese nationalism as much as the CCP does. They probably don't want it and wasn't their strategy to begin with, but CCP had an easy task of gaining legitimacy from the population with that.\n\nMany PRCs I met feel more a sense of disappointment than anger when they are misunderstood. They always argue that they are held to different standards than the west and sometimes their victim mentality overrides their ability to be self critical. Confrontation comes when there is persistent blatant ignorance and this is applicable to everyone. All the more ideas have to be attacked with facts not prejudiced feelings. However the latter reaps better ROI for politicans running for office in liberal democracies. China be like \"two can play this game\"\n\nIn a way China sees itself \"under attack\" again by an alliance of antagonisers. Their inconsistencies with truth doesn't do them much favours and the deserve every criticism hurled towards them. But I have to say the lack of repercussions on western atrocities screams hypocrisy too.\n\n**Confucius says \u201cDon\u2019t complain about the snow on your neighbour\u2019s roof when your own doorstep is unclean.\u201d**\n\nIn fact I find more and more people from western lib dem being the ones nodding in agreement with Chinese narratives and partly also because they are more aware and ashamed of their own govt. To me I think that is more effective than trying to sway overseas chinese in SEA to their side. Making western lib dem govts lose their legitimacy from their own electorates is perhaps a much sweeter middle finger to the face than converting overseas chinese.

They were wrong.\n\nIt is not correct to say \"the ideology is wrong\" only because Soviet Union was defeated in last cold war. it was defeated because it has less hard power. Let me analyze why would USA be defeated in this cold war.\n\nNew technological revolution requires huge investment costs. How can the investment cost of the technological revolution in the international world be digested? The key is how many people can amortize this cost. The price of new technology products is determined by the denominator -- the amortized population. The failure of the Soviet Union was that the amortizing population was less than 500 million in its own system, and the North Atlantic system of the United States was 1 billion. And then China\u2019s 1 billion people joined the Western system. China used to be in the Soviet system and had a period of its own independent system. However, under the reform and opening up, Sino-US cooperation, the Western system became a scale of 2 billion people, which was a fundamental change. Therefore, China\u2019s cooperation with the United States was a win-win situation. China\u2019s rapid development and its consumer market amortized the cost of American technological investment cost. For Soviet Union, the cost for catching up cannot be amortized, and was becoming higher and higher, so it must fall in the confrontation of two superpowers.\n\nCurrently there is another technological revolution, represented by 5G. Behind 5G's technology is the future of communications and networking, and countries around the world are investing more. Huawei and other companies have invested heavily, the 5G patents from China is around 50%. the United States cannot collect patent fees anymore, and the labor costs of the US-led Western industry supply chain are way higher. How can the investment cost be amortized? Amortization is based on the denominator -- population, which China has 1.4 billion and the United States has 400 million, or the United States and other developed countries, in total 1 billion people, compared to China plus Africa and the countries along the Belt and Road, 3 billion people in total, Besides, labor cost in the West is several times higher than that of China and its partners. So we can see why the United States is on the losing side.\n\nWith this result, PRC's ideology will prevail.", "pundidas": "\\+1 on r/geopolitics this MUST go onto that sub.", "ned_stark97": "Nah, not a uni assignment lah, just a humble pastime :) No need to get butthurt because people refuse to get browbeaten by your black-and-white worldview\n\nI would dearly looooove to see you argue with some pro-China redditors though.

The Soviet Union also used a similar strategy for its nuclear submarines because they too had stealth characteristics that were inferior to that of the US navy; that, and the unique geography of the USSR made it very difficult to avoid naval containment (despite the USSR's vast coastline, most of it was iced up nearly year round). The Baltic and Black seas were (and still are) useless for ballistic missile submarine patrols because they were too shallow and crowded, and had chokepoints that made it impossible for SSBNs to slip into the anonymity of the open Atlantic ocean. To the west was the GIUK gap that was (formerly) heavily monitored by NATO forces. The eastern seaboard of the USSR was too underdeveloped and was too close to a then-hostile China. Therefore, Soviet ballistic missile submarines tended to loiter close to Soviet shores in remote Arctic areas that were heavily patrolled by naval aviation and naval forces.\n\nChina faces the same problem as the Soviet Union did (and Russia still does). China's geography is also locked in by territories (island chains) that are not controlled by allied countries. These islands (termed the \"first island chain\") are Taiwan, Japan, and the Philippines, and therefore the presence of US military monitoring facilities makes it difficult for Chinese submarine to leave into the relative anonymity safety of the open Pacific ocean because China's submarines are not yet sufficiently advanced as to reliably remain undetected. China is heavily investing in this technology and it's only a matter of time before they reach a rough parity with the US. But it's likely sooner or later though, since there have been significant improvements in the last half decade or so.\n\nYou can read a basic introduction to China's nuclear submarine posture [here](https://www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2015/tensions-south-china-sea-nuclear-dimension). People tend to think in terms of economic benefit, but if the country's very survival is at stake, economy takes a back seat. Like every country out there, and perhaps more than most (owing to the trauma of the 'century of humiliation'), China's preoccupation is survival.

This immigration and assimilation negates the dearth of organic talent, keeps the median age low (its already lower than China\u2019s), keeps the dependency ratio sustainable and keeps the consumption demographic at a healthy number. \n\nChina\u2019s 1 child policy, it\u2019s inability to increase the TFR since it\u2019s abolishment and it\u2019s hostile stance towards immigration bodes poorly for its demography.

None of these issues affect the Americans as much as they do China. \n\nPersonally for me, I feel China would have a better future investing in developing the western interior instead of trying to project power and dominate the region. Be a responsible actor in a rules based international order, try to foster a multicultural identity and be encouraging towards immigration and assimilation of talent. Centralisation of power is still necessary but it can be a benign authoritarianism instead of a repressive one. Focus on growing a sustainable economy which is not so export dependent. \n\nChallenging the Americans is a fool\u2019s errand.

More alarmingly, there were instances of thinly veiled racism and belittling of the cultures of other races here in Singapore.

Seriously? Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? \"Soft power\" does indeed exist, but rarely is it as \"soft\" as you'd expect. For example, Singapore's soft power lies largely in its good international repute its perceived integrity when it comes to international dealings, far beyond what most countries its size can achieve.
