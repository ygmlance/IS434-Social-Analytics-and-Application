g13r08,haikallp,the way i see it theres two areas the gov fucked up 1 not anticipating issues with dormitories in case an outbreak happen there 2 discouraging healthy people from wearing masks earlier on they did great in other aspects
g13r08,tryingmydarnest,very much i understand where the govt is coming from by introducing measures bit by bit to prevent fatigue these piecemeal measures do add to the confusion also i wonder what s the numbers for tonight sound like its going to be worse than last night that now mask wearing mandatory edit nvm just saw it s bad
g13r08,Zukiff,govt trying to get that 600 back from boomers s

g13r08,HerrNoel,finally it has come to this don t know whether to be happy or sad that our own bubble of exceptionalism has finally been burst
g13r08,iszyyy,i feel like its one thing to make people wear masks but i ve seen loads of uncles who dont cover their noses or just pull it down to the chin
g13r08,jinhong91,wait a minute how come the task force personnel didn t wear any mask they are in air conditioned room which makes it easier to spread the virus they should lead by example and start wearing masks
g13r08,Shoki81,i predict many will test the system n outdoor exercise will be ban also
g13r08,UmichAgnos,please don t wear medical grade disposables especially if you have not been fitted correctly for them donate to hospitals or elder care facilities instead i just saw an old man totally wasting a n95 it was so oversized for him i could see a 1cm gap between the lower part of the mask and his neck from about 5m away he is better off wearing any other mask
g13r08,zeratul123x,i disagree with many of the government s policies and actions but you can t help but feel bad for them they just can t win tell people to wear mask early overreaction kiasu government too scared fearmongering tell people wear mask now flipflop knee jerk no confidence damned if they do damned if they don t
g13r08,6Hee9,get a full face gas mask and train like the cbre guys do
g13r08,JJYEO,not trying to downplay the government s effort to tackle covid 19 but a more steadfast and better planning should have been done to adopt the wear mask policy in the early days of the outbreak
g13r08,eggsvy20,fuck la might as well declare dorscon red
g13r08,Nv2U,one free mask is not enough with this requirement what are you supposed to do if it wears out breaks is lost can t go out to buy new one nowhere to order because sold out there needs to be a solution
g13r08,AZGzx,i think it s important to make changes when necessary we don t know if tw or hk did the right thing until it was evident for all you know it could have gone the other way then hk and tw ppl will be blasting them
g13r08,Invalesco_POE,of course there are certain things the govt has done which could have been improved however the situation has evolved everyone knows that masks are helpful in preventing infections however how useful are they we didn t have any statistics back then and still don t to prove exactly how effective they would be in preventing covid and if it would be significant enough a preventive measure to possibly risk shortage of supply if everyone panic bought some of the initial advice was still correct that washing hands properly and practising proper hygiene is more effective in preventing covid infections because it is if people panic bought masks and we ran out of masks for healthcare workers it would have been disastrous if we ended up having healthcare clusters a shortage of healthcare workers due to quarantine and an overburdened healthcare system as a result given that the past week has seen a surge of cases there is probably now a worry that we would exceed our bed capacity if this continues given also that our supply of masks has now improved compared with feb mar if you balance the risks and benefits again it probably makes sense to change the initial advice and to ensure singaporeans wear masks and take maximum precautions even now doctors in some departments still have our masks rationed and are limited to 1 mask per day to prevent overconsumption
g13r08,Anniem0sity,can people still smoke after this immediate implementation i wonder
g13r08,FeefaPlayer,i would rather wear a mask when going for a run why it s because running routes are usually in circles and there s always another runner coming in opposite direction towards you he breathes you breathe in the same air space and multiply that with a number of laps
g13r08,SpongeBobBobPants,prata flips becoming so common now
g13r08,saggitas,well when you get downvoted 5 times straight with no comments you know what kind of ppl they are
g13r08,Talkingtomytoilet,i think anyone with common sense would not heed the advice from who especially when the pro ccp guy is chief and it s not hindsight people from all corners in singapore along with korean and taiwan experts plus the doctors aforementioned are already screaming for people to wear masks in feb but the ministers choose to ignore the pleas and prioritized the economy over people s health distributing reusable masks which they are doing now anyway will not cause an acute shortage medical staff use the disposable ones instead so your point is moot
g13r08,icarus-2,and i stepped out of my neighborhood today the first time in 2 weeks to quickly get a haircut at qb house those of you also planning for a haircut https www channelnewsasia com news asia covid19 malaysia movement control barber hair salon optometrists 12637110 you should do it fast i expect further lockdown measures

g13r08,Gibbo236,fair enough you are right i think stories of people flouting rules have driven me to a point where i have not considered cases like what you ve mentioned
g13r08,pm_me_pm_speeches,can you still take the mask down for a minute to drink water and put it back on afterwards

g13r08,-_af_-,usually when you see new measures announced it is usually during the press conference with the new numbers
g13r08,pinkguyfriedrice,nah they were indecisive rules changing every other day means they can only see 2 days ahead too much pride to admit their initial call was wrong

g13r08,8125def,apparently they did not learn from what happened to china then to europe and the us taiwan were fast enough to implement measures and now they are the safest place in asia you can see how policies remain stagnant in feb and now they are changing every 2 days the virus gives no fuck to indecisiveness and arrogance
g13r08,Vooshka,medical staff wore masks as they are exposed to sick people giving them a higher change of contracting the disease due to proximity and exposure to increased viral loads
g13r08,jurongbirdparksg,yep as late as the beginning of april https www straitstimes com singapore health coronavirus benefits of mask use among healthy people topic of debate in singapore doctors were divided on whether to implement mandatory mask wearing even dr paul tambyah from sdp noted that the evidence on routes of transmission and the efficacy of homemade reusable masks was still hazy
g13r08,duckington92,don t worry once they approach you and you start running away from them you re exercising again
g13r08,XYTB,the reusable masks tore so easily when i tried to wear them uhh i don t think my face is that big
g13r08,FriedCuttleFish,agreed at least have the decency to wear it correctly if wearing n95 mask don t wear it half fuck way
g13r08,OneRollingTomato,for the reusable mask they gave i don t think it s possible leh made of cloth sia my father was saying he felt it was hard to breathe wearing that and cycling
g13r08,maeverickmind,i actually don t get all the rage about the decisions gov been making or calling them indecisive the way i see it you monitor situations you adjust and update rules as the situation changes what works for other countries in early stages such as compulsory mask wearing may not necessarily work for us esp knowing what kind of pattern singaporeans are like so it does now then update the rules we wear masks then just wear lah this is unprecedented and for something like this i feel that there s a lot of preparedness already on the their end you can t possibly predict and prepare everything that s not how life works
g13r08,The9isback,like i said that part of the science is not necessarily definitive and definitely not newly developed in the last week having a half assed week 1 of cb just to change the mask policy into week 2 is asinine if they had made it mandatory from day 1 i m sure more people would have gone to collect their masks sooner instead of waiting during the week
g13r08,fibbermeister,it s important to bear in mind that you cannot treat a massive group of people like an individual
g13r08,A-Chicken,actually the govt told people not to wear masks unless they were sick that s because of a shortage and the fact that scalpers were trying to make buck on masks of questionable source and quality also this was advice from the who its head was the source of the wear masks only when you re sick advice i mean there s plenty of similar controversies surrounding him too
g13r08,UnfairHelicopter,when in doubt err on the side of caution just wear the masks
g13r08,HElovesF1,look i have the same thoughts you can look through my post history i was questioning if we were getting complacent back in early mid march when us and europe went into lockdowns while we are still carrying on life as usual and the lax shn measures too what i m saying is we can say what we want about the past but there is no point because we have to look ahead and anticipate the next move

g13r08,smalldog257,i was expecting another amendment of the covid 19 temp measures act but there s nothing in egazette
g13r08,AutisticPiano,few days ago i commented something like anything is better than nothing and got about same number of down votes as you do now oh the irony
g13r08,acekingspade,reminds of the whole pmd saga how they changed the regulations so people had to buy new pmds and then banned them not long after
g13r08,whitetigertrainer,police not wearing mask get over here
g13r08,HuDragon,i really admire the hongkongers they have a joker ccp bootlicking government that gives zero fuck about the people so they ve adapted and learn to survive through collective social responsibility
g13r08,PmMeYourNoobz,the singapore sme way
g13r08,windiven,no whatever country that the chief of who likes does not undermine the research done by the scientists there there is no benefit to be gained by the who for sabotaging the entire world with false research whether people wear masks or not doesn t affect the economy only the decision to lockdown does but either way containing the virus is the best way to help the economy it is not a dichotomy of either economy or public health the ministers were doing what they can to maintain some semblance of normalcy when the virus was still pretty contained because stopping the economy is going to harm the vulnerable who doesn t have much savings the most it is a legitimate tradeoff and tough balance to strike it is not an issue of face or greed in wanting to keep the economy going you think accumulating 5 million reusable masks is easy when every other country in the world is trying to hoard masks for themselves telling people to wear masks when not having enough reusable masks to distribute will cause an acute shortage
g13r08,Xstreamly99,i tot that s more of gen z haha
g13r08,giidi,we are both now we were too slow and have lost control hence overreacting
g13r08,PMmePunnyJokes,yes hang it at door put it on with shoes always unless you are under 2
g13r08,imhotunderthesun,depends if there is a crowd outside
g13r08,han5henman,not random testing but accessible testing i think using per capita testing as a guide isn t very accurate while korea s per capita numbers are lower than singapores their outbreak was centered around daegu a city with 2 5 million people now i cannot find figures to show how many of their 500 000 tests were carried out in daegu but even if we assume only 10 of those 500 000 tests happened in daegu they ve got singapore beat per capita and keep in mind that more than 50 of koreas cases came from daegu so 10 is probably low anyways at the end of the day i m just some guy stuck at home only one country has got their covid numbers under control since having a sruge and we would be foolish to not follow in their footsteps
g13r08,PavanJ,where aside from social media were people being shamed for wearing a mask edit i ask a question and i get downvotes
g13r08,DancingHeroEatYouUp,during exercise when lots of sweat is absorbed by a surgical mask it will be very hard to breathe unless you loosen it i m guessing thats why they allow no mask during exercising for the free reusable masks though i m not sure just read your edit you do have a point imo give it a few days and exercise will probably be not allowed
g13r08,Bearswithjetpacks,for one i think the task force in charge of dealing with this pandemic needs to be transparent with citizens and announce potential measures and actions they re considering for the coming months and educate citizens on the rationale behind major changes we could rip into the mistakes already made and point fingers but all that does is allow us ti vent frustrations what is upsetting now is that there is no indication that the people deciding the fates of the lives of many singaporeans have any clear idea what they plan to do no timeline no direction stricter measures would have made a world of difference earlier we re beyond that and i d like to know now what contingencies are being implemented and are there still more does the authority behind this have a plan for recovery for the long term and can the citizens be informed of their role does singapore have a plan masks weren t the issue the lack of foresight and leadership the lack of social responsibility and etiquette and unity these are the issues this turned into a rant more than anything so i ll stop myself here i think what could have been an opportunity to present singapore as a competent and attractive model to follow has and is still being wasted and it s embarrassing and infuriating
g13r08,AyysforOuus,it s really hard to breath especially when you re excersising
g13r08,nlim2004,not everyone had masks or a sufficent supply by then they announced it when everyone was already given the chance to collect reusable masks first it s not about them not being able to make up their minds it s about them ensuring that everyone has been given the chance already been given the masks or were told to collect so they no longer have the excuse that they do not have masks so they aren t fined unfairly because of them not having enough masks edit added last clause
g13r08,boysachok,can t always pleased people when early2 implement people will ask what for no need laaa when got a lot of cases already people will ask now then want to implement etc2
g13r08,Shaftronics,some athletes do it to acclimate their bodies to lower oxygen levels not great for your muscles however

g13r08,ThatAndresV,i got downvoted to fuck the other day for suggesting it but perhaps the folks doing strenuous exercise might restrict those activities to indoors just for a little while

g13r08,savagehardin,90 electro techno music intensify
g13r08,deangsana,given that we still have so many people pushing boundaries of the circuit breaker and even breaking the rules at this point i think if we went lockdown earlier it would be even worse in terms of compliance as the fear factor of contagion would have been less
g13r08,letterboxmind,provide the source for the initial global reports that you speak of
g13r08,troublesome58,come on la who has time to go understand their rules when they change everyday like cpf withdrawal age only keyboard warriors who are too free

g13r08,sonastyinc,https edition cnn com 2020 01 31 health coronavirus asymptomatic spread study index html https www nejm org doi full 10 1056 nejmc2001468 query featured_home
g13r08,ash322,i can validate your point
g13r08,Kopi0Kosong,i think the government was wrong to say in the beginning that people shouldn t wear a mask they were basically shaming people that were voluntarily wearing a mask that was wrong of them they should ve let people that were wearing a mask wear one of course the advisory itself to only wear one of sick was following who
g13r08,AtreiaDesigns,the best part is the people who are compaining about these changes are also the ones who are stubbornly acting and causing these changes to come aboutn
g13r08,H3nt4iB0i96,i think most of the studies both before and during this pandemic that i find indicate that masks are largely ineffective at preventing a healthy wearer from catching the virus when taken alone but the nuance is that there appears to be evidence to suggest that it may be quite effective at preventing spread if an infected person uses them since this prevents some of the release of droplets into the air this was what informed the initial stance on masks but what i think they failed to recognise was that a asymptomatic spread was possible and quite common meaning that you may be able to spread the virus even when you don t show any clear symptoms and b infected people with mild symptoms might not heed the warning to use face masks a caveat to a here is that whether or not masks can prevent asymptomatic spread still hasn t been established however i think there s an extremely high likelihood of this being the case and it s really really better to be safe than sorry also the main reason why this was enacted only just now was because the government had just finished giving out its masks so they can justify policy like this
g13r08,DuePomegranate,that s a ridiculously small study and it actually shows that cloth masks are more effective than surgical masks viral load is measured on log scale so when patient 1 wore the cloth mask and reduced the viral load from 3 53 to 2 27 log copies ml that was a 10 1 26 18 2 fold reduction and patient 3 reduced the viral load by 12 6 fold surely reducing the viral load that you are spewing out by 10 20 fold is important
g13r08,tehtf,they aren t able to keep up the supply with the demand no gov intervention on export nationalized and ration mask production mask gouging shoot up the roof ppl are hoarding arbitrary selling masks and create a country panic
g13r08,stiggz83,and yet we are still in this position shows the flaws in their actions
g13r08,Brisrascal,diy waterboarding
g13r08,_krypton99,but walking back home even tho it s a short distance like 100m still need wear mask right
g13r08,forkboot,i ll probably be doing some vertical running walking in a few days
g13r08,MadKyaw,well they certainly don t wear surgical reusable masks
g13r08,zeroX26,that s not how hypoxic training works you need to change the o2 concentration seriously
g13r08,dontknowwhattodoat18,little did they know that the altitude mask gives minimal to no change at all to your training
g13r08,lanyingjie,35 or 39 i was 39 we had to do the mask runs regularly
g13r08,pendelhaven,you dunno meh asking people to stop running for a few weeks due to a pandemic is like killing their family like that running get covid nvm but no run will die
g13r08,raspberrih,i heard go up ok go down is bad for knees
g13r08,Eskipony,i think if the cases in our migrant worker community weren t exploding our cb measures would be ignored by a large part of the population
g13r08,StuStuffedBunny,yea but they could ve also announced that free mask giveaway but as soon as this is done masks will be a requirement it definitely feels indecisive
g13r08,dragonflysg,finish him
g13r08,syanda,aiyah just run up and down staircase can alr
g13r08,kopipeng,cdc recommends any cloth face coverings to protect and help to slow the spread of covid 19 https www cdc gov coronavirus 2019 ncov prevent getting sick diy cloth face coverings html this advice did not exist up until april because scientific research based on cases at that time suggest that asymptomatic transmission is unlikely of course with more cases means researchers have new and more data to work with which results in a different advice that does not mean the initial mask advice is wrong it is just no longer valid with new scientific evidence it s part of science if you didn t know up until april we did not have a reusable mask stockpile because if we did the g would have released that instead of surgical masks which have far more utility for healthcare workers compared to the general public the rationale behind the mask advice has never changed from the start mask up to protect others from catching the virus not yourself surgical masks cannot protect you from catching the virus because the water droplets can land in your eye or enter through your ear which is why healthcare workers wear full ppe initially mask up if you are sick because if you have symptoms you may have the virus since asymptomatic transmission was unlikely based on evidence at that time now mask up all the time because you may unknowingly carry and transmit the virus because asymptomatic transmission is highly likely based on evidence at this time yeah so like aiya no asymptomatic study to prove then nvm la let them cough in the air hand and touch here and there right use common sense la bodoh i feel lucky that you re probably no where in the public service because if there were people like you who justify everything on arbitiary common sense which might as well be irrational feelings our system would have been crippled decision making especially at the national level has to be evidence based with consideration for your current realities and weighing tradeoffs not to mention without name calling just to prove your point
g13r08,ybct,that time china closed factories cos of cny then couldn t reopen cos of virus so surgical mask shortage globally want to buy for how much also don t have the more you say people should wear when it is impossible to get the more they will panic and there was no proof fabric masks helped which was why we did not have a stockpile of fabric masks to give out now we are desperate and surgical masks are still in short supply coupled with new research that says it s better than nothing so it took time to procure the few million fabric masks the govt was giving out again no point saying people should have it when people cannot get it all you will achieve is mass panic and then people will start hoarding everything else
g13r08,fallingstarrs,likely singapore s ppe production would not be done locally due to land space higher wages etc and set up overseas then you come back to the issue of countries blocking exports of masks ppe for their own national interests like what happened with taiwan and what the us is doing globally
g13r08,ylyn,it doesn t matter anything helps come on
g13r08,chellice,pretty sure he s joking
g13r08,woowombat,you have a point but hk had a law during that time that prohibited any wearing of masks and the public chose to ignore it and do the smart thing anyway macau on the other hand wasn t letting anyone on public transport without a mask several weeks ago

g13r08,jangwookop,this it s easy to say everyone should wear masks early on with the benefit of hindsight
g13r08,junnies,you can always calibrate policy and recommendations to what is feasible explain that due to limited supply of masks we need to ration it for medical staff and frontline staff retail phv medical etc who interact with many people in crowded places encourage or even mandate mask wearing for those who are most likely to be super spreaders due to their social interactions or those in close contact to confirmed or suspected cases implement and practice social distancing so that community spread is minimal etc etc it doesn t have to be all or nothing of either healthy no need wear mask or all must wear masks or be fined
g13r08,localinfluenza,u wear mask during the initial period ppl will ask u why u wear mask u sick ah
g13r08,RawOnionRings,it was back in feb and during peak hours on the mrt and mrt was packed load of people so this auntie just moved away from me and shifted to somewhere with group of people not wearing masks and doesn t look sick to her it caused those people in the cabin to turn heads and stare at me like i did something wrong or like i m really sick which i m not i also had one time when i sat down with a mask during off peak hours on the mrt beside an uncle this uncle turned and stared at me before getting up and moving to sit beside someone without mask and once again those people in the cabin stared at me wondering what had happened

g13r08,Revalent,i m not disagreeing with you in the aspect that we should be looking into what we can do next you are right however my point is that for that particular point hindsight can not be a valid excuse
g13r08,isparavanje,would you prefer random testing there are limited tests even with mass testing no country has enough pcr machines to test the whole population like you re envisioning so symptoms and close contact is used as a guide everywhere including korea

g1j2mi,i_hate_pennies,here s a question i haven t seen answered what about bike riding that s considered as a part of strenuous exercise also do you have to wear a mask while riding a bike to run errands it s like a 1000 degrees in singapore and i can t see myself surviving bike rides while wearing a mask

g1j2mi,exprtcar,well i m sure enforcement will understand as long as it s obvious you re going there immediately alternatively ask a neighbour
g1j2mi,smalldog257,no the regulations defines a mask like this homemade masks are fine but a t shirt wrapped around your head isn t mask includes any paper textile or plastic covering designed or made to be worn over the nose and mouth to provide the wearer protection against infections or air pollution

g1j2mi,MrBottle,is the corridor as part of your father s place of residence
g1j2mi,Calikura,my experience my experience my experience everybody else s experience a good mask worn sufficiently tightly and covering enough of the face does make it more difficult for people to breathe a mask worn properly should make it difficult to run if you can still take huge breaths the mask might not be of very good quality and or there are large enough gaps between the mask and your face
g1j2mi,zoomtzt,can is can lah but if i already find it difficult to breathe properly through a mask while walking wearing one while running doesn t seem very practical
g1j2mi,transcendcosmos,hope you never become a policy maker because such roles require empathy
g1j2mi,jurongbirdparksg,yeah but when you re exercising your mask will most likely get wet from sweat and condensation and that s likely to make it less effective or even increase your risk of transmission

g0j3cw,Aphelion,its reported col eric chua
g0j3cw,justasmallkid,reported him on oneservice app waiting for their response if the response is unsatisfactory will give 1 rating on appstore
g0j3cw,smart_26panties,there was a guy who gave out free packs of 3 masks outside jcube on sunday he just want to do it he says he did it properly not standing near us i was really touched
g0j3cw,marvelsman,he knows the ground my friend s parents have a stall in av and morale has been really low due to the diminished business but they were very happy that dr chia came down to check on them
g0j3cw,mystroseeker,and he is a doctor by training
g0j3cw,6Hee9,chia shi who
g0j3cw,Legendtrophylover,take it easy on him la he went to give out masks and support the community all the f b folks also need some mental support the photos are a bit too much though hahaha
g0j3cw,mookanana,today s complaint why mp walk around during circuit breaker yesterday and tomorrow s complaint mp don t even know what s going on in his estate they don t even know the ground situation
g0j3cw,StevenLimKorKor,what is the point of showcasing a new face if he is wearing a mask kind of defeats the purpose isn t it
g0j3cw,xenobyte2,tan kin lian is that you
g0j3cw,Varantain,i m curious why today cherry picked the workers party statement which was made on 26 march the circuit breaker announcement https www pmo gov sg newsroom pm lee hsien loong on the covid19 situation in singapore on 3 april 2020 was made on 3 april 2020 just over one week after the wp statement on the other hand chia shi lu s walkabout to distribute masks with an entourage was yesterday i don t think the wp would want to commit political suicide by having an entourage of one to two volunteers staff members or non constituency mps anymore
g0j3cw,Pyrrylanion,if he really know his ground then he shouldn t be on a non essential walkabout in the first place the government has been telling us that if we have no need to go out don t and this joker decide to walk around the neighbourhood and taking pictures with everyone shouldn t mp lead by example are we supposed to be happy that he managed to cheer up some of his constituents but made a mockery of our efforts to fight a crisis it takes everyone to fight covid including this joker who thinks a walkabout is essential even shamugam teleconferenced for media interviews showing that mps have no excuse to do anything contrary to measures for fighting this virus while your friend s parents may be happy i don t think many singaporeans are satisfied with his actions especially when most people regard walkabouts as do nothing mps wayang to show that they are alive and not idk dead or something perhaps its good effort but definitely lousy pr
g0j3cw,IvanLu,the problem is well intentioned or not stubborn people will now have an excuse to use when flouting circuit breaker rules if mp can do that why can t i i m here to cheer and support my friend s business too
g0j3cw,nosajpersonlah,downvotes for going against the hive mind oof
g0j3cw,Tempestuous-,like that also happy
g0j3cw,PmMeYourNoobz,idk leh this kind of thing is just a pr movem why would anyone but pap s morale be lifted because some well paid mp visit give angpao then okay la
g0j3cw,lordzealous,but now a politician for life
g0j3cw,AutoModerator,facebook links are not allowed on this subreddit i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r singapore if you have any questions or concerns
g0j3cw,houganger,yeah agree really mis timed pr if it really was well intentioned he really shouldn t have taken those photos and used them as pr material
g0j3cw,letterboxmind,exactly he should be setting a good example by observing circuit breaker rules
g0j3cw,SamBellFromSarang,so majority of muslims are peaceful but isis are terrorist means muslim cannot practice islam liao is it i said this in the original comment thread and i ll say it again he s promoting safety by distributing masks and boosting morale in the community perhaps you can argue that the photo op is unncessary and i would 100 agree but him making his rounds is not really the issue at hand sinkies just want to pwn sinkies
g0j3cw,tj3333,surprisingly yes it s comforting to know that your mp listens to your concerns not only that most hawkers associations are actually extremely close with the mps grassroots advisors and there is an extremely robust feedback system between them
g0j3cw,Shuyi000,what the fuck you talking about no link leh bro
g0j3cw,Windreon,considering the party message is to suspend meet the people sessions and any ground engagements home visits this guy super blur sotong
g0j3cw,caramellocone,but nothing wrong with checking how your people are doing during the cb yeah i m sure the virus gives exceptions to mps going around visiting so you think he did something illegal should go complain to shanmugan see what he says it doesn t need to be illegal for it to be wrong your logic is seriously retarded
g0j3cw,300maan,ikr should issue them the fine since 300 also no kick to him and they ll also get the 600 everyone gets later
g0j3cw,123dream321,to be honest i still don t know if ground engagement is allowed or not wp has also temporarily stopped these sessions at its wards in hougang and aljunied it has also halted all house visits for the time being but its mps and town councillors will continue to inspect the estates with the help of one to two volunteers staff members or non constituency mps the party said in a statement on march 26 read more at https www todayonline com singapore pap stops all ground engagements until may 4 due covid 19
g0j3cw,zed_j,on your logic for anyone s job that needs to manage relationship with counterparties visiting them is essential and even if that is essential why bring along a photographer is the photographer essential why does the mp have an exception when he should in fact be held to a higher standard he s not immune to covid19 neither is the photographer
g0g50r,sgtaguy,this page is 100 cancer almost up there at the top with fabrications about the pap basically what states times review would be if they were on the other extreme end of the political scale
g0g50r,cxrossfire,lol ok you know what s the funny thing a few weeks back i also saw anti pap netizens claiming taiwan govt bought up all the mask making machines first when the pandemic first broke out then they complaining why pap never do that first and chope all the machines go and let taiwan chope everything then now we not enough mask so they kb pap never selfishly hoard masks first and let taiwan hoard then now pro pap page kb taiwan hoard lol really regardless of what s the truth people will just twist it to however they wanna believe

g0g50r,DrCalFun,thank you the judgement of falsehood and how it affects public interests would come from the incumbent government s who has the data i am fairly certain their judgement is more aligned with mine it takes time to cover a shortfall the government maintains a stable stockpile whatever is drawn down has to be put back and the shortfall will take at least two months to refill frankly after your explanation i still don t know why you say it will not be any time soon that sg matters will be pofma i can only think that it s because you don t think it will be applied equally
g0g50r,3lungs,not sure if that s me you re referring to but taiwan did start buying mask making machines once they got news that the chinese citizens worldwide were sweeping masks and sending it back to china i got this info from my friends in taiwan apparently the one who noticed was in charge of buying was the vice premier only difference is that i believe it s always harder to beat the person you re observing you see taiwan buying machines and by that moment in time they ve already contacted the sellers and arranged for quotations etc very hard for you to get ahead of them unless you already have connections to sellers

g0g50r,pigzailee,is this article supposed to show how toc is factually wrong in this instance because i ve translated it and can t see it unless you re stating that being pofmaed once is supposed to be a benchmark for the trustworthiness of a particular article in which case that s not the case pofma is per incident and toc has not become a declared online location like states times review
g0g50r,bondbandito,ah yes whataboutism to deflect criticsm the playbook of statists
g0g50r,pingmr,thank you the judgement of falsehood and how it affects public interests would come from the incumbent government s who has the data i am fairly certain their judgement is more aligned with mine i thought you earlier said sg matters has the data though just to refresh your memory how do you know that they don t have evidence ho ching posted 9 weeks ago on st engineering shifting production to singapore due to taiwan ban which we still have to source for raw materials btw and chan chu seng s leak recording on the government taking a gamble with the mask situation in feb and the youtube video of the taiwanese chief covid 19 official confirming that they disrupted our ability to provide masks how are these not evidence they have they know the numbers so just to check if we re on the same page that the data is with the government and not sg matters it takes time to cover a shortfall the government maintains a stable stockpile whatever is drawn down has to be put back and the shortfall will take at least two months to refill the points you raise here are valid but again they don t support sg matter s conclusion that if not for the taiwan export ban we d have more than enough masks with the ban we drew down on the stockpile and we now have to replenish that if the ban did not happen we would still need to maintain the same stockpile i really just come back to the point that having 1 million extra masks at this point heck even if we doubled the amount to 2 million we won t have more than enough masks and we won t have left over to give away again even with super generous estimations of 2 million masks being the opportunity cost sg matter s statement is false this is using numbers that you yourself provided multiplied by two just to be generous frankly after your explanation i still don t know why you say it will not be any time soon that sg matters will be pofma i can only think that it s because you don t think it will be applied equally sg matter s statement that singapore would have more than enough masks with leftover to help others is false they don t have the data for it they aren t going to be pofma ed
g0g50r,StewYourSoul,i think you have some serious problems with simple comprehension the dude above stated many times he doesn t believe either parties should be subjected to pofma but if you stood by the opinion that toc should be pofma ed then sgmatters should as well for similar reasons is it that hard to grasp quoting you on this they have they know the numbers what proof or evidence do you have on your part that they indeed have such evidence are you a part of the sg matters page and privy to certain data unlike the general public if you are not then your claims that they have any such evidence is horseshit looking at your data driven argument here you assume the capacity is more than 1m a month since it wasn t running on full capacity so at what capacity was it operating at you wouldn t know and you re just making estimation here on your part but sure i ll give it to you for the sake of your argument once again you assume only 30 40 of our healthcare workers would require n95 masks is there any evidence to support your estimation of 30 40 yep i thought so too lastly the poster specifically found fault with sg matters claim that we would have excess masks to export to other countries if taiwan didn t hinder our production i am sure with your great interest in the subject matter that you know there is a global supply chain holdup relating to the key material needed to produce the n95 masks are you sg matters privy to any information that suggests singapore has contracts in place with any suppliers of the key material therefore making sure we have a healthy supply of the material to produce upwards of 1m masks monthly didn t think so too are you aware of our current supply of the key material needed to produce the n95 masks and therefore our current ability to produce the n95 masks with full capacity didn t think so once again so how can sg matters and you be sure that we would have excess to export to others if not for the tw situation err you can t so if toc should be pofma ed for half truths as per your words it is fair game for sg matters to be pofma ed

g1umu6,Tongchokgoh,cna newsreaders don t wear masks are they supposed to
g1umu6,miredonas,i think it is a trade off a lot of people on pavements are now subject to runners vapor while going groceries one asymptomatic runner can infect easily tens of people on their way in one exercise session maybe a better alternative is banning running on pavements if this happened already it is not implemented in my neighborhood yet

g1ousj,FOTW-Anton,i think a heavy fine or a short jail sentence for her would be a good start
g1ousj,IrateTeitoku,imagine a vigilante group dedicated to beating the shit out of people who have masks but simply refuse to mask up x200b we could call them the crusaders of circuit breaker ccb
g1ousj,haikallp,oh yeah my bad
g1ousj,SeieiEnbu,on the other hand i think the fact that law enforcement in singapore does not normalise violence towards civilians speaks volumes about how civilised our society is in general i mean sure cops in delhi crack down hard on people breaking quarantine but people piss in the street and women get gang raped and murdered there too
g1ousj,bbfasiaolang,er i prefer my mata to not brutalize me why are you fan of dutete murder squad
g1ousj,honey_102b,circuit breaker key individual agents henceforth to be also known as the cb kias

g0x1i7,SamBellFromSarang,amdk mentions singapore singaporeans heavy breathing
g0x1i7,long_AMZN,masks work in a sense that they reduce spread of the virus masks do not protect the uninfected wearer from the virus though
g0x1i7,shitoupek,yup this worked well in taiwan and hk wearing masks since the beginning
g0x1i7,Cyanaliq,they do though not much but they do they reduce viral load someone coughs at you if you have a mask some droplets get caught in the mask and your initial infection has a lower viral load
g0x1i7,swordtailsg,i viewed this in the morning am surprised hank mentioned singapore a good video i must say definitely makes a lot of sense
g0x1i7,JustSomeRand0mGuy,heavy breathing fap fap fap fap
g0x1i7,bbfasiaolang,feels so good amdk love me pls rock hard
g0x1i7,Orangecuppa,pretty much history will judge us for underestimating asymptomatic cases altho the original reasoning of masks for frontline only is good due to supply the usage of reusables should have been enforced early on
g0x1i7,FitCranberry,uaaagh
g0x1i7,bondbandito,nope got caught off caught with inadequate supplies shifted goalposts from stockpiles being sufficient for citizens to saying oh emergency stockpiles means only for the few involved
g0x1i7,JusticePeril,did the gamble pay off
g15x6k,Drink82,i just tried the government issued masks and breathing is quite tough underneath the fabric given then new registration what s most comfortable to wear
g15x6k,boysachok,i think disposable mask is still the best
g15x6k,septeal,if you can breathe freely in it then that mask is not filtering shit
g15x6k,7_92x57_mm_Mauser,it s impossible to get one anyway either they don t have stock or they won t sell it to you
g15x6k,mrbearishungry2018,https www straitstimes com lifestyle four other dubious mask alternatives can t really say which good ones out there but if they can fit your face and give some protection i think it is better than no mask which will lead to a 300 fine now
g15x6k,itoku-sg,make your own as you ve said i also find the issued mask too small and too thick i ve made one myself following the videos on youtube
g15x6k,woowombat,none of the locally available reusable masks are very good but i ve seen a few impressive ones on people in public no idea where they re getting them from
g15x6k,Zukiff,i m using the 1929 mask it s comfortable to wear the entire day essential services need to wear entire day
g15x6k,pupusan,guys pitta masks do not help prevent spread of viruses or bacteria they re meant to help the user reduce the risk of pollen and dust allergies
g15x6k,Angryangmo,i was thinking the same just now also the government issues mask doesn t fit my son where can we buy reusable masks for the little ones
g15x6k,Drink82,it s filtering a 300 dollar fine
g15x6k,UmichAgnos,you can hang the cotton mask over the cartridges to cover the exhaust that s what i am doing
g15x6k,ThatAndresV,wouldn t a valve be there to make it easy for the wearer to exhale if so i can see how that s helpful for haze but it seems selfish for the current situation
g15x6k,Raraan,the surgical one hurts my ears though how
g15x6k,jdickey,singapore the finest city in pap pte ltd land
g15x6k,maolyx,saw some kids reusable masks at unity in early mid march maybe can try there
g15x6k,bbfasiaolang,pitta has a prettt bad smell though i used to wear it even before it was cool and yeah it smells bad ez to breathe compared to n95 and govt cloth mask but reality the only thing it protects from is the fine
g15x6k,wanhiin,exactly this the primary use of a face mask in a pandemic is to prevent possible spread of virus from yourselves to other symptomatic or otherwise valved masks are designed for haze or industrial work providing comfort and form but very little in real function in this covid 19 climate
g15x6k,ylyn,anything helps if a pitta mask is the only mask someone will wear for the whole day then i rather they wear that and keep it on rather than wear a better mask and keep taking it off
g0y3ky,silver5182,some are more equal than others
g0y3ky,itoku-sg,if it s solely for the distribution of masks it should be give and go he still have time to take photos with the store owners as if it s for election campaigning this is certainly not essential and should be looked into for flouting the cb law
g0y3ky,FitCranberry,thats just logical
g0y3ky,jkohlc,essential service for essential voters
g0y3ky,dunspamme,here is an interesting thought experiment what if the person meeting hawkers and giving out masks was dr chee soon juan what do you think would happen
g0y3ky,potatokid07,yeah you are right risk assessment should be put in place and good thing i live alone hence the initiative on a side note i m saddened with the fact that many eldery go collect themselves
g0y3ky,ballsie995,set precedence that giving face mask to essential worker is allowed while wearing mask and social distancing election issues aside
g0y3ky,Tempestuous-,because he can
g0y3ky,Darkblade48,singaporean good singaporean pap better
g0y3ky,k0lv,can someone file a report on him please
g0y3ky,lawlianne,maybe rip behind bars again
g0y3ky,Elzedhaitch,fully agree people don t seem to understand its not that the young are not getting the virus it s the virus are not affecting them as much so they get mild symptoms but you still can spread it to your parents grandparents who are more vulnerable if your family has more vulnerable people you have a responsibility to ensure they do not get infected not saying volunteering is not good but sometimes you have more than you to consider
g1qtcr,horsetrich,nice
g1qtcr,DarthAesder,can someone explain why you can t wear the straps inside
g3nnbm,GlompSpark,lets say you go out to buy food or whatever but the other party cannot hear you clearly through the mask are you allowed to lower your mask temporarily to tell them what your order is reading all these instant 300 fine news articles is making me paranoid
g3nnbm,roxasventus210392,i mean that would defeat the purpose of wearing a mask
g3nnbm,zenqian,no
g3nnbm,skybobobear,raise your voice
g3nnbm,rowgw,no but some people still do that though
g3nnbm,FitCranberry,try not to
g3nnbm,Sporeboss,please don t do that virus have no symptoms you can t confirm you don t have the virus please use hand gesture
g3nnbm,Aspirant2,yes did this in large font to a stall staff when she couldn t understand what i was saying
g3nnbm,GlompSpark,there is a big difference between lowering your mask for a few seconds so the other party can hear you and not wearing the mask for several hours while outside then you think we should not be allowed to take off the mask while using the basin in the washroom too
g3nnbm,sunhoanalwarts,so you rather expose the other party then bear with a few secs of public humiliation my dear nobody can recognise you with the mask on don t care just do what you need
g3nnbm,the4got10-1,you really think you should be able to take off your mask right when you are going to spew out the most amount of saliva
g291dh,SoulXVII,i m not asthmatic and don t have any actual breathing difficulties i m just curious
g291dh,Jammy_buttons2,yes if they go out so don t got out if you can lor
g291dh,thattragedy,i m not sure how it works but if wearing a mask affects your breathing then its best not to go out and risk losing 300
g291dh,thewind21,i am asthmatic i have always be sure to have an n95 around me during the haze yes it s difficult to breathe but it s still better than not breathing dead just find masks that are most comfortable i have air and other masks that are more comfortable than standard 8910
g291dh,-_af_-,1 high risk group should avoid going out 2 high risk group should do everything they can to reduce the risk 3 if it is so difficult to wear please dont go out
g291dh,FindingADeveloper,yes either don t go out or wear a mask
g291dh,fool168,haha if u have asthma or breathing problems ur chance of being a severe covid case is much higher still dunwan to wear mask very brave i salute u
g291dh,Luc3Dio,all the more you should be wearing one take care and don t go out unless necessary
g291dh,tatabusa,everyone except those jogging and toddlers under 2 years old must wear a mask outside their house
g291dh,vas_26x,yes cos they have a compromised respiratory system
g291dh,linusgrey,not sure about that perhaps if they can t get or pass the covid 19 bug they can don t wear that s the point no i suppose if someone really had that much breathing difficulties they should already be staying at home so not trying to be unsympathetic
g291dh,tom-slacker,asthma doesn t render a person immune to coronavirus
g291dh,detectivesher,get a doctor s letter saying that you have asthma just in case you need to go out and not able to wear mask
g28qux,lafietafie,doesn t it beat the point of wearing a mask in the first place why didn t the government ban smokers in the public pretty unhygienic too as some of them dump their butts on the floor after smoking which also have traces of saliva
g28qux,10000owls,bro you just found a niche case for a startup develop a mask where you can attach a cigarette to the intake filter and expel air through a mini chimney like snorkel you can use darth vader or bane as inspirations for what the mask ought to look like
g28qux,zenzoka,they ll obey sure if you instill enough fear in them but according to the same logic all other unhygienic practices and vices should be banned too remove public bins and allow people to only throw rubbish at home alcohol and junk food should only be consumed at home eliminate prostitution gay men forced to go through routine medical checkups people with hep abc banned from eating in public and the list goes on is that the utopia you re looking for
g28qux,thattragedy,there are videos of people altering their mask to smoke or eat maybe they can try that hahaha
g28qux,bilbolaggings,maybe someone should make a smoker mask that has a velcro cloth flap
g28qux,ChinaWine_official,by that logic if risk of infection is your justification then govt should ban exercise in public too lots of people run and sweat and saliva drip all over the place when they do and they don t wear masks in fact the smoker is better than the runner at least the smoker has to stand in one spot all i have to do is avoid smoking corners the runners will leave their bodily fluids across the whole neighbourhood
g28qux,Oscarizxc,you re on the next level of stupidity lol what about your used tissue paper that you keep dumping
g28qux,BreakWindow,i prefer that they smoke downstairs instead of at their window beside mine
g28qux,players02,what do you propose then
g28qux,Kopi0Kosong,are they coughing from smoking or covid
g28qux,ceddya,or just be considerate and don t litter
