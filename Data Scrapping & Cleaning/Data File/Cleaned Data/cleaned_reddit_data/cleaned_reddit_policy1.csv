g0a102,nlim2004,not a bad idea to deter people to be honest
g0a102,CSlv,that 40bn needs to come from somewhere
g0a102,helloween123,install erp at the lifts and stairs so that no one will go out for fun
g0a102,exprtcar,this is actually quite funny
g0a102,Zekro25,imagine if they implement this in the us
g0a102,Shoki81,not bad everyone confirm guai guai stay home lol
g0a102,pranlee,what a solid idea
g0a102,ArmedSweeping,when it becomes 8888 cases can i telll the officer that i saving the money for his wedding angpao s
g0a102,Alberqueque,that s a unique way deterring people a more pragmatic solution and it hits home to people the consequences of their actions
g0a102,YnwaMquc2k19,genius solution imo
g0a102,Luinithil,should implement that in malaysia our police are still arresting anywhere between 700 1k idjits a day who can t sit still at home it seems
g0a102,sneakpeek_bot,1 0 2 source code https github com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github com fterh sneakpeek
g0a102,saoupla,how about a of your income set to a minimum amount number of covid19 cases
g0a102,madmaxwong,nice better still link this to all those that are tested and suspected cases and there will not be any social distancing problem
g0a102,k4tagaki,make them pay for the cost of treatment for those who are in the hospitals and care facilities now
g0a102,muahcheeee,the fine should be more than the free money the gov is giving us
g0a102,MrFantasticallyNerdy,your reading comprehension fail is it my original comment was to address that it s unfair to charge only 300 and it should be pegged to income ability to better deter infractions notice i didn t say income in 2020 but 2019 this is in reference to the comic s suggestion to peg the fine at some semi arbitrary number of the covid 19 cases then you come in with a sarcastic diatribe about asymptomatic carriers and professions in critical services and i explained that we re like minded about taking this seriously and you replied with some illogical statement about me lecturing you smh
g0a102,hackenclaw,and take 75 of that fine give to front line workers
g0a102,beetlemagnet,not for the first hundred or so would be like a early bird discount to them 0
g0a102,NonObservantObserver,this is why they let the fw dorm cluster happen s
g0a102,houganger,at this pace govt will probably break even
g0a102,AizenSousuke92,hold it right there satan
g0a102,SamBellFromSarang,probably the only one that is a creative and b has some form of comedic timing and punchline
g0a102,CassiopeiaPlays,they would clear up their national debt within no time if they actually enforce it like us but half of the average citizens will just end up in jail since they can t pay their fines
g0a102,Redundantusefulness,police officer will confirm say you can give me the angpao now
g0a102,Luc3Dio,that s a great idea
g0a102,colddeadplace,no need your lecture thanks wtf lol you started the discussion and you re rage quitting because you re feeling lectured
g0a102,CharlieJuliet,ya so sue me
g0a102,kel007,the first few hundreds already got warning instead of fines x
g0a102,sgtransitevolution,incorrect after doing a few quick maths 40 billion dollars divided by 5 7 million population is about 7000 dollars worth of fine if everybody in singapore got fined once and then twice it is still not enough to cover that 40 billion
g0a102,heil_to_trump,the problem being that the us s national debt is mainly made up from bonds they issue and the vast majority of debt is actually owned to itself
g0a102,benechobox,yes but if more people got fined means more people are going out which lead to more people get infected leading to more cases which means fine amount would increase
g0a102,TetraThiaFulvalene,are you saying the singapore government can t write enough fines
g0a102,chooxy,actually you should use the sum of arithmetic sequence if the fine increase by 1 each time you ll just need 282 843 to hit 40bn in fines n 1 n 2 40 000 222 746
g0a102,HalfALawn,so it lead to the us threatening to crash the us economy right

fz3iwn,roxasventus210392,inb4 repeat offenders complain that the fines are too expensive because they got no income
fz3iwn,redditomega,thats why we can t expect the entire population to be treated like a reasonable adult
fz3iwn,Klubeht,didn t someone suggest predict this in an earlier thread we always make fun of the govt for making us a fine city but the truth is we as citizens always get the govt we deserve
fz3iwn,tryingmydarnest,oh good no income can stay at home or serve jail time in lieu of fines all 3 meals paid for save money
fz3iwn,Exofanjongdae,and that s how our govt manage to get back the money given out during the 3 budgets
fz3iwn,FeefaPlayer,seriously bruh human race is under threat from an epidemic and you are saying you can t sacrifice your habit to exercise outdoors if you don t know indoors exercises there are tons on the web to help you get through and those indoor exercises are no joke it can rip you as equally good as the outdoors ones
fz3iwn,AriesAscending,if you run fast enough
fz3iwn,worldcitizensg,good one at last
fz3iwn,300maan,ikr easy
fz3iwn,mrbearishungry2018,i know the need to obey all the rules but there are just too many new rules coming out in these few days i am quite worried that elderly people who do not have access to news may not be able to adapt to the new rules so fast and get fined how do they identity properly who are the real ones who can fine them and who are the scammers on street
fz3iwn,balvenie25,next time lead with that
fz3iwn,CoordinatedOak,pls tell your parents and grandparents to stay at home don t get fined for nothing
fz3iwn,madrackwp,thanks for clarifying
fz3iwn,4xisTW,before this got damn lot of covidiots stubborn dont want abide cb rules coz they not scared of warning now that the government step up i guess situation should be better
fz3iwn,IPAisGod,nah just their gahmen bro
fz3iwn,syanda,pakchik pekchek liao
fz3iwn,raymmm,no income then government just take away the 300 from your solidarity payment lorh
fz3iwn,RemiFlanScarlet,are you fucking dumb lol edit fuck me you re 34 years old and can t differentiate between essential workers and people who decide to go out and loiter for no reason without safe distancing
fz3iwn,HolIowed,ayy you re the first person ever to wish me my cake day in 3 years thank you very much 3
fz3iwn,Jammy_buttons2,give the companies not the workers
fz3iwn,greenery14,to be fair many european countries are enforcing lockdowns with fines and judging by the number of people who were out in my corner of cambridge today because it s the hottest weekend since last summer i m all in favour of it just shows it s not a singaporean thing
fz3iwn,csf09,govt here s 300 but if you go out with your friends you give me back the 300
fz3iwn,firelitother,some people don t want to give up their outdoor exercise privilege
fz3iwn,nicktanisok,then after awhile you have to swim fast
fz3iwn,tom-slacker,going by the number of people that fail 2 4km ippt no they don t run fast enough
fz3iwn,Calikura,the only ones who need to constantly play catch up with the rules are those who are constantly walking on the edge those who keep themselves well within the safe zone don t even need to bother following the news tbh the only thing that s being changed is that what we can or can t do is becoming more and more explicitly defined because a small minority of bad eggs are basing their decision making not on whether it benefits society or not but on whether it is legal or illegal
fz3iwn,danrosli,the reason for raising the alarm gradually was literally so that people have time to adapt and that when greater measures are imposed i e now there shouldn t have been a need for heavy enforcement because it is an expected progression and it s not like the govt has been trivialising the severity of the spread or that they ve continued encouraging people to meet each other visit densely populated areas etc ever since the second wave came in mid march they ve already signalled companies to have their employees work from home wherever possible prepared parents for the possibility eventuality of their children having lessons online and implemented many other distancing measures sure some would argue that these measures should ve been better enforced instead of it just being voluntary but had those measures been adhered to diligently i d think that we wouldn t need to get to this point you re also assuming that such problems of non compliance wouldn t have occurred if we had raised the dorscon and had implemented a lockdown from the beginning i can t bear to imagine the throngs of people rushing to ntuc ikea toys r us etc just before the lockdown and the sheer number of people losing their jobs income unnecessarily because companies wouldn t have had the time to figure out appropriate action plans blaming the government for not locking down the country earlier also insinuates that most if not all residents are too stupid and dumb to proactively carry these measures out on their own and before you attack me for being some pro govt pap dog i can also be critical of the govt if their actions warrant criticisms for example the current situation at the dormitories was absolutely avoidable like whose idea was it to house hundreds of thousands of workers in confined spaces without thinking that if just one person has the virus it s game over for the place and why is it that this issue never crossed the minds of anybody in the taskforce before it had to come to this so you see there are many other aspects of the govt s response to the virus that one can be critical of but blaming the govt for residents non compliance of the measures is just a bit too far fetched to me
fz3iwn,AidilAfham42,the rule simply stated to stay home unless your life depends on it
fz3iwn,usherer,and it s not as if singapore doesn t have one of the worst income divides in the world weve also seen the hundreds thousands of people who have been stood down or have lost their jobs this is very worrying indeed
fz3iwn,StoenerSG,i hear you but hor let them downvote lor lor wahahaha what s gonna happen i still sleep soundly at nite
fz3iwn,smalldog257,allowed places were originally parks and public paths but now it s green and open spaces managed by the government so jogging around the neighbourhood is no longer ok but exercising in other open spaces is allowed of course the government is free to close access wherever it likes but you d be breaking the law by trespassing rather than contravening the covid regulations the required safe distance is 1 metre no matter whether you re exercising or not
fz3iwn,vanillakopi,where do you get your news bro alex tan
fz3iwn,localinfluenza,giving 50 bucks a day to singapore companies to house their malaysians employees for two weeks
fz3iwn,realestatedeveloper,yeah get those poors out of sg oh wait who will clean your toilets do your maid work and do construction work
fz3iwn,h____,these are also the people who will be first in the line to use the available medical facilities before the others who are more prudent and considerate
fz3iwn,irrateed,look on the bright side they can t do anymore harm if they re dead right
fz3iwn,ohcrap333,happy cake day
fz3iwn,lipsumtml,happy cake day
fz3iwn,Blurkillerex,it s like the escooter all over again regulations not enough just outright ban lor
fz3iwn,UnfairHelicopter,i d blame it on the government downplaying everything and trying to to raise the alarm bit by bit it will take time for people to adapt what s wrong with dorscon red and initiating a lockdown at the start we just love to blame the citizens here the government is never at fault
fz3iwn,CeilingTowel,fair mah
fz3iwn,SgDino,this if u stick by this can t go wrong
fz3iwn,pendelhaven,no wor still got many needs to jog wor like no jog will die like that no jogging is more serious than keeping the virus in check ok
fz3iwn,-LifeOnHardMode-,the closing of the recreational places is part of the gov s efforts to mitigate the spread of covid it is not at the discretion of the relevant park authorities
fz3iwn,ChoiceScarfMienfoo,no longer allowing takeout
fz3iwn,jerms__,plus wear mask and 10m apart
fz3iwn,Laui_2000,i feel like some people just can t stand staying at home people who don t regularly exercise are using exercise as an excuse to step outside their homes and hogging all the public spaces i like to go for a jog around my estate and since the measures were implemented all the running routes have 2 3 times as many people entire families are exercising together even some parents are bringing their kids outside i m not sure if this is them being dumb or insensitive anyway i ll try to do my part by exercising at night or at dawn when there aren t people around failing which i ll just stay at home and workout indoors
fz3iwn,cheekia,agreed these people try to cover up their selfish wants by saying the law say can when they re definitely just toeing the line
fz3iwn,yellowtofuwarrior,they re a drain on our resources even before covid 19 the faster they go the better it is for the country
fz3iwn,Adingding90,the problem is that they ll do quite a bit of harm before they die
fz3iwn,CheekyWanker007,sg gahmen dont play around which i like i give u chance but u want to cb me then i cb u back
fz3iwn,exprtcar,i suppose it would be fair to say that the rules for caregiving have changed but for the other situations i don t see any change in rules the closing or beaches and park areas is not a change in rules but the discretion of the relevant park authority
fz3iwn,howappalling,try going before sunrise fresh air few to no one and you may be able to catch the sunrise before you head home
fz3iwn,fibbermeister,dumb i vote dumb
fz3iwn,Sputniki,no no no you re forgetting the narrative that the government is an overbearing patriarchial tyrant

fzozqe,snowysnowy,i think it s referring to the hobby of rearing songbirds and there are parks that owners can hoist their birds in cages up high
fzozqe,sonastyinc,that beach only has like 5 meters of sand
fzozqe,roxasventus210392,great
fzozqe,avocado_milkshake,i know and i agree but i was curious as to the legality of it only
fzozqe,sticheln,is using bicycle for getting necessities okay by the current law
fzozqe,X1yWe4YQx59g,serious q the covid 19 temporary measures act of 2020 aka circuit breaker legislation says that one of the allowed reasons to leave your home is d to engage in any recreational activity in an open air stadium public path or public park alone or with any other individual who lives with the firstmentioned individual https www moh gov sg docs librariesprovider5 pressroom press releases annex for notification 8 apr 2020 pdf doesn t this explicitly allow flying a kite or playing frisbee as long as you re doing it only with people you live with and keep a safe distance away from anybody else
fzozqe,yang17,good
fzozqe,HalcyoNighT,whoa ccb 250 x 300 is already a small fortune
fzozqe,jieqint,the national parks board nparks shared that they have closed more than 720 playgrounds and fitness corners to allow for safe distancing and prevent gatherings in groups

fzozqe,wookyusho,they got spare to donate to gov
fzozqe,CalmTheAvocadoDown,national parks stated that all social group recreational activities such as picnics fishing group exercise etc are not permitted before you argue they might be doing all those activities alone you can fish alone too and that is prohibited so bird singing and kite flying is ok i doubt so and tbh do we really need a specific rule telling us not to play outside during this pandemic
fzozqe,EmpDK,why do people like to wait til laws are being enforced then they wake up their ideas and especially in tough times like this when we should bite tight together to go through this period if we were to compare with other countries that were being locked down allowing people to exercise is already a privilege and now we have people trying to test the system social responsibility is the keyword my friend
fzozqe,WalfAkaiTsuki,stay the fuck home you retards
fzozqe,FeefaPlayer,i am not that surprised at this news even in this sub reddit there are already people thumbing down others for encouraging social distancing so you can take this mentality sample from this sub and extrapolate it to the real life
fzozqe,smalldog257,errant visitors were found exercising kite flying frisbee playing bird singing entering areas that had been closed aren t we supposed to be going to parks to exercise and isn t frisbee playing a good form of exercise as long as it s with family members
fzozqe,BruHYS,went here 30 years ago how far has sg progressed as a fine city now let me relek now as i enjoy my retirement elsewhere
fzozqe,lurkinglurkerwholurk,by the looks of things in the news the ability to ignore laws in order to look out for the number one is a first world mentality too
fzozqe,captmomo,i feel it s cos majority has this sense of exceptionalism like it won t happen to me kinda thinking as another poster said when the virus claims another victim no one really cares https www reddit com r singapore comments fyiuvd case_1604_who_tested_positive_for_covid19_after fn2oufy we can t seem to make the connection between our irresponsible behavior and the outcome the death of case xxx is just something we gloss over rather than taking the time to pause and reflect on our own behavior and reaction to this pandemic
fzozqe,JakeAndRay,so you say this and it s fine i said this a couple days back and got called sheltered
fzozqe,FitCranberry,never been a fan of this distinction the system is made and used by the people there is no difference between the two
fzozqe,moshumaiike,i saw one family flying kite in an open field between bishan and toa payoh this one unprecedented
fzozqe,jeemchan,but don t touch your face
fzozqe,Calikura,there always are at the open areas at ecp popular spots would be angsana green and the concrete steps in front of the bougainvillea garden marina barrage as well but that s not a beach
fzozqe,cigsandbooze,i think now before stepping out of the house people just need to ask themselves one question is this essential
fzozqe,hanlk,kite flying is not allowed but asking someone to do so is allowed
fzozqe,rossriley,why do the police have a different set of laws maybe they work off channel news asia
fzozqe,Spaiduhz,if you go alone i don t see why not
fzozqe,Nerac74,remember to wear mask
fzozqe,capnbullseye,why would anyone feel the need to fly a kite or play frisbee just because the legislation says you can doesn t mean you have to it s very simple stay home save lives
fzozqe,SometimesFlyHigh,they probably the same people who yell govt give u 1 drumstick they take back 1 whole etc
fzozqe,dodgethis_sg,had been closed you missed this part
fzozqe,wildurbanyogi,some may be due to over zealous enforcement or instructions not clear also whether to stick to the letter or to the spirit of the rules this is like the no eating in rule enforcement that pushed f b workers to dine in toilets
fzozqe,Jammy_buttons2,https www nparks gov sg noticeboard https www nparks gov sg noticeboard
fzozqe,Yamaguchi_Mr,agreed i don t see the harm in doing so as long as it with family that you live with in a public park which appearss to be in line with what the current law is
fzozqe,deepfriedceleron,227 951 members of which at least 4 000 people are online now not everyone here has the same opinion
fzozqe,Vedor,why you so salty
fzozqe,revolusi29,embrace the downvotes
fzozqe,sangrilla,now that most people don t have to work or work from home they suddenly have a lot of time to do things they usually don t have time for not a good time to pick up an outdoor hobby though
fzozqe,aloy99,the phrasing seems to suggest that entering areas that had been closed is a separate action from exercising that led to fines warnings it could just be mothership s wording though
fzozqe,Hastalawakbar,says who
fzozqe,CheekyWanker007,im pretty sure there are people doing exercise with friends which kinda defeats the purpose so the gahmen decided if u want to bend the rules then they just stop everyone completely lo
fzozqe,darklajid,i would say the very first word errant as in errant visitors disagrees with your interpretation i read it as they all were somewhere they should not be doing x y or z
fzozqe,evilkim,no idea where angsana green is but pretty sure flying kites is not allowed at the bougainvila garden
fzozqe,quietobserver1,this is a stressful time for people already if they are able to do their desired recreational activities without breaking safe distancing guidelines then why not i think the real issue here is that there is inconsistency in what is considered ok and what is considered not ok with the govt tending to want to err on the side of too much to cover all the bases and on the other side individual people making their own judgments based on the sometimes vague guidelines
fzozqe,firelitother,i agree i initially wanted to do some solitary photography but i am afraid if it s not exempted from the rules
fzozqe,bellaella,i tell you what if you think it s okay to play football fly a kite go fishing or play a frisbee at east coast park go ahead tell me when and what time and i ll file a report then you can go argue with the enforcement officers and police about it to prove whatever point you re trying to make

g2479z,breadcatfps,hahhahah my first thought too
g2479z,zeroX14,its not so much about money talks in sg but the court jail process is an utter waste of tax payers money for small offences like this there are already existing cases piling up to be cleared at the courts and its actually quite expensive to run a prison
g2479z,gnoserif22,i was just kidding but ok

g2wq91,Nje1987,fine employers 1k but if the workers break the rules they get their work permit rescinded seems proportional
g2wq91,Lopn4sive,again what s the purpose of social distancing wouldn t the nature of their work make all these redundant
g2wq91,Flocculencio,the saf doesn t own buses but still indents them to transport troops to and from exercise areas because they re safer and faster than shoving everyone into a tonner like they used to back in my day yes it will be another expense for the construction companies but we ve consistently seen that prioritizing profit over people just leads to worse situations if a company die die cannot profit without treating workers like livestock then it should fail

g2wq91,mydslrjourneys,individuals are fine 300 for practicing social distancing i recommend a fine of 300 x number of workers they try to squeeze on each lorry
g2wq91,ongcs,pay enough sure there will be bus companies want this business key is construction companies not like saf they are for profit we are in a society that is for profit simple as that
g2wq91,justasmallkid,a base of 1k
g2wq91,goldenpisces,there might be other factors for example maybe bus rental companies aren t willing to transport them i don t think they shower change to clean cloth on site before leaving for dorms
g2wq91,weedandpot,actually it s interesting that you say prioritizing profit over people leads to worse situation i just listened to a podcast by planet money on the economic value of a person s life while most people will say life is precious and priceless there actually is an economic value to a person s life i don t know what the numbers are or how you would get to calculating them but all companies consistently weigh the economic value of a person s life to its policies for example i know many companies buy ergonomic chairs which cost 1 5k onwards for their staff do you really think it s for their welfare it s more because the 1 5k spent over the lifetime of the chair can result in less back issues for workers which means better productivity and lesser medical claims

g0io4g,Skythewood,no passengers have been fined at roadblocks for not complying with these measures the article seems really specific though
g0io4g,honey_102b,the key element is fear escalation
g0io4g,The9isback,that s because the passenger doesn t have a license the person with the license is responsible in the case of social distancing everyone is responsible
g0io4g,-_af_-,the same reason if your passenger never wear seatbelt the driver kena fined on the other hand can they skirt the definition with the offender being summoned technically they were fined they are only fined when they get it in the mail

g13r08,Invalesco_POE,of course there are certain things the govt has done which could have been improved however the situation has evolved everyone knows that masks are helpful in preventing infections however how useful are they we didn t have any statistics back then and still don t to prove exactly how effective they would be in preventing covid and if it would be significant enough a preventive measure to possibly risk shortage of supply if everyone panic bought some of the initial advice was still correct that washing hands properly and practising proper hygiene is more effective in preventing covid infections because it is if people panic bought masks and we ran out of masks for healthcare workers it would have been disastrous if we ended up having healthcare clusters a shortage of healthcare workers due to quarantine and an overburdened healthcare system as a result given that the past week has seen a surge of cases there is probably now a worry that we would exceed our bed capacity if this continues given also that our supply of masks has now improved compared with feb mar if you balance the risks and benefits again it probably makes sense to change the initial advice and to ensure singaporeans wear masks and take maximum precautions even now doctors in some departments still have our masks rationed and are limited to 1 mask per day to prevent overconsumption

g13r08,pinkguyfriedrice,nah they were indecisive rules changing every other day means they can only see 2 days ahead too much pride to admit their initial call was wrong
g13r08,IPAisGod,agreed but when you look up the term nanny state in the dictionary you see the flag of singapore

g13r08,SPQRRome,bdsm fantasies too
g13r08,8125def,apparently they did not learn from what happened to china then to europe and the us taiwan were fast enough to implement measures and now they are the safest place in asia you can see how policies remain stagnant in feb and now they are changing every 2 days the virus gives no fuck to indecisiveness and arrogance
g13r08,Vooshka,medical staff wore masks as they are exposed to sick people giving them a higher change of contracting the disease due to proximity and exposure to increased viral loads
g13r08,jurongbirdparksg,yep as late as the beginning of april https www straitstimes com singapore health coronavirus benefits of mask use among healthy people topic of debate in singapore doctors were divided on whether to implement mandatory mask wearing even dr paul tambyah from sdp noted that the evidence on routes of transmission and the efficacy of homemade reusable masks was still hazy
g13r08,duckington92,don t worry once they approach you and you start running away from them you re exercising again
g13r08,XYTB,the reusable masks tore so easily when i tried to wear them uhh i don t think my face is that big
g13r08,FriedCuttleFish,agreed at least have the decency to wear it correctly if wearing n95 mask don t wear it half fuck way
g13r08,OneRollingTomato,for the reusable mask they gave i don t think it s possible leh made of cloth sia my father was saying he felt it was hard to breathe wearing that and cycling
g13r08,maeverickmind,i actually don t get all the rage about the decisions gov been making or calling them indecisive the way i see it you monitor situations you adjust and update rules as the situation changes what works for other countries in early stages such as compulsory mask wearing may not necessarily work for us esp knowing what kind of pattern singaporeans are like so it does now then update the rules we wear masks then just wear lah this is unprecedented and for something like this i feel that there s a lot of preparedness already on the their end you can t possibly predict and prepare everything that s not how life works
g13r08,The9isback,like i said that part of the science is not necessarily definitive and definitely not newly developed in the last week having a half assed week 1 of cb just to change the mask policy into week 2 is asinine if they had made it mandatory from day 1 i m sure more people would have gone to collect their masks sooner instead of waiting during the week
g13r08,fibbermeister,it s important to bear in mind that you cannot treat a massive group of people like an individual
g13r08,A-Chicken,actually the govt told people not to wear masks unless they were sick that s because of a shortage and the fact that scalpers were trying to make buck on masks of questionable source and quality also this was advice from the who its head was the source of the wear masks only when you re sick advice i mean there s plenty of similar controversies surrounding him too
g13r08,UnfairHelicopter,when in doubt err on the side of caution just wear the masks
g13r08,HElovesF1,look i have the same thoughts you can look through my post history i was questioning if we were getting complacent back in early mid march when us and europe went into lockdowns while we are still carrying on life as usual and the lax shn measures too what i m saying is we can say what we want about the past but there is no point because we have to look ahead and anticipate the next move

g13r08,acekingspade,reminds of the whole pmd saga how they changed the regulations so people had to buy new pmds and then banned them not long after
g13r08,whitetigertrainer,police not wearing mask get over here
g13r08,HuDragon,i really admire the hongkongers they have a joker ccp bootlicking government that gives zero fuck about the people so they ve adapted and learn to survive through collective social responsibility
g13r08,PmMeYourNoobz,the singapore sme way
g13r08,windiven,no whatever country that the chief of who likes does not undermine the research done by the scientists there there is no benefit to be gained by the who for sabotaging the entire world with false research whether people wear masks or not doesn t affect the economy only the decision to lockdown does but either way containing the virus is the best way to help the economy it is not a dichotomy of either economy or public health the ministers were doing what they can to maintain some semblance of normalcy when the virus was still pretty contained because stopping the economy is going to harm the vulnerable who doesn t have much savings the most it is a legitimate tradeoff and tough balance to strike it is not an issue of face or greed in wanting to keep the economy going you think accumulating 5 million reusable masks is easy when every other country in the world is trying to hoard masks for themselves telling people to wear masks when not having enough reusable masks to distribute will cause an acute shortage
g13r08,Xstreamly99,i tot that s more of gen z haha
g13r08,giidi,we are both now we were too slow and have lost control hence overreacting
g13r08,PMmePunnyJokes,yes hang it at door put it on with shoes always unless you are under 2
g13r08,imhotunderthesun,depends if there is a crowd outside
g13r08,han5henman,not random testing but accessible testing i think using per capita testing as a guide isn t very accurate while korea s per capita numbers are lower than singapores their outbreak was centered around daegu a city with 2 5 million people now i cannot find figures to show how many of their 500 000 tests were carried out in daegu but even if we assume only 10 of those 500 000 tests happened in daegu they ve got singapore beat per capita and keep in mind that more than 50 of koreas cases came from daegu so 10 is probably low anyways at the end of the day i m just some guy stuck at home only one country has got their covid numbers under control since having a sruge and we would be foolish to not follow in their footsteps
g13r08,PavanJ,where aside from social media were people being shamed for wearing a mask edit i ask a question and i get downvotes
g13r08,DancingHeroEatYouUp,during exercise when lots of sweat is absorbed by a surgical mask it will be very hard to breathe unless you loosen it i m guessing thats why they allow no mask during exercising for the free reusable masks though i m not sure just read your edit you do have a point imo give it a few days and exercise will probably be not allowed
g13r08,Bearswithjetpacks,for one i think the task force in charge of dealing with this pandemic needs to be transparent with citizens and announce potential measures and actions they re considering for the coming months and educate citizens on the rationale behind major changes we could rip into the mistakes already made and point fingers but all that does is allow us ti vent frustrations what is upsetting now is that there is no indication that the people deciding the fates of the lives of many singaporeans have any clear idea what they plan to do no timeline no direction stricter measures would have made a world of difference earlier we re beyond that and i d like to know now what contingencies are being implemented and are there still more does the authority behind this have a plan for recovery for the long term and can the citizens be informed of their role does singapore have a plan masks weren t the issue the lack of foresight and leadership the lack of social responsibility and etiquette and unity these are the issues this turned into a rant more than anything so i ll stop myself here i think what could have been an opportunity to present singapore as a competent and attractive model to follow has and is still being wasted and it s embarrassing and infuriating
g13r08,AyysforOuus,it s really hard to breath especially when you re excersising
g13r08,nlim2004,not everyone had masks or a sufficent supply by then they announced it when everyone was already given the chance to collect reusable masks first it s not about them not being able to make up their minds it s about them ensuring that everyone has been given the chance already been given the masks or were told to collect so they no longer have the excuse that they do not have masks so they aren t fined unfairly because of them not having enough masks edit added last clause
g13r08,boysachok,can t always pleased people when early2 implement people will ask what for no need laaa when got a lot of cases already people will ask now then want to implement etc2

g13r08,deangsana,given that we still have so many people pushing boundaries of the circuit breaker and even breaking the rules at this point i think if we went lockdown earlier it would be even worse in terms of compliance as the fear factor of contagion would have been less

g13r08,sonastyinc,https edition cnn com 2020 01 31 health coronavirus asymptomatic spread study index html https www nejm org doi full 10 1056 nejmc2001468 query featured_home
g13r08,ash322,i can validate your point
g13r08,Kopi0Kosong,i think the government was wrong to say in the beginning that people shouldn t wear a mask they were basically shaming people that were voluntarily wearing a mask that was wrong of them they should ve let people that were wearing a mask wear one of course the advisory itself to only wear one of sick was following who
g13r08,AtreiaDesigns,the best part is the people who are compaining about these changes are also the ones who are stubbornly acting and causing these changes to come aboutn
g13r08,H3nt4iB0i96,i think most of the studies both before and during this pandemic that i find indicate that masks are largely ineffective at preventing a healthy wearer from catching the virus when taken alone but the nuance is that there appears to be evidence to suggest that it may be quite effective at preventing spread if an infected person uses them since this prevents some of the release of droplets into the air this was what informed the initial stance on masks but what i think they failed to recognise was that a asymptomatic spread was possible and quite common meaning that you may be able to spread the virus even when you don t show any clear symptoms and b infected people with mild symptoms might not heed the warning to use face masks a caveat to a here is that whether or not masks can prevent asymptomatic spread still hasn t been established however i think there s an extremely high likelihood of this being the case and it s really really better to be safe than sorry also the main reason why this was enacted only just now was because the government had just finished giving out its masks so they can justify policy like this
g13r08,DuePomegranate,that s a ridiculously small study and it actually shows that cloth masks are more effective than surgical masks viral load is measured on log scale so when patient 1 wore the cloth mask and reduced the viral load from 3 53 to 2 27 log copies ml that was a 10 1 26 18 2 fold reduction and patient 3 reduced the viral load by 12 6 fold surely reducing the viral load that you are spewing out by 10 20 fold is important
g13r08,tehtf,they aren t able to keep up the supply with the demand no gov intervention on export nationalized and ration mask production mask gouging shoot up the roof ppl are hoarding arbitrary selling masks and create a country panic
g13r08,stiggz83,and yet we are still in this position shows the flaws in their actions
g13r08,Brisrascal,diy waterboarding
g13r08,_krypton99,but walking back home even tho it s a short distance like 100m still need wear mask right
g13r08,forkboot,i ll probably be doing some vertical running walking in a few days
g13r08,MadKyaw,well they certainly don t wear surgical reusable masks
g13r08,zeroX26,that s not how hypoxic training works you need to change the o2 concentration seriously
g13r08,dontknowwhattodoat18,little did they know that the altitude mask gives minimal to no change at all to your training
g13r08,lanyingjie,35 or 39 i was 39 we had to do the mask runs regularly
g13r08,pendelhaven,you dunno meh asking people to stop running for a few weeks due to a pandemic is like killing their family like that running get covid nvm but no run will die
g13r08,raspberrih,i heard go up ok go down is bad for knees
g13r08,Eskipony,i think if the cases in our migrant worker community weren t exploding our cb measures would be ignored by a large part of the population
g13r08,StuStuffedBunny,yea but they could ve also announced that free mask giveaway but as soon as this is done masks will be a requirement it definitely feels indecisive

g13r08,kopipeng,cdc recommends any cloth face coverings to protect and help to slow the spread of covid 19 https www cdc gov coronavirus 2019 ncov prevent getting sick diy cloth face coverings html this advice did not exist up until april because scientific research based on cases at that time suggest that asymptomatic transmission is unlikely of course with more cases means researchers have new and more data to work with which results in a different advice that does not mean the initial mask advice is wrong it is just no longer valid with new scientific evidence it s part of science if you didn t know up until april we did not have a reusable mask stockpile because if we did the g would have released that instead of surgical masks which have far more utility for healthcare workers compared to the general public the rationale behind the mask advice has never changed from the start mask up to protect others from catching the virus not yourself surgical masks cannot protect you from catching the virus because the water droplets can land in your eye or enter through your ear which is why healthcare workers wear full ppe initially mask up if you are sick because if you have symptoms you may have the virus since asymptomatic transmission was unlikely based on evidence at that time now mask up all the time because you may unknowingly carry and transmit the virus because asymptomatic transmission is highly likely based on evidence at this time yeah so like aiya no asymptomatic study to prove then nvm la let them cough in the air hand and touch here and there right use common sense la bodoh i feel lucky that you re probably no where in the public service because if there were people like you who justify everything on arbitiary common sense which might as well be irrational feelings our system would have been crippled decision making especially at the national level has to be evidence based with consideration for your current realities and weighing tradeoffs not to mention without name calling just to prove your point
g13r08,ybct,that time china closed factories cos of cny then couldn t reopen cos of virus so surgical mask shortage globally want to buy for how much also don t have the more you say people should wear when it is impossible to get the more they will panic and there was no proof fabric masks helped which was why we did not have a stockpile of fabric masks to give out now we are desperate and surgical masks are still in short supply coupled with new research that says it s better than nothing so it took time to procure the few million fabric masks the govt was giving out again no point saying people should have it when people cannot get it all you will achieve is mass panic and then people will start hoarding everything else
g13r08,fallingstarrs,likely singapore s ppe production would not be done locally due to land space higher wages etc and set up overseas then you come back to the issue of countries blocking exports of masks ppe for their own national interests like what happened with taiwan and what the us is doing globally

g13r08,jangwookop,this it s easy to say everyone should wear masks early on with the benefit of hindsight
g13r08,junnies,you can always calibrate policy and recommendations to what is feasible explain that due to limited supply of masks we need to ration it for medical staff and frontline staff retail phv medical etc who interact with many people in crowded places encourage or even mandate mask wearing for those who are most likely to be super spreaders due to their social interactions or those in close contact to confirmed or suspected cases implement and practice social distancing so that community spread is minimal etc etc it doesn t have to be all or nothing of either healthy no need wear mask or all must wear masks or be fined
g13r08,localinfluenza,u wear mask during the initial period ppl will ask u why u wear mask u sick ah
g13r08,RawOnionRings,it was back in feb and during peak hours on the mrt and mrt was packed load of people so this auntie just moved away from me and shifted to somewhere with group of people not wearing masks and doesn t look sick to her it caused those people in the cabin to turn heads and stare at me like i did something wrong or like i m really sick which i m not i also had one time when i sat down with a mask during off peak hours on the mrt beside an uncle this uncle turned and stared at me before getting up and moving to sit beside someone without mask and once again those people in the cabin stared at me wondering what had happened

g13r08,Revalent,i m not disagreeing with you in the aspect that we should be looking into what we can do next you are right however my point is that for that particular point hindsight can not be a valid excuse
g13r08,isparavanje,would you prefer random testing there are limited tests even with mass testing no country has enough pcr machines to test the whole population like you re envisioning so symptoms and close contact is used as a guide everywhere including korea

g0voy1,spartacurse,education thing then no need to take photos lah are they that daft do good things must post on the media social media meh
g0voy1,FatAsian3,should just fine him as well if you want to go walkabout just send your people out and do the delivery to the hawkers and go off doing a photo op just makes it look worse
g0voy1,blackreplica,this comment will probably get downvoted but having a 70 overall mandate and being an mp in an impenetrable grc like tanjong pagar will explain a lot of this sort of behavior
g0voy1,jmzyn,so col chua was tagging along like a bodyguard this backfired so badly
g0voy1,orneryman,the st headline said it was a walkabout but st never get pofmaed so does that mean it was a walkabout but then the mp say it wasn t a walkabout i m very confused
g0voy1,oofmewho,he s walking about chatting with hawkers with a group of people and even inviting the press if that isn t a walkabout i don t know what is
g0voy1,redwithin,really tone deaf and reeks of privilege even if you have the most altruistic motives surely he should recognise that no one else would be allowed to do this
g0voy1,bilbolaggings,totally justifiable i completely believe their words s also i like how they have to mention he helped out with some food distribution programme for more pr recovery points
g0voy1,threedrops,lol
g0voy1,septeal,well if it was wp it would be a whole diff narative
g0voy1,PhantomWolf83,same as always one set of rules for the ruling party and their elite ilk another set of rules for the lesser mortals
g0voy1,aaronthro222,not mentioned in article he s 1 orthopaedic surgeon at sgh 2 chairman government parliamentary committee for health so i guess he knows more than us peasants who are doing stupid things like following rules and respecting laws
g0voy1,aiyopa,wayang king to the max
g0voy1,alterise,enough excuses just fine him already i m sure he can take it
g0voy1,troublesome58,lame excuse hope he kanna covid
g0voy1,TheOrbOfAgamotto,if i do the same later at the hawker near my place will i get into trouble
g0voy1,letterboxmind,we were not doing a walkabout we were there to tell people to wear masks when serving and please wear masks it was more an education thing was he appointed an sgclean ambassador is he an enforcement officer with nea nparks or mom if the answer is no then stay at home edit to clarify dr chia should state on what authority is he going around to distribute masks and doing public education 1 as a private citizen then i d say no because cb is in force 2 as an mp then my question is whether the collective agreement for all pap mps is that it s okay to walk around their constituencies to visit essential services
g0voy1,mildfull,ok help me find photographer also can no need same household one
g0voy1,udunjibai,lan cheow la cheow wey number one
g0voy1,SlaySlavery,double fucking standard seems like an mp with high education doesn t understand simple instructions too
g0voy1,thattragedy,so its okay if they walk in a group but if we do it its illegal lah are the other 5 men living with him
g0voy1,sangrilla,the question isn t if this is a walkabout or an education walk the questions are 1 does his group belong to the social distancing ambassadors 2 is he and that colonel chua living in the same household 3 is educating the public a good reason for breaking the circuit breaker 3 is especially important if it is then i m going to ask my gf to go with me to the park to educate park goers on social distancing and wearing of face mask this guy is so desperate to be selected to represent pap in the ward that he think everyone is an idiot would be nice to see what masagos has to say about his colleague
g0voy1,coffeeteaormeh,oh wow he s an actual doctor from sgh

g0voy1,Thorberry,lol at straits times implicitly rebutting him by calling it a walkabout in the headline did not expect that from them of all publications
g0voy1,tenbre,what kind of crap response is this somebody please make a police report on this guy
g0voy1,azniamocking84,laws for thee but not for me
g0voy1,Twrd4321,the straits times should just be renamed the pap times notice how charitable the headline is to him
g0voy1,theronzz,we were not doing a walkabout we were there to tell people to wear masks when serving and please wear masks it was more an education thing are there hawkers that are still going maskless during this period of time the ones i ve seen are all wearing their own masks
g0voy1,engrng,it s ridiculous that not owning up to mistakes is so pervasive throughout the entire government and of all people to do something like this it is a highly educated medical practitioner absolutely mind blowing
g0voy1,AidilAfham42,this bullshit motherfucker will set off a chain of if he can why i cannot
g0voy1,Jammy_buttons2,the guy who is a doctor is an idiot and should be fined or at least given a written warning
g0voy1,StopAt2,so eating bak ku teh on day 0 not ok but walkabout with 200 cases ok
g0voy1,shian243,if it isn t then why pap feel the need to stop all walkabouts
g0voy1,NotSiaoOn,nah govt already say no more warning this is the perfect guy to fine to send a strong message across
g0voy1,lazerspewpew86,i sincerely hope this retarded stunt costs him votes he clearly puts his votes ahead of his constituents health
g0voy1,Galactiva_Phantom,a person who is of pure heart to help will focus on the helping part and care less to be pictured in his act of helping people getting recognized for doing so its the happiness of the people they helped that they cared about not whether they got been rewarded for what they did the fact that all these politicians poses and written a lengthy posts all by themselves on their own social media tell you quite simply what they wanted was the publicity and the act of kindness was just a by product
g0voy1,TinkerAndThinker,they should be fine fined
g0voy1,random_thoughts_guy,someone should also do an education walk see if he she gets gets fined
g0voy1,300maan,she cannot wash the indian away from her blood tho
g0voy1,bardsmanship,oh for pete s sake i thought they declared all grassroots engagements and outreach suspended just to make things clear i didn t seriously believe any mps would be daft enough to still be doing walkabouts but you learn something new everyday
g0voy1,skbong,if you are warning issue fine to ppl for loitering you really need to practice what you preach cause everyone can have a cock and bull story on why they need to be outside
g0voy1,zeratul123x,uniquely pap
g0voy1,Takemypennies,we were not doing a walkabout we were there to tell people to wear masks when serving and please wear masks it was more an education thing we re not imposing dorscon red this is just a circuit breaker

fz72tq,baxoga,delivering essential goods or services line is targeted towards those who do it as a job ie grabfood people etc govt has clearly stated that if you do not have a job in essential services you should not leave your house except for essential services takeaway food buy grocery medical services etc for yourself or solitary or with household member exercise this is from the perspective of strictly following the law and spirit of the circuit breaker measures if you really wanna exploit some grey areas maybe you can sign up to be a deliveryman or something or if their family members still have the same address on their ic this is also a potential exploitable loophole even if this is done it is strongly recommended that contactless delivery is done since he is given 5 day shn mc due to flu like symptoms but in doing so you would have done non essential commuting against the spirit of the circuit breaker measures possibly exposing yourself to contracting covid19 if someone on the public transport were to have it

g1naqm,sneakpeek_bot,the need is stronger for someone else singaporeans dip into government payouts to help others hit by covid 19 outbreak singapore like many singaporeans freelancer sophia sim has been hit hard by the covid 19 pandemic with her gigs having dried up ms sim who works in the film industry is living on her savings and help from the temporary relief fund the one off s 600 payout from the government disbursed as part of the solidarity budget on tuesday apr 14 will also tide her over the difficult time advertisement advertisement when i received news that there would a payout i felt quite grateful because i m in the arts industry in the film industry we are quite badly affected she told cna i was very grateful it would definitely sustain me for a bit however ms sim believes there are some out there that require more help such as singapore s migrant workers and hopes to contribute a portion of her payout towards this cause advertisement advertisement the need is stronger for someone else the amount is significant to me but it is even more significant to others ms sim explained i hope it wouldn t seem like i m making a big sacrifice or contribution i personally think it s only a small thing i can do to perhaps alleviate a much bigger issue the s 600 payout was announced as part of the solidarity budget which aims to help firms workers and households amid a worsening pandemic that has affected many sectors in singapore nine in 10 singaporeans will receive it said the ministry of finance deputy prime minister heng swee keat had urged those who can to donate the payouts to charities on the giving sg website or the community chest s courage fund or to directly share it with others not everyone will need these cash payouts i am very encouraged that many have written to me my ministerial colleagues and mps that they do not need the cash payouts and suggest that we give these to those who need the cash more i thank fellow singaporeans for your thoughtfulness said mr heng who is also finance minister it s about fulfilling basic human needs ms sim is not alone in her desire to help others using her payout a give asia fundraiser titled give your solidarity payment to break cycles of inequality wegiveinsolidarity has seen more than s 67 000 raised from about 450 contributors as of 11 30am on wednesday the fundraiser hopes to benefit five organisations and help them to support vulnerable groups these organisations include charities such as boys town humanitarian organisation for migration economics home red cross women s rights group aware as well as hagar an organisation that helps women and children account manager nicholas lee donated s 300 of his payout to a red cross campaign to help the elderly on the same morning the money was credited to his bank account i m lucky that my job is stable enough in this period when i received notice of this sum i wanted to donate it all away but i wanted to find the right cause said the 27 year old mr lee hopes to use the remaining s 300 to help other causes close to his heart such as children in low income families what made me want to help out the elderly and kids who are in need is because their basic needs cannot be fulfilled he said for the elderly it s having enough food to eat for kids it s being able to attend lessons having trouble doing home based learning that s why i felt very affected these are the very basic needs that we take for granted that they can t actually have civil servant esna ong is hoping to reach two groups with her payout migrant workers as well as children in need of laptops for home based learning which has been imposed on all schools throughout the circuit breaker period in this time if you have extra and you have a stable job i think it s all the more important to give to others my parents always encouraged us to give said ms ong who wants to donate her full payout ms ong has already given s 300 to the covid 19 migrant support coalition an informal group consisting of volunteers that want to help migrant workers one of its goals is to curate learning resources to help the workers in equipping themselves with new knowledge and skills sometimes its not just enough to give money without really thinking what you re giving to she said it s about having that multiplier effect and choosing a place where that multiplier effect can be stronger ms stephanie siow who works in corporate communications noted that these donations could help others for whom the payouts were insufficient this is an unprecedented crisis and a lot of these less privileged groups need a lot more help than what the government can give because the government needs to take care of everyone said ms siow who has donated her full payout to home and hagar those more privileged should give a little bit more if they can generally speaking for some lower income singaporeans or prs permanent residents the payout might not be enough for them she added for

fz5hz2,darklajid,hi i like the newest update saying that first time offenders will be fined immediately hopefully it helps but what i m unhappy about is that as far as i m aware the rules you can violate change daily are spread out over various channels like the initial gazette was easy to read now there are lots of small adaptions and i have no clue how to stay on top of them i don t want to hunt down these updates on cna or straitstimes or oh my god no facebook and puzzle if that might cost 300 dollars is there a single official concise ideally gov sg site to consult on a daily basis am i just unaware of where to find this or does this just not exist edit i was made aware of https www gov sg article what you can and cannot do during the circuit breaker period which isn t bad but too much prose i d guess a checklist is better and likely not going to be updated also doesn t mention a lot of stuff like the mrt masks etc but that s kinda what i m hoping for
fz5hz2,Tarsoup,yes i totally agree announcing a 300 dollar first time fine through facebook which is then picked up by straits times at such a late hour isn t the way i d like to find out whether i can do x anyway i bet its gonna be dorscon red level lockdown in a matter of days with the cases spiking and the fact that the new rules propping up everyday or so is difficult to enforce follow this is just the gov easing us into it
fz5hz2,bored_guy_is_bored,you can try https canigo sg its not an official website from the gov but it is being updated in a timely manner afaik it s approach is also very simple and allows people to contribute if there are missing stuff
fz5hz2,saperis,nope there isn t one everyday rules are being changed just goes to show how disjointed the agencies are now
fz5hz2,yinyangpeng,perhaps this may be of some use https www gowhere gov sg
fz5hz2,rossriley,read the legislation https sso agc gov sg it s very simple any amendments are added when passed
fz5hz2,Beyond_Hunter,follow this stay home if die die need to go out please wear a mask
fz5hz2,zelop,you can join the official gov sg telegram group https t me govsg
fz5hz2,fishballmeepok,thanks for this really explained better than the legally worded regulation i ve been taking reference to yes i now know that i can engage in recreation activities alone in an open space i was worried because the regulations specified parks paths and stadiums
fz5hz2,tehtf,not rules but some faqs for ppl that need further gov direction direction for their specific situation eg divorc e elderly concerns etc https www moh gov sg covid 19 faqs
fz5hz2,Dunkjoe,the funny thing is some one eddit have posted of photos of how some pcns are closed not sure if it s all but it s not in the news correct me if i m wrong even nparks website doesn t mention https www nparks gov sg gardens parks and nature park connector network notices the measures might be rolling out faster than the news can cover liao lolol
fz5hz2,chenhankiang,it just shows how messy the situation is
fz5hz2,ThatAndresV,i ve no evidence but i d like to think that you receive a briefing leaflet when you re served with a stayathome order and then if the rules change while your subject to it you re in contact with the gahmen on a daily basis anyway as they check you re in place
fz5hz2,redditersg,just go straight to total lockdown do what china is doing getting people to buy food
fz5hz2,UnfairHelicopter,just do the lockdown and be done with it
fz5hz2,masterdaryl,tbh if you stick by the request to stay at in your own home and don t head out unless you need to get food or medical care then you ll be fine it s those who are constantly trying to find the loopholes that ll find these almost daily new measures difficult to follow and worry about falling foul of them
fz5hz2,Peksean10,unfortunately they only seem to send the updates at around 11am
fz5hz2,10000owls,once somebody tests the system tmr and kena jialat jialat the news will spread through the bwn boomer whatsapp network
fz5hz2,FitCranberry,we re making it up as we go depending on how things are on the ground
fz5hz2,darklajid,then so far the public will look for loopholes in what can be done i heard this a lot and it might have some truth to it of course my bigger issue is with the current change stating that there will be no warnings if you re expected to violate no rules and don t get a warning which i think helps to send a sign to those that don t care then you should make it easy to see the damn rules in one simple place i understand the spirit of the law but i also see this is as a potential way to pay a fee for things that potentially were still okay yesterday again if no warnings will be issued anymore fine away for violations but be transparent and open about what s the situation is is what i m saying
fz5hz2,avocado_milkshake,best thing about this rule is that it s timeless
fz5hz2,raymondthor,i m subscribed and i don t see the new regulation to wear mask when going into supermarkets on the other hand i am reading too many comments suggesting self enforced rules no exercising outside i think op is right to raise as a concern
fz5hz2,rivervalley1,hi op i am also subscribed to the gov sg whatsapp bot and i am given to believe gov sg by its very name should be the best place to see a compilation of all the rulings issued by various agencies however you are right gov sg both the website and bot seem to be missing the latest advisories that came out today about compulsory wearing of masks on public transport wearing of masks to malls and supermarkets about the beach closures etc this suggests to me that the various agencies are coming up with these rules post haste as the situation evolves and there is no time to update gov sg website instead we need to rely on various sources like ministers fb postings reddit posts cna and st etc which i agree is kind of disorganised and scattered perhaps we can check back tomorrow or monday to see if gov sg is retroactively updated with today s snowstorm of announcements lets give gov sg a chance to get itself updated
fz5hz2,-_af_-,i do understand where you are coming from but look at it from the other point of view the government say this cannot do that cannot do then so far the public will look for loopholes in what can be done i feel that yes there should be a proper official list but this list will be too dynamic for people to keep track anyway for example the mask is required for supermarkets convenience stores pharmacies and shopping malls and public transports i bet you singaporeans will be like then go to wet market no need to wear then the next thing you know government will say wer market also need then people will complain why keep changing the rules not reasonable to keep checking the list so it is more important for people try to follow the spirit of the law to the strictest interpretation which most likely will exceed the word of the law
fz5hz2,DrinkMilkDaily,i get what you are saying today was really a zerg rush of rules being published which contradicted what the ministers earlier preach this is totally uncharacteristic of past singapore s leadership style guess we ll just have to make peace with ourselves that a full lockdown is in effect immediately rather than trying to squeeze whatever remaining time we have with the outdoors
fz5hz2,spectrearcz,i d question why you aren t wearing a mask at this point in time just wear one whenever you go out can t go wrong
fz5hz2,teenylittlebeanie,haha not gon as you to stay the hell at home but no i don t think theres a collated list of new updates to the rules it changes whenever the numbers are up or when ppl just not adhering to their rules and tries to find loopholes for me i will just bring my mask out in a ziplock bag and wear it when i have to esp when i m going into confined spaces like the mall or supermarkets even before the new rule kicked in
fz5hz2,WittyKap0,nah singaporeans are generally good and following rules and finding loopholes so this approach is really not going to work if the provided information is not crystal clear and communicated widely through all channels they can t go around enforcing it or they will face a pr backlash for poorly handling the situation especially if we are talking hundreds or thousands of especially old people who didn t get the message
fz5hz2,boisdeb,your whole argument is based on this list will be too dynamic for people to keep track anyway i strongly disagree with that it feels like you spend 0 seconds thinking about it and just wrote something that looks like a reason to support your argument it s a matter of a few lines per day stop being of bad faith saying it would be worse than nothing
g0diir,rzotten,hey i m not sure if it fits the sub but i was wonder if i could go outside with my mom for her to visit the doctor we will be going in a cab and there were some rumours spreading around that two people can t go outside together please let me know i m a bit concerned due to the 300 fine thing that has started stay safe everyone and take care
g0diir,FatAsian3,you shouldn t be stopped as long as you re both from the same household i just accompany my mom to go for her regular check up today and there isn t any thing that s saying i can t do that
g0diir,antsepea,alternatively you can google teleconsulting and video chat with a doc the medicine will be couriered to you within 2 hours quoted time but i received mine in 30mins paid 18 consult delivery fee 30 1 course of anti biotics 48 this consultation was for uti it may be more expensive than polyclinic but polyclinic is heavily subsidised its equivalent to normal private doctors or even cheaper but you don t need to step out of your house
g0diir,itoku-sg,i believe you can check out under can i still accompany my elderly parent living in a different household to medical appointments https www gov sg article what you can and cannot do during the circuit breaker period just make sure you both put on a mask each and keep a safe distance from others
g0diir,sjioldboy,can if it s for a regular medical appointment you would have received a sms notification saying in part in dorscon orange only 1 person is allowed to accompany you to the clinic you may not be seen by your usual dr team of drs persons on shn will not be allowed entry if it s only for a regular doctor consultation i e not undergoing prior clinic test the health service will also suggest via sms skipping this turn if the illness isn t too critical am going through it with both my aged parents
g0diir,Practical-Library,i have an ob appointment and the doctor made it clear that one person can accompany me when i asked so i m sure you re good as long as it s not the whole family going together besides i m pretty sure the fines are targeted toward those loitering around and don t siam when asked to
g0diir,PrimeLegacy,as long as maximum 1 companion caregiver you re good don t loiter around after you re done
g0diir,4xisTW,can two ppl go out together you must wear mask provided you live with your mum you may take her to the doctor but avoid doctor hopping
g0diir,Neptunera,can
g0diir,rzotten,wow that s actually really smart thank you
g2gsft,jinny90,according to straitstimes https www straitstimes com singapore transport carpooling now illegal after transport ministry waives exemption but largest lets say my colleagues and i just finish a meeting at some ulu place like tuas area so i can t take his car since we are heading east and have to take a cab else we will get fined 300 each
g2gsft,siranglesmith,drivers are deemed to be carpooling if they use private cars and charge for ferrying passengers
g2gsft,Hfujsmndhjd,i think walling off pay or not articles on revoked laws is a new low for straits times
g2gsft,Xanthon,forget about the law care more about your health and don t carpool 300 is nothing compared to you getting the virus and spreading it to others killing them
g2gsft,fallout1942,work harder so that u can afford to buy a car lol
g2gsft,ybct,but then below this includes non commercial carpool arrangements between people who do not live in the same residence
g2gsft,FrostSurge,sorry but wouldn t carpool with a friend that you ve already been spending majority of your day at work with way better than taking the public transport with the crowds or taking grab uber with a stranger who ve picked up other passengers beforehand
g2gsft,exprtcar,another commenter said carpooling law does not apply to you in any case i think you can as it can be deemed to be reasonably related to your work in essential services
g2gsft,isparavanje,so basically it counts if you re paying regardless of whether it s on a platform or not
g2gsft,hoeleng,this is due to circuit breaker measure no you can t be in a car with someone not having same address as u
g2gsft,-_af_-,but how is the potential risk different from taxi grab wouldn t it increase the risk since now theres one more contact
g0mbw9,backerkv,as much as i agree on the severity of the virus situation i d say a lot of it is overplayed by how people fall into the trap of only being caught up by the big numbers they fail to see the details and composites of it of course that s also my personal opinion but i m here to just discuss how we can at least be more detail oriented in outlook recently there s been a massive spike in cases but if we look deeper the majority of the hundreds of new cases are really just the dorm workers this skews the data tremendously if we re only concerned about local transmissions outside the existing clusters which going by numbers tally are well basically made up mostly of the dorms anyway say for eg 400 new cases out of which 399 cases are quarantined already vs 400 new cases out of which only 100 cases are quarantined the number is the same but how we should treat the number should not be the same it s like how people panicked when we used to get a record 70 cases even though most were imported true the imported cases can still spread into locally transmitted cases but at present we dont know the likelihood of that there s also the factor of testing how many people are actually being tested matters just look at iran and their fake numbers if we didn t test all the dorm workers the daily numbers we see would probably be much much lower and regardless these workers being quarantined should raise no difference in whether their infections are added to the daily count or not i believe because the spread should already be contained to begin with lastly there are those who have already been quarantined and just tested after that in which case them adding to the infection count shouldn t matter as much either the ones we should be concerned about are the community transmissions which are honestly still significantly small in numbers if we take away those from existing clusters the number is even smaller if im not wrong only in a few or several dozens per day again i m not saying we re being over paranoid but it s important to look at the composition of a big number than just take it as face value in that case we can gauge the severity of the spread more accurately if we ever see a day of 1000 new cases or something before you go bonkers look deeper at the numbers edit i guess downvotes are downvotes seems like readers are getting the wrong message here i m not advocating to lessening our lockdown measures or anything all i m pointing out is the possibility for daily cases to drop drastically in the future not mainly because of cb measures but drop naturally because most cases that we see at the moment are all only from pre existing clusters and dormitories that are already quarantined and far far away from the general public once the dorm infections are over the total no of cases will likely drop so basically don t go bananas when you see today s 300 new cases
g0mbw9,saperis,i feel the assessment is being too optimistic here cases will get more severe later for ventilators we have no idea how many we have it is not open information we have seen how breakdown in healthcare system has led to large increases in number of deaths including healthcare workers death which is extremely demoralising here s hoping we can avoid that
g0mbw9,skatyboy,there s no exact number in fact no country gave up on efforts despite having dorscon red like situation
g0mbw9,sjioldboy,yes the numbers spike 5 days now coincides with the aggressive case finding mass swab testing of all workers living in purpose built workplace dorms since april 9 this taskforce involving the saf spf is led by tch my concern is that moh has currently named 24 dorm construction clusters but only 8 of them are declared as isolation areas s11 dorm tampines dorm sungei tengah lodge westlite toh guan toh guan dorm cochrane lodge 1 cochrane lodge 2 acacia lodge this means that those living at the other 18 clusters as well as at the other foreign worker accommodation mom lists 43 licensed dorm operators of 1 000 beds each they ve also inspected more than 600 other factory converted dorms in the last few days aren t subject to quarantine orders unless they are identified as close contacts the 24 workers getting deported for breaking cb measures at tuas view square dorm meaning they were caught mingling outside nearby highlight the social dilemma when the entire construction sector is halted at the same time i expect more dorms to be gazetted as isolation areas in the coming week rather than doing this piecemeal perhaps shn orders should be issued to every dorm resident instead cluster or no cluster otherwise we re just dragging out stopping the spread at these hot zones
g0mbw9,AcrossTheWay23,i agree with you that the recent surge if contained within the dorms can be controlled and eventually brought down however imo the high numbers are still concerning bcos all the infected are still people as a thought experiment imagine if today s 386 cases are nsfs in tekong it would still be contained but the political fallout would be huge similarly we have to treat the fws as if they are singaporeans since they come here to work for us just my thoughts not finding issues with your points
g0mbw9,MrSinkie,fws vs singaporeans i have never mentioned anything along this line that s you it s clear you were trying to allude that things are not so bad because the growth of numbers are from fws and not locals this is clearly a destructive thinking to have right now
g0mbw9,Intentionallyabadger,what i mean is that at least with current clusters you can take the steps to contain and ensure that it doesn t spread out if you get a totally new cluster you have to throw resources to ensure that it gets contained
g0mbw9,ballsie995,huh what is dorscon red is new flavour can eat one ah you want try some pof ma ma
g0mbw9,sadcnianfv,this is why higher number of cases regardless of their nature is so scary it pushes the healthcare system closer towards being overwhelmed
g0mbw9,lupCheong,ofc not we d lose our precious who gold standard rating when it comes to dealing with wuhan
g0mbw9,pingmr,eh the fact that we are doing better than italy is of little help if our health care system is strained none of the tired nurses and doctors out there will take a deep breath and think o well at least we aren t italy and then power on better as u saperis points out however you cut the numbers each new patient consumes finite resources of medical attention contact tracing staff and so on
g0mbw9,300maan,those places where people are dropping like flies shouldn t be what we use to compare let s strive to be more like taiwan or south korea or even new zealand when dealing with this
g0mbw9,EarthwormJane,for herd immunity to work 80 of the population has to be immune best way to achieve this is by vaccines because without vaccines 80 of our population will mean that about 4 million people gets infected there s no way we can deal with that effectively if we just let the virus run its course
g0mbw9,redditme789,do you reckon that ll happen given the unlikelihood of a vaccine coming out anytime soon like eventually things will settle majority of people get infected and transition into that phase
g0mbw9,Arcturion,if we can already contain the clusters existing here then future infections may drop drastically and just as easily if we fail to contain clusters here future infections could explode drastically it s way too optimistic to assume we will have enough hospital beds in the future and the danger of downplaying the scarily high infectious rates now is that people may get complacent and relax their safeguards which will guarantee that explosion there are already too many people not taking the cb seriously
fzv63h,DingLeiGorFei,just dropped by giant to get some groceries to cook for dinner i pulled my mask down to re adjust it because my breath was fogging up my glasses employee immediately told me it was illegal not to wear a mask now and i ll get 300 dollars fine this was echo d by the aunties and cashier employees around there were people around looking confused hearing this i ve never heard of it and quick google found no official news about it i checked cna and gov sg https gov sg too told this to my group chat and my friends said they received the same treatment for not wearing mask in sheng siong similar lines were repeated by sheng siong employees too this is very conflicting to what my friend who works in early childcare field said they disallow wearing of mask in the centers unless you re on health screening duty am i out of touch or should i be pofma ing the aunties i support wearing mask and i do wear one but spreading fake news like that is not the way there are elderly patrons and patrons who do not have the luxury of access to internet whatsapp telegram instant news and they will believe them granted this is not a bad thing to believe in
fzv63h,IssitOeL,i was just denied entry into 7 11 for not wearing a mask
fzv63h,shroodlepoodle,it s announced by gov sg at least that s what i saw from my telegram not sure where you checked supermarket staffs are legally allowed to refuse you entry it s not fake news
fzv63h,thattragedy,i think fine is only for those who kena caught by authorities who ignore cb rules but not sure if can apply it to establishments but establishments have the right to deny entry if no mask is worn as for the aunty or anyone in future just tell her your glasses is foggy i sometimes pull mine down cos the mask gahmen gave too tight for my facial feature
fzv63h,csf09,oh yeah true my bad if they aren t wearing masks i don t think they ll get fined they just won t be allowed to enter the store
fzv63h,300maan,denied by the mixed veg rice store owner lol claims that nea will fine you if you don t it s fine i just went back to get my mask
fzv63h,khaosdd,they are aunties and uncles the very same ppl who believes drinking garlic water and eating curry leaves will cure u of covid19 u must understand majority of such ppl prefer to listen to their friends more than read official sources and when someone say orh hor u will get fined if you don t do so and so it sensationalise and catches ppl attention more than reading up on a 6 page regulations book on the many confusing rules that are constantly changing every day for the past few days so 1 person spread to 10 10 to 100 100 to 10 000 you end up believing it yourself because everyone else is saying the same thing plus since it s so impactful nobody wants to get fined people responsible for their own premises like sheng shiong employees at sheng shiong will use it even more to get ppl to abide not to mention singapore is also a fine country to most if u don t follow the rules u get fined again with such a confusing set of measures being constantly updated nobody knows what is what so ppl just assume everything will eventually lead to a fine to be clear you will be fined immediately with no warning from today 12th april onwards if u break any of the cb measures listed in the first link of the article https www straitstimes com singapore 300 fine for flouting measures as far as i can tell wearing a mask is not yet part of the measure that when broken will lead to a fine however if u subscribe to the govt whatsapp or tele group today s 12th april post does tell you that supermarkets convienience stores and pharmacies have the right to refuse you entry https i imgur com bjkhc2y jpg
fzv63h,Boogie_p0p,https www straitstimes com singapore coronavirus all shoppers must wear masks in supermarkets and malls or be denied entry literally the first hit when i google wear mask supermarket it s not the law but they reserve the legal rights to reject you if you don t
fzv63h,The_Guileless_One,check out the covid 19 control orders on agc singapore statutes online it should provide you with up to date regulations that have the force of law last i checked doesn t seem to say wearing a mask is mandatory
fzv63h,rancidangel,are you triggered because the auntie scolded you
fzv63h,Doubleyoujay,angsty lol
fzv63h,DingLeiGorFei,that doesn t change the context of my reply and i know what he meant i was wearing a mask i pulled it down below my nose to adjust my glasses first before pulling my mask up
fzv63h,IPAisGod,i went to one this afternoon with no mask no probs
fzv63h,runebound2,they are conflating two pieces of news that s why as of yesterday https www straitstimes com singapore coronavirus no more warnings 300 fine for first time offenders of circuit breaker measures the govt announced that there would be no more warnings but first offender of the circuit breaker measures will be immediately fined 300 that is what i think they are talking about keep in mind that there has been enforcement of mask wearing in markets unsure if compulsory mask wearing is now part of circuit break measures
fzv63h,Fellinlovewithawhore,its not a crime but they can deny you entry if you still insist then its trespassing which is criminal
fzv63h,pingmr,coffee shops super markets etc are ultimately private property and the owner can deny you entry for any reason including a wrong understanding that wearing a mask is mandated by law they re wrong about the law bit but they can totally deny your entry
g0koux,progymnasmata,living in a flatshare with 2 flatmates who are in relationships one left at the beginning of the cb to live at the boyfriend s house the other girl has her bf to sleep over almost every single night she never has fully asked me if it was ok and truthfully i don t mind all too much from a risk perspective all young adult expats but it really is the fact that they seem to have no sense of social responsibility that really grates at me they were out clubbing etc on the nights prior to cb going into effect and ok yes i am a bit concerned for me i know the obvious answer is to just be direct but i am concerned she won t handle it well even prior to this cb he is over a lot and i think she will flip out when i put my foot down and i obviously don t want to live with someone moody and resentful at me for the next month for being the fun police i m just trying to stay healthy and help society flatten the curve how have people dealt with these kinds of conversations absent being a snitch and reporting them directly what s the best way of getting the message across or do i just snitch after i politely tell them of course edit when i approached the flatmate today she said she thought it was ok for visitors and made the assumption that if the bf wasn t staying the bf could visit to which i said hell no the surprise turn is that she said well in that case she wants to move out ostensibly to find a flat with her bf i don t know how that will actually pan out during this period but she prioritized living with and being able to see her bf over general public health and safety confirmed covidiot i am not even certain of how she is going to move out at this point luckily i think she just resents the situation and not me and luckily i m in a stable financial position where i am ok to lose a flatmate and gain unfettered peace of mind for the next few months until i can start searching again thanks much for the talking points reddit
g0koux,Black-footed_Cat,communicate your unhappiness over the whole situation frame it in a non blaming manner bring up the legislation draconian as it is which is pretty clear now inform them what you intend to do the bf has been over everyday so that s done get him to consider whether 1 he wants to stay at your friend s flat or 2 stay at his house if he chooses 1 then he should not be leaving your friend s flat for any other purpose except under the regulations if he flouts it then you re reporting him technically the bf doesn t have a choice and has to live at his place of registered residence but it shows you are taking their relationship into account as well alternatively just communicate your unhappiness and request him to stay his registered place of residence if not you are snitching
g0koux,crazydoctor674,to answer the titlr yes you are living with cbs during cb great combo there mate
g0koux,pendelhaven,report them anonymously get them fined then inform mom get their work pass revoked
g0koux,nokman013,if there is even a modicum of friendship in your relationship you should not snitch even anonymously just tell her upfront ask whether the bf wants to stay or not since there is the latest advisory regarding registered homes this should be a no brainer for them and it will at least show that you considered the possibility no matter how slim it is
g0koux,troublesome58,snitches get stitches
g0koux,falkner98,personally i have a few question to ask before making a decision to snitch or tell her 1 does the bf drive over or take public transport if drive over it greatly reduce the chance of getting covid 2 does the bf wfh or part of the essential service if wfh again it greatly reduce the chance of getting covid 3 does the bf have other families which is part of the essential service living in his house these question will let you know how big the risk is for the bf to come over for sleep over almost every day tbh if he is wfh and driving over personally i would be fine with it however if he is having huge contact with stranger and coming over everyday i would suggest you talk to your flatmate or just snitch them anonymously also you can ask your flatmate if its possible she stay over at her bf place instead of him always coming over if you want ultimately its all up to you to choose which is the better choice because its your safety we can only suggest what you can do
g0koux,pumpkinsee,do they know they could get a 10 000 fine and or 6 months jail for a first offence i was trying unsuccessfully to talk my housemate out of going to visit someone until it turned out that he didn t know about the penalties he thought he d be let off with a warning https www todayonline com singapore covid 19 proposed law prohibit parties or gatherings any size home or public spaces gan
g0koux,TemasekLion,just pretend to cough and sniff without mask whenever they are around tell them your fever hasn t been going down since last monday that should help
g0koux,theblahking11,go for a walk downstairs and after coming back tell room mate that someone is the lift was asking about your bf and why he comes every night during cb period if they stop good if they dont just snitch
g0koux,Bcpjw,maybe i would be passive aggressive to the bf spray disinfectant everytime i see him wear a mask when he s around and when hearing him coming shout wash your hands lol on a serious note protecting yourself is also protecting them start by leaving a msg an email reminding your flat mate it s dangerous to move around love this intervention tho https www instagram com p b ukbpqhcpr igshid sawwqb2i7h1w
g0koux,hullabaloov,technically you are a covidiot too for not reporting this to authorities you know her bf is coming over every night even after circuit breaker
g0koux,JustSomeRand0mGuy,that will only happen if someone baotoh lor
g0koux,Puppywanton,you could just invite her boyfriend to stay over for the rest of the lockdown if you want a diplomatic solution to that problem
g0koux,Plus65Knight,pls snitch
g0koux,haikallp,this i agree this is the most diplomatic way to solve
g0koux,ldsg43,100 agree also if someone didn t get the message by now there is a good chance they ll continue being stupid it s a criminal offense to violate current regulation and every guest in the country should be a leading example or simply has no right to be part of sg society
g0koux,harekrishnahareram,agreed with this in fact if she still doesn t listen threaten her with snitching and explain the repercussions it is illegal at the moment to meet anyone
g0koux,progymnasmata,lol she decided to move out because i didn t want to support them staying together in my house and she couldn t bear being apart from him sigh let bygones be bygones
g0koux,chooxy,could be but the most suspicious would still be the person who sees them the most unless they re so suay to get spotted by neighbours frequently enough to spur them into reporting especially during this period when much fewer people are heading out
g0koux,julia1707,good to hear you just talked to her sad she left but hopefully you will feel safer now be safe and healthy
g0koux,samglit,finding someone else to pay the rent at this time would be a bit tough i d think
g0koux,zyrapenguin,it s not up to the op it is literally against the law under the current cb law this is a criminal offence that has been committed multiple times and is ongoing
g0koux,imbeyoncealwayss,if you feel the need to threaten to snitch reconsider your own moral stop going onto the internet and worry for other people you need help
g0koux,ThePunnet,you ve got the law on your side on this one i don t think society as a whole will blame you for doing the right thing their behaviour also speaks for their social groups perhaps and that s how it turns into a cluster don t be afraid to stand firm
g0koux,jwyh1994,eh not really could be the neighbours
g0koux,PureSmoulder,never take advice on how to handle disagreements from reddit
g0koux,Movingskyclub,if he contributed to the rent as part of the temporary move in deal would that make you happier it could simply be a matter of economics if you agree to him being over since now you are sacrificing the share of the space that you paid for
g0koux,Darkblade48,girl one went to stay with the bf actually i think this is technically not allowed moh says that you have to stay at your place of residence which is typically indicated on the ic no if the police go to the bf s place and check everyone s ic they ll see the gf is not registered there and can fine her
g0koux,potatomaster420,just say the bf is the child and op is the grandparent

g0evcm,Bryannnnnnnnnnnnnnn,warning this is going to be a long rant about grabfood and din tai fung nex on behalf of my father who is a grabfood delivery driver because i was so angry and upset about the events that transpired today when he told me about it the details are recounted by him and may be biased to his experience but it does not discount the veracity of whatever happened also note this is in no way targetted at the regular employees working at the restaurant who were undoubtedly overworked as well rather someone in the higher management has to take some responsibility and provide compensation to the drivers riders and customers update my father informed me when i finished writing this that he received a small goodwill amount as compensation from grab however i will still be posting this as i feel that this will provide good insights into the workings of the food delivery industry and hopefully restaurants and customers will be able to empathise with riders drivers as demand for food delivery has substantially increased and not unfairly subject them to long waiting times or blame them for long waiting times respectively the background my dad who is almost 60 has been driving for grabfood since last week as his income for phv is no longer sustainable this afternoon he went on his usual lunch shift and got his first 3 stacked orders from din tai fung nex at around 11 30am and went to the restaurant to collect the food when he arrived there were already 7 8 delivery riders who were mumbling and complaining that they had been waiting for more than 20 30 mins and that no orders had been served yet the problem as more and more riders arrived it quickly became apparent that the restaurant was still very slow in handing out food to the riders drivers worse it seemed that the restaurant was prioritising orders for customers who were ordering on the spot and this led to more delivery drivers being stacked at the main entrance although all of them were wearing mask and observing social distancing it was still difficult to fit all of them into proper distancing because at one point there was almost 30 riders waiting at the entrance note most of the riders had 2 3 stacked orders meaning that there was possibly 60 90 orders that were unfulfilled at the restaurant by now the restaurant communicated to riders that orders would take upwards of 30 mins but refused to commit to a time frame as there were too many orders coming in making it hard for riders who had to respond to customers calling to ask when their food would arrive furthermore it was clear that the restaurant was struggling to cope as the restaurant had an open concept my dad could see the workers inside and it was clear that it was less than the usual capacity my father would later learn that the the outlet had a promo going on and was puzzled as to why they had so little workers even when demand was bound to increase with the promo going on further problems by the one hour mark it was clear to the restaurant and riders that the orders were not going to be resolved anytime soon with the orders coming out 1 every 3 4 mins and with over 20 riders still waiting many riders became frustrated as this was the lunch time peak hour and staying at the restaurant only meant they could not take up other jobs so some decided to cancel it was even worse for other riders who had collected other orders but not the ones at din tai fung so those orders would have turned cold as my dad could speak chinese and had already collected another order he went to check on the remaining orders and was horrified to learn that those orders had been cancelled but the delivery status on the app remained a few minutes ago they were still saying they were still making albeit the long waiting times in other words the restaurant was verbally telling delivery drivers and only if you went up to ask them that some of the orders would be cancelled and that they would call the customers later my dad told me that some other riders who did not speak chinese were completely clueless as to what was going on and had to rely on nearby chatters to figure out the problem they would only announce all the mass cancellations nearly 1 5 hour after the first order and even then the app still showed the delivery status as pending however as the restaurant side had not formally cancelled these orders the customers were unable to see the cancellation and the burden fell on the delivery man to deliver the bad news so you can quite imagine the results my father had to explain to a customer that it was not his fault when it was implied he should not have taken a stacked order in order to maximise earnings and instead deliver just one order when he had no idea of the situation at din tai fung until he reached the restaurant if he had knew i doubt he would have taken it as well since the orders came together simply put there was no way he could have avoided this and once he was there he could only have cancelled the job affecting his rating and earnings or waited it out and with all these going on there was already lots of back and forth with the riders and grab support staff who only stopped the orders coming in after an hour of waiting time mind you the riders already told grab to stop the orders more than half an hour ago where grab s response was only to call the restaurant resulting in more unnecessary back and forth conclusion in the end my dad could only deliver one order as the other 2 were cancelled although he was later compensated for the trip and given a small goodwill amount he wasted nearly 2 5 hours in this situation having even to go to grab hq since he could not get through to grab support staff to troubleshoot as he could not take new orders with the old ones still pending as the restaurant had not formally cancelled them yet this meant that he spent his entire lunch shift earning only that amount where his usual income would be at least twice more if he had taken other jobs and this is not even accounting for parking or other expenses in other words my dad earned barely enough for the 2 5 hours and i really teared to learn he was just standing around and running around like a mad dog trying to resolve the issue with the restaurant and having to call the customers to smooth it over with them as well i don t understand why it is my dad s responsibility to inform customers about the cancellation even if the customers were nice and understanding there was bound to be some tension and frustration when anyone learns their food is not going to arrive after 1 5 hours learning point this incident has really made me more appreciative of delivery drivers and i m making it a point to tip at least a dollar to all of them in the future i m hoping most of you could as well knowing that they could have very well went through what my father went through i also appeal to the public to be understanding of delivery riders drivers due to the current covid 19 situation as many of them are former phv or taxi drivers who are in their old age with various medical conditions if you are a merchant who has come up with a promo or promo code please be responsible enough to hire enough workers when you expect the demand to increase and not just blindly insist on cost cutting measures if you are a customer who is waiting unreasonably long for your food do check the app to see where the problem lies and if the food is still at the merchant please understand that the riders are every bit as frustrated as you are and perhaps even more than you are since their income is dependent on the trips they make every minute spent waiting for your food means every minute less they could be out there taking another delivery job affecting their overall earnings also if you are applying promo codes or ordering food on promotion please also understand that some of the merchants may be unable to cope and that your food may take longer than usual if you want to save on your cost it is only expected that the delivery time would be more as there will be more orders coming in let s all be empathetic enough to each other and be more gracious in these trying times my dad who despite going through all this is still thankful that he has some earnings to cover his rental and petrol taking home maybe 10 20 nett every day he doesn t feel that anyone should be blamed and that he was perhaps just unfortunate to be in this situation i m proud of him and all our delivery drivers still working and we can all certainly be more appreciative towards them instead of putting them down when your food doesn t arrive or turns cold even if it is not their fault
g0evcm,MrDabianz,i was one of them there at around that time can confirm it was a shit show i reach there one of the other riders told me might wait 30mins was planning to wait it out cuz no choice but luckily i got another order from burger king so i decided to do that first and then come back later and 30mins later i was back my order was done dk how long ago and all went well and coincidentally im pretty sure i saw someone with 3 orders when i looked at his screen for a second but forgot the face alr but then can someone tell me how to get compensation from grab for future reference what am i suppose to screenshot to prove i waited for 30min and who am i going to send the screenshot to also the compensation is around how much if anyone knows
g0evcm,ballsie995,customer pov should be the riders are on your side they are working for you do the physical queuing for you not just the delivery most riders are very nice like ask for sauce or special things they do it too if the restaurant forget there are some things that are legit riders fault like if the food was dropped smashed spilled most of the time i am fine because i dont expect too much from dabao food but confirm there are karens sorry idk the local version who are picky with it or even complain food not served hot well my mum is one of them only missing item or uncooked food i will complain to grab anyway customers can also help the situation by flattening the curve order eat at off peak timing do pre orders not exactly sure how they work for op case merchants can be really shitty too and i think very likely they do not bare much of the cost or opportunity cost to the whole issue i dont think the fault lies with grab
g0evcm,maolyx,hmm seems like they need to familiarize with the app cos i think they have the options to stop accepting orders through the apps have restaurants near my house showing unavailable for delivery now during rainy days too when they are usually open hope they work this out soon
g0evcm,yeeez1,you should really try food delivery for a couple days cos you really don t seem to understand what it s really like psychological effect yes i agree but would you rather i as the rider tell the customer the restaurant has decided to prioritize walk ins over your order so be prepared to wait over an hour for your food or would you rather tell the walk in customer sorry we re preparing food in the sequence we receive orders and there s lots of delivery orders ahead of yours which if you re a sensible wait staff you would ve already told the walk in customer before they started ordering unless you want the customer to be angry at you later yes every single restaurant is jammed during peak hours trust me you can ask any rider and they ll tell you 90 of merchants make you wait during peak hours and yes if there s really that many people ordering dtf i could cancel one dtf order and the next order that jumps out is another dtf order once again ask any rider no the customer cannot cancel the order once a rider has accepted it no the rider also cannot cancel the order for the customer the only people who can do that is the hotline and if a shitshow like this is going on you can be guaranteed the hotline will be slammed no one s gonna get through without ridiculous wait times so the order can t get cancelled i can inform the customer all right but they can t cancel i can t cancel then what the customer can order the another meal yea sure but the rider can t cancel so he can t move on to another job y know that s lost income and self cancellations affect our eligibility for incentives and self cancellations just result in the order being assigned to another rider who ll repeat the cycle once again ask any rider while there sure aren t any procedural issues stopping us from cancelling the order on our end would you as an employee be willing to take a pay cut because someone else fucked up i bet not same logic here restaurant messed up by taking more than they could handle so why should i as the rider risk losing my incentive because the restaurant messed up it s not a false dilemma when you re actually put in the situation of deciding whether to cancel and move to the next order to get 20 bucks or lose an incentive worth over 50 once again ask any rider you re entitled to your opinion here but what you ve said indicates your obvious lack of awareness and knowledge to what a food delivery rider s job is like if you don t know what our side of the story is like don t make assumptions on what we can or cannot do sure you don t need to be an expert so that s why there re riders here like me and others to tell people what it s like from our perspective
g0evcm,66queenofhell66,they used to have a tele chat like one on one rider to helpline but ever since the covid they removed it so now you ll have to call in or use the beta chat on the grab app itself which tbh its quite bad
g0evcm,pohleroid,ordered from dtf nex today and the order took forever tipped the delivery uncle 10 due to the heavy rain but in the midst of collecting and thanking me he mumbled something about how shitty dtf is reading this makes me feel even more fucking glad i tipped him
g0evcm,ChrisInsanity,nah it s all right to avoid constant long wait time from a vendor the wait times must be reasonable since the delivery gus has to answer to both company and customer also if he feels like if the order will take a very long waiting time after reconfirming with the shop staff he can try calling grabfood hotline requesting for further actions
g0evcm,alpacian,grab has really got to put more resources into customer service during this period both delivery riders drivers and consumers i still see them as profiteering by increasing delivery and platform fees
g0evcm,Gibbo236,wife and myself have been ordering grab quite frequently for some time be nice to these delivery guys it s not easy for them too especially since they are taking a risk by going to malls hawker centres to collect your food just a few things we as customers or users of the app can do stop hounding the helpline asking why is your food taking so long why is your food cold etc i d imagine that more often than not it is out of the delivery rider s control we have a little stool outside our condo unit for them to put the food on so w don t have to make human contact also tipped all my deliveries 1 3 bucks not much i know send a thank you message when the rider is on the way
g0evcm,Harmoniinus,not sure if the store was too busy to temporarily close the status of the store delivery when there was already so much i remembered last time at my work unlike foodpanda and deliveroo the grabfood app doesn t allow the store to reject orders unless you close the menu or store hours also glitch sometimes happen we have closed the fp delivery status before and even shutdown the phone to our surprise a deliveryrider appeared and on his phone it showed that the order was accepted switch on the phone to confirm and it did appear though it was not our fault felt really bad when we had to tell him about the glitch and that the food item was also sold out already the order was also quite a sum from what i remember it was sad to see the weak smile the deliveryman gave after hearing us i hope that things will get better for both sides the staff who have to monitor the delivery and the deliveryman who are collecting the orders
g0evcm,randomIncarnation,this feels like it can be a technical fix all orders not fulfilled by the restaurant within 40 mins should be automatically cancelled
g0evcm,Quish_,this is an unfortunate situation and i feel bad for your dad appreciate him doing his best to work at this tough period kudos to him circling back i agree with your point that everyone has some responsibility here customers should try to be more patient and appreciative of what these delivery riders are doing for them albeit at a cost fee grab probably takes the most blame because of the poor management and how stingy they are when it comes to compensation as well as support for this entire process compensation is well and good but 4 for waits upwards of 2hrs that s pathetic just to put things into perspective but foodpanda has managed this much better whenever a certain store hit a ceiling of orders foodpanda automatically flags the shop as closed to stop taking orders this way restaurants are not swamped with orders whilst customers still get their food in a reasonable time this is the way it should be done learn from them grab restaurants benefit of doubt that they have no idea how much demand their promotions will cause resulting in manpower shortage no excuses though to be understaffed and not communication to the riders earlier
g0evcm,sageadam,did not expect myself to tear up reading this this read is a good reminder for myself that many of us are having a much harder time right now and we should be more understanding towards each other workers on the ground always face the blunt impact of poor planning
g0evcm,bbfasiaolang,i knew that all this is a shitshow you could call it teething implementation issues a lot of the direct delivery also like this but yeah need some feature to set an upper limit on orders man
g0evcm,pickingpotatoes,the same thing happened to my dad as well he went to collect food at this restaurant but ended up waiting over an hour along with other grabfood drivers he also mentioned that the restaurant prioritises dine in customers to the point that people finished their meal and left and he still hasnt gotten his delivery food its kinda irresponsible and selfish cuz ur wasting peoples time and now with this shitty income u cant earn much a day if ur not gonna entertain deliveries just dont register ur restaurant on grabfood please
g0evcm,desmuru,tbh i m not surprised about this at all dtf is under royal t and honestly speaking the company has some serious management issues i used to work at liho during my school holidays and even back then without the circuit breaker things have already been quite messy anyway from what i can tell as well most outlets under the company are being overworked and are paid peanuts for their hardwork quite sad really to see that this is how employees are treated especially during this chaotic period
g0evcm,Cat1832,that sucks i m sorry your dad had to go through that delivery drivers always work super hard and i m so grateful they re still out there doing their thing during this time it s quite understandable that things will take longer time during this lockdown and i always try to at least be polite and kind to delivery drivers when they bring my stuff and not complain if things take a while or food isn t hot i have a microwave for a reason there isn t much else i can do but hopefully that s something
g0evcm,Permanent_Secretary,bloody grab and the merchant management issues leaving the customers pissed and delivery people out to be hung dry i commented a little https www reddit com r singapore comments bl96ob psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for emmoatv utm_source share utm_medium web2x about their stupid practices a while ago can t say i m surprised such issues are happening there need to be stronger regulations for such platforms to ensure that any merchants with them must be able to show that they have the capability to fulfil the orders before they take them with you in solidarity op anyone with half a brain cell should know better than to blame delivery riders for this mess
g0evcm,r3lvalleyy,workers at the restaurant looked pretty helpless and had no idea what to do i don t blame them understaffed having to deal with both takeaway and delivery orders im fucking possible
g0evcm,Thruthrutrain,sorry to hear about what happened to your dad i will take your suggestion to tip deliveryman too when i do order it
g0evcm,frumperino,which of the delivery companies do you find are the most ethical both towards the drivers and the kitchens
g0evcm,hongsy,from u yeeez1 once you arrive at the mall tap arrived at restaurant then do not leave the mall once you pick up the order tap collect order after you complete your order call in to support or live chat them tell them you want to claim long waiting compensation for restaurant name you can do this at the end of the day no rush to do it immediately after completing that order if the time between the 2 taps is 30min 4 60min 6
g0evcm,wooo_hoooo07,this was why i stopped grabfood and started doing foodpanda
g0evcm,fallout1942,in short can t wait just cancel and pray u don t kena long merchant forgo the incentive if can t wait
g0evcm,Meirux,really sorry if i informed wrongly i just think it s the same as deliveroo
g0evcm,chesterqw,bao toh the boss
g0evcm,pwnzorzz1,was a customer today ordered from jem my rider took 2 hours to fulfill the order felt really bad sigh feels like dtf management should have done something to prevent this
g0evcm,Mercento,the lack of workers is due to staggered working time to reduce contact that said cancelation could be handled better the reason why it is not handled poperly is again manpower issue
g0evcm,hugodevotion,a few tips for grab ding tai fung 1 riders drivers earn a living having no incentives and waiting more than 30 mins lowers income by 15 eg 25 15 10 2 timing many riders are out early everyday working more than 12hrs every hr counts if grab and shops dont recognise it soon they re gng to lose substantial business to competitors in the long run 3 drivers riders costs are either affected by petrol or by hrs cycling to and fro between locations even tho they may save energy or petrol there is no income for idle time 4 becos of covid 19 many have chosen grabfood and are trying to make some income to tide thru smaller bills incentives help riders drivers with more perks there ll be more people to help with the orders 5 lastly restaurants please give some thought to the people picking up food they re actually yr colleagues from operations if you don t treat them nicely they could be the ones advising customers to place future orders elsewhere think abt that yr marketing efforts could so easily be improved these guys on the ground if you didn t get any of these then i have a strong suggestion go do delivery for 2 weeks you ll learn a great deal there and know first hand how tough it is in this isolated environment
g0evcm,OldMork,just checked and they have some very nice offers to be delivered via grab seems like bad planning to have offers and then dont hire enough staff to process them
g0evcm,chippychoc,covid 19 budget cuts but f b industry overhwlemed due to this ordering thing idk if its just me also i had like 3 of my orders wrong last week including my meal for today no dressing lah wrong burger heck they even gave me the wrong order altogether but the receipt and bag is labelled to me lol i don t blame them and i rly rly rly do empathise with your dad
g0evcm,TheOrbOfAgamotto,also grab should extend the goodwill amount to all deliver partner since they are all affected and not only provide the goodwill gesture only when there s complain as suggest from the comment from u mrdabianz
g0evcm,maenadery,thank you that s great to know
g0evcm,localfoodconnoisseur,this issue is very common most times we grab riders face this problem as the restaurant refuse to stop accepting orders leading up to sometimes a dozen riders waiting outside because they want to serve their dine in customers first as they are priority to them
g0evcm,VarunGS,fuck grab
g0evcm,mrfatso111,problem is boss don t let us do that or we would to stop new riders from coming in and then can clear our queue
g0evcm,Achuapy,one has to make the journey there just to place an order the other places one immediately thought their phone if you are willing to head down they should get priotiy over those who place it on the app earlier as you have to factor in travel time
g0evcm,iwantaspudgun,thank you for sharing this wish this post is more visible to everybody i try not to give a bad rating to any delivery agents even when my food was toppled over unless the delivery agent was rude face to face as well but so far none if i m unsatisfied with the delivery at most i ll just not rate them at all since we don t see what s going on before we get our food it will be unfair to fault the delivery agents for everything
g0evcm,joeisnotsure,sounds like din tai fung s senior management s needs to be fired think of how many people are put in this terrible situation they made and if someone gets infected because of this heads will roll
g0evcm,thewickedmess,woah i was still thinking about ordering from ding tai fung for my upcoming birthday glad i stumbled upon this post nonetheless it is very unfortunate that this situation is taking a toll on everyone
g0evcm,toastrainbow,sorry to hear about the situation with your dad but thanks for telling the story it gives a lot of insight into what the delivery drivers have to go through i always appreciate their hard work and now have a better perspective what happens on their end i don t know about what goes on between the company and driver but if you complain of cold food or missed food items to grab or deliveroo or whoever does the driver get punished monetarily or ratings wise or anything almost always it s the restaurant who gives cold food some parts of order not done so already finished items sit around getting cold or not enough riders to pick up order not their fault and if i were to complain to the company i wouldn t want the drivers to get any backlash
g0evcm,rockymountain05,this is a huge fuck up by dtf their management needs to take responsibility for this maybe mothership or someone can write on this i see that their facebook page has no review section
g0evcm,evdaez,this situation happened at jurong point too had a stacked order and luckily i get to collect stuff at burger king first some rider no choice but had to make other delivery first but for i can t be arsed to wait for a freaking long time at din tai fun and canceled the order bonus was when one cancel makes me ha e 10percent cancel rate it s not only walk in customer leh about 10 riders are there had to made the choice between waiting 30 plus minutes with burger and fries getting cold or canceling that shit show and just delivering my burger king stuff luckily i did the latter having to wait for nearly an hour means no income when at the same time u could be making dough from 3 more orders din tai fung popeye during promo u can powernap and wakeup and order still not done yet prata wala wait time reduced abit during cd but pre cb gl clap hand liho tea wait for the 2nd drink ice from the first drink melt alr share tea 1 hour staff forget my order lol are pmuch the worse offenders
g0evcm,boysachok,tldr
g0evcm,zenqian,good on your dad for taking it in his stride my brother is hustling as a grab delivery guy too and it s absolutely horrible
g0evcm,jacksh2t,uninstallgrab
g0evcm,hellosss,ask your dad to look for jobs at this site too or you can look out for him and skip the middle man site not by me btw sheet2site com s dabaodash
g0evcm,xoxo86,my goodness that is terrible get penalized for doing ur job
g0evcm,Rockylol_,with this shit fest should i support food delivery services during this period for the past week i ve been trying to cook at home or just dabao cuz i feel like delivery riders are getting spammed with orders rn and don t wish to interrupt them
g0evcm,duckington92,your dad is a hero as are those out there giving it their all to support their loved ones in these very difficult times
g0evcm,studyingisoverrated,my heart goes out to all delivery drivers and hope that they can all remain safe and healthy drive safely
g0evcm,lastrit3s,looks like dtf ain t dtf
g0evcm,maybeitsme11,i wanted to order the promo but i won t anymore disgusting management by dtf so sorry that your dad had to go through this but thank you for making us aware
g0evcm,JJYEO,hopefully this issue would be resolved by wednesday the egg fried rice promo
g0evcm,Bryannnnnnnnnnnnnnn,just to clarify 2 5 hours is the total time my dad spent to resolve this issue he only waited 1 5 hours at the restaurant while receiving 1 3 of his orders and proceeded to deliver the only order however according to him because the merchant side did not cancel the order even though they said they could no cope his app was stuck on the pending offer for which he could neither go forwards nor backwards it also meant he could no longer take up new jobs and there was no option to cancel other drivers probably could as they only had one order my dad collected 1 3 orders so he couldn t go back he had to drive to the grab hq after failing to contact support in order for them to reset his app wasting even more time for which the total amount of time spent was around 2 5 hours hope this clarifies also i asked him why didn t he just reject when he was there before the first order was given to him he told me he didn t want the order to get passed on to another unsuspecting grabfood driver who may be older and weaker than he is initially he called the customers who still wanted to wait when the waiting time was stipulated to be 30 mins so he waited with them unfortunately it did not turn out that way
g0evcm,ICantDecideMyName,you can use their live chat function just inform them of your phone number and phone model and they should be able to see how long you ve waited keep in mind that the waiting period only starts once you ve reached the restauraunt so remember to press the button compensation is 4 if i remember correctly
g0evcm,UncomfortablePrawn,i agree that we should really treat the riders as nicely as possible maybe something we can all do is to give them tips if we can afford it something to boost their income a little in this tough time
g0evcm,thefibrobee,yeah by right when a restaurant gets swamped with orders what they can do is to temporarily close the restaurant on grab so that no new orders will come in so they can settle all the existing orders first be it grabfood orders or in store takeaways that s my guess based on a few encounters of a restaurant suddenly closing when it was nowhere near closing time while i was in the middle of selecting my food most of the time it was macs
g0evcm,jlonso,yeah hope an internal chat group opens up for the riders where they can consolidate their experiences in hopes to deter riders from accepting orders from merchants who bites off more than they can clearly chew
g0evcm,Intentionallyabadger,well they are losing revenue from the phv business so have to increase platform fees and delivery charges to make up for it the question now is whether they drop platform and delivery fees after don t think they will
g0evcm,Kurocha,to add on this topic please be patient have properly marked out addresses directions if delivering to a condominium it can be quite difficult and confusing especially for newer riders because of how different condos have different layouts and rules having directional instructions well defined addresses definitely help too had to deliver an order to cold storage at one point arrived at the designated address and it was a supermarket and wondered if they were the ones who ordered the food for their breaks etc turned out the customer was living in a condo behind the supermarket in the same building she was nice about it and came down to pick up the food though no hard feelings there though it was a pretty memorable and amusing story to recall
g0evcm,Vedor,if those people who complain why is your food is taking so long why your food is cold etc then perhaps they can go out and tabao themselves they will then understand why the food is taking too long or why the food is cold
g0evcm,justtosavestuffhere,depends on how much food was ordered also imo
g0evcm,stridered,grab needs to implement a way for restaurants to accept orders manually in the first place fucked up system which screws everyone involved with them
g0evcm,bryansng,thats how i feel when buy at the store myself however i feel like they need to alternate between walk in and delivery because they are all afterall customers
g0evcm,KUNNNT,ah shit i didn t know you could do that i ve been working part time for grabfood even before covid sigh the compensation i ve missed out over months would be significant
g0evcm,Desmous,some penny wise pound foolish mindset there
g0evcm,zidanes33,from what i know from my colleague he has relatives and friends working in din tai fung when covid 19 was starting to rise in sg and the travel ban for tourist was issued din tai fung actually retrenched alot of their staff both foh and boh my colleague brother was one of them now they come out with promo and they cant handle it because they are already on very low manpower but who can they blame but blame themselves
g0evcm,Dalostbear,sounds like management issues with dtf i mean as a chef if the restaurant manager cant organize the orders being accepted what for accept new orders they should also be accountable for waiting times both takeaway and deliveries
g0evcm,dustdream88,same was just wondering this and we typically pass the driver the tip in cash from my experience ordering food in america there are some really unscrupulous companies who were rumored to pocket part of the driver s tip rather than adding on in the app itself but i m glad to hear this
g0evcm,wfsparrow,it s not right for merchants to prioritize walk in customers just because they re physically there from my experience working in service positions i can tell u that i would be much more pressured to answer immediately to the angry and inpatient customer who is there in person rather than the delivery guy who s sitting around scrolling his phone 90 of the time it s really not a matter of right or wrong or principles it is a very simple psychological effect customer decides to never order from the restaurant again restaurant has lost a customer right and you ve already answered your own question it is very very unlikely that every single merchant faced by a food delivery guy will be so inefficient because it will hurt their profits too so your argument about next merchant being equally slow whatsoever moot the problem is op s dad did not choose to cancel and move on when op explicitly mentioned that a number of other riders did in that case he made the choice to wait that 2 5hr the lost opportunity cost is his to bear i also don t think any customer would actually want to wait 2 5hr for their lunch even if it is from dtf but idk don t see op addressing this in his post edit op has clarified that his dad was repeatedly given false assurances that the food would be out soon and all that so i understand why he did not move on and stand corrected secondly is it not possible for the rider to just communicate the situation to the customer so that the order doesn t get recycled to the next rider so that the customer can make alternative plans if you as a grab rider cancel ur order and don t bother to communicate the situation to the unknowing customer then i think u r part of the problem it is highly unlikely that the customer would insist on waiting 2 5hr for their lunch thirdly you re putting yourself into a false dilemma here you always have a choice i note that you mentioned the trade off for moving on to the next customer is what if the next merchant is slow will affect our incentives like i said it is not certain that the next merchant will be slow and secondly it s not like there are procedural issues barring u from moving on to the next order you can perhaps at the risk of making less in terms of incentives there s no either or situation here and i don t take kindly to your implying that i m ignorant because you assume i haven t spoken to a grab rider before this is a platform for people to speak their minds we don t all need to be experts or delivery guys to comment on op s post
g0evcm,nicholasccw,i don t blame them too being one of the understaffed workers is no joke i once worked in ichiban boshi and one time all the chefs went on break it was non peak hour and no one was there to make the food or drinks the manager was not there too me being just a food runner working on my second day had no fucking clue what to do and had to take shit from the customers because they couldn t get their food on time it was absolute dogshit and this lasted only a few hours i can t imagine how difficult it is like for these people to handle their job for the entire day
g0evcm,littlelightchop,ah i see thx

g0mek9,ChinaWine_official,i say when this is all over we should send these companies the bill why because they caused it there were many repeated warnings about how these dorms would be hotspots for spreading disease way before the pandemic started but these companies took the risk of squeezing foreign workers tightly so that they could make a bigger profit they chose to take this risk but when their gamble failed suddenly it s the government and taxpayer who has to make all these costly arrangements when the virus first hit our shores they should have known that their dorms would be hotspots and again they did nothing because it would have eaten into their profits when things were going well they were swimming in profits but now that things are going bad taxpayers have to foot the bill to move the foreign workers to hostels hdb flats and floating hotels and pay for their treatment and testing etc for capitalism to work properly companies should not be saved when they make a bad business decision this is clearly one of them we should treat and house the workers for now but record every dime we spend once this is all over send the affected dorm companies the bill for all the work our healthcare workers and govt workers put in
g0mek9,cowism,o you of little faith
g0mek9,Luc3Dio,agree they definitely need to share a large portion of responsibility for this if we can fine individual residents for endangering the public bigger organisations and companies should be held accountable too
g0mek9,v1p3rtooth,i think this opinion is misguided while in no doubt coming from the right place the dorm operators have been complying with all of the rules and regulations set by the authorities with regards to number of occupants provision of facilities etc i think it is singapore government that needs to step up and mandate improvements by amending the prevailing law a possible increase in the construction and maintenance cost which will find its way to singapore public in general can be partially or even completely offset from the current foreign worker levies that the government has been collecting majority of these levies amounted to 600 700 sgd workers and a bigger portion of these levies should be used to improve workers welfare
g0mek9,5spikecelio,i agree with your opinion that companies should provide better accommodations for the workers but i notice in your text this feeling of they are not our people why bother these companies already pay taxes the workers already pay taxes they live sometimes in singapore right so they are contributing to your economy i feel so much this undertone of they are not from singapore they are less than us these workers are one of the bases of your economy when i see heavy duty workers on construction sites i rarely see a singaporean i see hardworking people that are deemed less because they are not from a higher cast in the singaporean society sure make the companies act but its your government that is enabling this don t treat them as not your problem because they are it s your government allowing this to exist it s companies contributing to singaporean economy that hire these workers so don t treat as it s not singapore s problems because it is
g0mek9,agentxq49,i truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices demand for lower cost projects by all parties high land cost and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in singapore and as a whole the government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts they also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure some news reports here https www channelnewsasia com news singapore contractor in fatal viaduct collapse won bid with low safety 9082116 https www channelnewsasia com news singapore contractor in fatal viaduct collapse won bid with low safety 9082116 there are attempts to resolve this tho but the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins https www straitstimes com singapore housing govt to place greater emphasis on quality over price in public building tenders https www straitstimes com singapore housing govt to place greater emphasis on quality over price in public building tenders so the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive typically such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else ride sharing e commerce and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale but we don t see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or 30 dollar 2nd hand bid they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years the consolidation does occur with bankruptcies but here s a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016 https jobabroadblog wordpress com 2016 04 16 list of construction companies https jobabroadblog wordpress com 2016 04 16 list of construction companies and they all exist in different tiers we could force the costs down their throats say that workers require xyz amount of space and living conditions where would the cost go back to the construction project if squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn t possible it d then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process and back into the society sure we d fix one major sticking point here but where would the margin come from still corners cut from infrastructure worker wages more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do in the short term sure we can fine the companies and the dorm operators just remember that these dorms exist with bca s full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are i don t think punishment is the way to go but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward both would cost the society one in indirect manners via cut corners higher building costs and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation the other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled and well paid fwiw i ve commented on this a few times https www reddit com r singapore comments fz0khl foreign _worker _megacluster fn5dm9h utm _source share utm _medium web2x https www reddit com r singapore comments fz0khl foreign_worker_megacluster fn5dm9h utm_source share utm_medium web2x https www reddit com r singapore comments fye6rq something _something _wage fmzvjrx utm _source share utm _medium web2x https www reddit com r singapore comments fye6rq something_something_wage fmzvjrx utm_source share utm_medium web2x
g0mek9,skatyboy,did we as voters punish the pap for this back in the 2015 elections no right we didn t give a shit compared to so called bread and butter issues the opposition didn t make this a talking point during the elections that s the problem you can make loads of noise but does it translate to anything in the ballot box hence why i said it isn t amplified compared to too much fts which the pap did address like scrapping that population white paper i didn t say there s absolutely no articles don t twist my words sorry to say this but they didn t give a fuck because we didn t give enough fucks for them to prioritise it you can t solely blame it on costs democracy and staying in power is also to be blamed if costs were to solely be blamed why are we putting the brakes on fts and handing out prs to cheaper better faster pmets because we kpkb till they wake up
g0mek9,hurtbreak,i ve known some that deliberately hide pre existing conditions then go see a doctor after getting employed insurance doesn t cover the expenses since pre existing but mom regulations require employers to pick up the bill there are some who fake an injury to get a big workman compensation payment it s not hard think about how many friends you know who ve down pesed they then can go back home or other countries to continue working since the employers there don t necessarily have access to our medical records in the meantime all the medical expenses treatment and assessments are borne by employers until the workman compensation is settled and the worker can be repatriated oh also salary upkeep and accommodation x200b i understand why the regulations have to be like this and support it fully but the couple of bad apples have left a sour taste in my mouth
g0mek9,hotgarbagecomics,i m with you in that i really really hope the companies running the dormitories get fined massively after this is over their oversight complacency and greed caused this they should be penalized more than the usual wrist slapping over the last decade about taxpayers money being spent to treat the foreign workers i think it s still going to be much lesser than the subsequent social and economic costs if the government did not intervene the last few weeks have shown that no amount of appeals to common good is working people just don t give a shit those who ve run the dorms have been doing this years and there s very little chance of them changing their ways and if at all they do there s a question of whether they ll do it fast enough in a pandemic crisis where time is critical government intervention is the only way imho who foots the bill is a question best left for after the pandemic has run its course and i really hope the government slaps a hefty penalty on the companies
g0mek9,pngkunt,no private companies wuld actually aggravate the spread of the wuflu but under reporting and hiding cases if they were required to pay now saying that there is definite issue around cleanliness and standards
g0mek9,tehokosong,you also need to consider that checks were done by government agencies to clear these to be fit to live in minister of state manpower stated mr zaqy said conditions at the dormitory were found to be satisfactory when the last inspection was done on march 4 so if shitty conditions can pass mom inspection standards question to be asked are amenities adequate for the workers to use is the inspection criteria stringent to ensure liveability electrical plumbing etc or the inspection was done half fuck problem of deplorable living conditions have already been around from initial current satisfactory conditions are the laws standards created to hit the bare minimum of the workers rights social workers working with them have already mentioned these issues over many years source https www straitstimes com politics parliament conditions at punggol dormitory could have been better maintained as it was made even if the workers fuck shit up in the dorms isn t inspection meant to uncover these teething problems and reflect it to ministry dormitory providers i see all these moves by the governing agency to move them out as a way to solve current satisfactory but deplorable conditions on paper solve the now exploding increase of infection rate sweep their crap way of handling treating of fw from the past till current under the rug inspection criteria acknowledge but don t apologize for past failings wrt handling of the foreign workers situation ultimately we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above prices of hdb have remained pretty cheap while cost of workers have increased over time we as a society have also chosen to push them away from general population areas in fear of losing property value etc source https progressgp wordpress com 2009 07 19 serangoon gardens dormitory saga
g0mek9,iamabear1,while capitalism might be at play here i guess there are also some groups that are tightly pack together take schools and our military for example as a nation we are very lucky that there was no clusters in schools or camps if not we will be facing 3 huge clusters instead of just dorms then the argument would change about why singapore is so dense etc while acknowledging your points hindsight is a powerful thing
g0mek9,HokeyPokeyPoo,if the companies followed the regulations you can t just suddenly bill them for a public service cost any penalization will also have to follow the current sop set out for lapses occurred in maintaining these regulations changes will come but you can t apply them retro actively i understand the intentions emotions behind giving punitive punishments to the one that cause it but there are other factors to consider especially during this rough economic times
g0mek9,trashytraveller,to be devil s advocate these dormitories were sufficient for previous known viruses what we have here is a new virus that is more lethal and more contagious than previous widely spread viruses if we don t get a successful vaccine then all manner of calculations of the number of people for a given space that is sustainable needs to change this will affect public transport factories the size of offices even the optimal population for singapore so in that case the taxpayers foots the bill for the treatment of current affected workers but the private sector foots the bill for new accommodation suiting new regulations afterall singaporeans have known about these conditions for years and have continued to elect a government that has allowed these conditions to continue nearly everyone is complicit in this
g0mek9,zoinks10,who allowed them to do this who set the rules or failed to enforce the rules that permit this many people to be crammed into a dorm sure you want to blame the companies for stuffing these poor blokes into tiny dorm rooms but they could only do that because the law here permits it i ve not seen a deluge of posts on here complaining about the fact these guys are herded around singapore in the back of pickup trucks like cattle being moved to the market no one was complaining when their shit got cleaned or their hdb got built in record time this is a fundamental issue of governance these companies operated within the law largely i m sure there are some that do not therefore the problem does not lie with them it lies with the executive branch that sets the law and the population that elects them and or does not demand changes to this law tl dr take a look in the mirror before chucking blame at someone else
g0mek9,shibiwan,privatize the profit socialize the costs this is all too common here in the us too harvard business school 101 hope the companies will be held accountable after all this blows over at least the gahmen in sg are better at that than in the us
g0mek9,kamtresam,the standards can be made better if the companies were doing as per the law cant blame them anyways i am sure there will be medical insurances to cover for testing and treatment further companies should be liable to pay for food and basic recharge which i think they are as per the news report so i think the comment is bit uninformed as the systems already are there to pay for most if not all costs said above very few of that costs will be coming to the tax payer
g0mek9,SamBellFromSarang,capitalism you take away their bonuses they will just pack up and go elsewhere
g0mek9,flippingnoob,housing is the highest expense in singapore the cost will just be transferred to the end user making housing even more expensive like hdb s good luck new grads and millennials for the sake of ethics boomers already made their millions from the real estate boom
g0mek9,UnfairHelicopter,is anybody in the sub going to vote wisely everyone will vote for their hdb upgrades
g0mek9,GalerionTheAnnoyed,highly doubt this will work i don t think there s any current regulation stipulating that they can t do what they did nothing they ve done is against the law supposedly or else there would probably have been an investigation already for what it s worth it d be a dick move by the govt to suddenly make businesses pay for it when they didn t regulate against it in the first place
g0mek9,limjunjack,the government collected a levy for each worker from employers what these levies for
g0mek9,kkontagion,op is talking about getting the companies that run the dorm to pay not the fw s bosses
g0mek9,widowy_widow,my dad is a private contractor and hires workers for construction work even right now when there are little projects that he s working on he himself must provide for the worker s well being and it s putting a strain on him
g0mek9,elmachosierra,exploit how
g0mek9,houganger,the whole world be an utopia if all the should haves in the world gets done heck we wouldn t have c19 in the first place they d likely get away with a fine rather than foot the bills heck they d rather go into insolvency rather than foot the bills they could just run away with all that profit unfortunately capitalism is all about exploiting the masses to benefit the few
g0mek9,silentscope90210,mom has always been regularly inspecting the dorms by the way it s well known that the workers are crammed in there like sardines but nobody wanted to talk about it till covid came along if dorm prices increase then building construction costs are going to increase also which will increase your bto prices it s difficult finding a right balance

g0mek9,jupiter1_,then these companies will just charge you or anyone paying for their goods and servics
g0mek9,Roguenul,lol i appreciate the sj social justice sentiment but in this case naively applied at the end of the day the capitalist towkays will have their pound of flesh make them pay for proper spacing in dorms they ll just pass on the costs directly to you the taxpayer paying for these infrastructure so either way their profit margin is the same and taxpayers still foot the bill as always
g0mek9,thedellis,i think in general singapore needs to take a good hard fucking look at how you treat your slave classes
g0mek9,TheBadMoodKanye2,privatise the profits socialise the loss
g0mek9,psykong,for a short term solution yes you are right however it would become another cycle hidden away from us in the future when the foreign workers and their living conditions becomes forgotten and the companies decide to start exploiting loopholes in the systems collectively i still feel such situations could have been overall avoided if not for the fact that singaporeans have become an entitled nation the hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction we should have been learning from examples like australia where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people this also creates a sense of pride within our community going back to the main point if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs which is does throughout history such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred the foreign workers and their contributions have been immense to our nation building however this is a flipside to think about as well
g0mek9,bardsmanship,this is the best post in the entire thread you make some excellent points personally i think the way forward is to make the regulations for these dorms stricter by doubling the amount of space dedicated to each foreign worker so that the number of people living in 1 room goes down from 12 to 6 costs will go up but at least for housing the government can raise prices of btos and at the same time increase the amount of housing grants given to lower income applicants to offset the higher prices
g0mek9,iedaiw,you fine them they just close shop and open again
g0mek9,maliciel,you mean the companies that were running dorms that did not flout the rules set by the government
g0mek9,jotunck,then ultimately they decided it was worth the tradeoff for whatever benefits this job brings it s not a perfect situation but end of the day no one s forcing them at gunpoint to come here and live in these quarters to build stuff at relatively shitty pay whatever they re being offered to come here is likely a better deal than what they can find at home if even anything at all otherwise they wouldn t bother maybe companies have enough profit margin to provide a better deal for them maybe companies don t i don t know because i don t have access to their finances nor the knowledge to do those calculations then again end of the day for profit businesses will always try to give as little as people are willing to accept to remain competitive
g0mek9,dulceburro,these dudes build the city and do the jobs that locals don t want to do it isn t as though the government also didn t know that this was a problem and let it continue the government could have done something to stop this as well but nope build build build at any cost
g0mek9,paullampard,mom is culpable too it i their job to ensure workmen safety
g0mek9,npequalsplols,its kind of hard to just push the blame to dormitory operators do though it s easy to say that the company could ve provided solution but solution cost money and who s footing the bill dos usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels what are the demands how do we balance between quality and cost i believe that you wouldn t expect dos to operate at a loss unless they re doing charity and expected to make some profit say that i open a dormitory with better facilities everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others do you think that i will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other lousier dormitories are charging lemma if i m chosing a dormitory would i pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price would dos that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general then you might say that why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better then again who is paying for it if it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories how do we get people to do it if the cost increases are the workers suppose to pay for the increase or are the employers expected to absorb the fee or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers and we have another recurring problem then how are we going to ensure that cost of housing and maintenance does not increase if the cost is passed on the employers how are we going to help those whos affected by this change i think that this is an issue that isn t as simple as you think it is honestly
g0mek9,realestatedeveloper,what difference does it make as consumers of products created by these companies you re paying for it some way or another
g0mek9,warlord85,theese companies carelessness enables cheap labor that the population benefits from so in the end the population tax payers should pay back
g0mek9,bondbandito,lol they caused it fault is on the ministry of manpower for setting the legislation and ignoring ngos imagine if every business had to worry about ensuring standards hell no that s a conflict of interest problem right there it is the government s job to uphold the standards of the community and quite frankly most singaporeans are selfish af and didn t care even now they only care because it might spread to them but i digress mom dropped the ball big time they should pay with their jobs sack and get new leaders that s literally what lky envisioned don t do your job get the sack however we are with the inferior 4g pap
g0mek9,Safety1996,you forgot to add unpopular in front of the word opinion
g0mek9,asdfgMaster,i think you overestimated their earnings the main culprit is still the people who hire them i think paying them a fraction of what locals are earning is barely fair enough but they should at least provide more suitable accommodations at least
g0mek9,Alberqueque,lol the total opposite of their business model which is to squeeze every cent they can from people who aren t eligible for minimum wage talk about kicking a person when their down
g0mek9,Millicent_the_wizard,now is not the time to play the blame game but there should be open channels where the alarm for workers exploitation can be sounded off
g0mek9,nyaineng,lol look whos talking pap ib much
g0mek9,heyroons,doesn t the gov regulate these dorms
g0mek9,DavlosEve,something something profits privatized losses socialized
g0mek9,Talkingtomytoilet,high iq post unfortunately the ones you voted for are pro business and rarely if ever listen to voters
g0mek9,goldenpisces,from josephine teo s comments my understanding is that the dorms were compliant with the regulations some light breaches here and there maybe but generally were ok since mom took enforcement quite seriously we can t simply blame the dorms since the regulations themselves don t call for higher standards https www straitstimes com singapore manpower dorm standards should be raised says josephine teo https www straitstimes com singapore manpower dorm standards should be raised says josephine teo she noted that before such purpose built dorms were constructed many foreign workers lived in poor and unhygienic conditions and a decision was taken to build the current dorms to raise standards today s dorms have proper sleeping rooms with beds dedicated toilet and shower facilities recreational spaces with tvs and newspapers supermarkets or minimarts and dedicated sick bays they are licensed under the foreign employee dormitories act and must meet conditions including cleanliness water supply sanitation and hygiene of premises ministry of manpower mom officers conduct regular inspections to ensure standards are adhered to and take strong enforcement action against operators that provide poor accommodation occasionally i get complaints that my officers were high handed during enforcement when they are just doing their jobs in the workers interests said mrs teo there is no doubt the standard should be raised but it s more of an issue between mom and employers not dorms each time we attempt to raise standards employers yelp these are added costs which they must eventually pass on they ask mom are people prepared to pay more
g0mek9,SmirkingImperialist,welcome to neoliberalism is this news to you you really should watch what happened in 2008
g0mek9,amerpsy8888,jo teo dropped the ball big time isn t it it s under her watch and dorm issues had been brought up so many times she should take full responsibility
g0mek9,theblahking11,i assume most of them will have insurance so a lot of insurance companies will end up bearing the cost pushing the premiums higher net net the costs will be come to general public by the end of the day even if the govt doesnt decide to foot the bill also the disease dint come to dorms by own but it came to dorms cos someone somewhere decided that it s okay to go out when ill and passed on to dorm workers
g0mek9,Locastor,yes heaven forfend that humans live in humane housing conditions
g0mek9,lankanpot,we need to sort out the main issue first without arguing discussing on any other matter i think as people we all are responsible no one saw this coming if the one who created the issue should pay the price then it should be china who should pay the price as a government they would have maintained a reserve for this and should have been ready any day for a disaster like these plus i will only agree to fine the companies that are running these dormitories if the conditions of these dormitories are found in inhumane conditions other than this i don t see a point so let s cut the shit out
g0mek9,danielling1981,which then requires this labour cost to be suppressed so we voters contributed to this bad dorm conditions
g0mek9,zzxyyzx,oh no we can t have that it s bad for business you ll hurt the poor widdle faceless corporation s feelings what are you a filthy communist that deserves to be locked up without trial
g0mek9,EnycmaPie,right people like to talk about all the economical impact but no one stops to think about the people they are more than just statistic these are people suffering for mistakes others made
g0mek9,FeefaPlayer,i agree fix the problem first and then take corrective action against companies managing their workers inappropriately
g0mek9,-_af_-,oh yea tell it to my thoughts and prayers
g0mek9,cedricchoojw,agreed however it s not just the companies at fault government regulations allowed these workers to be squeezed together like that in the first place not just in the dorms but in the back of lorries too so go for the companies that profited off these and push the govt to finally give these foreign labourers the decent living conditions they deserve
g0mek9,anabolicfreak,it will just be a slap on the wrist
g0mek9,threedrops,hey thanks for the reply and i get your frustrations because that s what i have been trying to reply to comments here i don t have issues with the size per room i have stayed before but i do with two things the maintenance and the size of dorm the size is fixed by the mom guidelines of certain sqft per pax not the most comfortable but they are just cheap accommodation for the maintenance i know and i ve seen how sloppy it can get on facilities and all yes i think they should be subjected to fines for that size of dorm now this will fall under regulations which have to be changed to restrict mega dorms from happening again
g0mek9,Prata2pcs,this is the a reasonable and critical comment
g0mek9,jurongbirdparksg,this seems more realistic from a game theoretic standpoint if all other firms are housing workers using the lowest cost method possible then as an individual firm you can t hope to survive in the long run while still giving workers more living space and taking more safety precautions and even if all the dorm operators willingly go above and beyond the minimum safety regulations everyone has an incentive to deviate and squeeze more workers into one room so there s something like a prisoner s dilemma and the point of failure here is really regulation not individual firms you could argue that by making dorm operators bear the cost of treatment they will internalise the costs and risks involved in squeezing so many workers into one space but the social costs of a pandemic are way higher than the private costs of treatment you re making them pay for the cost of treating each infected individual but you re not making them pay for the cost of them spreading the virus to others so in equilibrium you ll still see not enough precautions being taken and i would argue that with black swan events like a pandemic that happen so infrequently and have so many unknown unknowns even if you impose a fine for each infected case that truly reflects the social cost of the pandemic i don t think it is realistic to think that this will induce dorm operators to take the right precautions
g0mek9,ChinaWine_official,yeah im pretty sure all the economists who argue for govt intervention to mitigate negative externalities such as this one are idiots also i m not sure why you think criticism must come with neatly packaged solutions criticisms are valid whether or not a better alternative is readily available it is valid to point out that for example coal powered plants pollute the earth that s just a fact that statement does not need to come with the following argument that coal plants should be replaced for it to be true just like the fact that taxpayers are paying for the negative externality caused by companies that hire foreign workers how is it wrong to point out the illogical
g0mek9,SomeguyinSG,i agree with what you said without these workers 80 of us would not have a hdb flat to live in
g0mek9,Drillbit,singapore gov and companies already profited billions of dollar by paying lowly foreign worker peanuts for decades now this include poor living place legal rights and lack of protection contract exploitation agent so yeah whatever gov pour money back into them it s nothing at the moment just hope they will be treated much better when this is all over
g0mek9,nosajpersonlah,this is the right answer here and should be wayyy higher than all these emotionally charged posts lowest bid wins is both a pro and a con and govt s insistence on following jt creates it s own set of problems
g0mek9,dawnfire999,this is where capitalism without any regulation leads to privatized benefits and socialized losses in fact it falls on the government to regulate labor the labor regulations for most white collar workers are laid out in the employment act whereas those on work passes migrant workers incl fdws are not covered by that act instead they are covered under the employment of foreign manpower act here s what the mom webpage stipulates https www mom gov sg passes and permits work permit for foreign worker housing various types of housing for housing of foreign workers which in my opinion is way to lax and provides enough leeway for employers to take advantage of the system
g0mek9,ngrenjie,it s not that i am against taxpayer money being used for this issue now that we have come to this juncture it s that we should not have to if only certain stakeholders had been more responsible in the way they managed matters so yeah i certainly hope these companies get massively penalised in some way i want to see blood
g0mek9,digital_bubblebath,why does no one want to get 7k a month i m genuinely mystified
g0mek9,ryuuheii,exactly the bugs will follow you on your clothes regardless of how hygenic you are unless you take the precautions of immediately throwing your clothes into hot water not your laundry basket like one would normally do and dont forget to heat treat your bag to make sure none hitched a ride there fastidiously washing your clothes is not going to help when the place is infested someone brings in the bed bugs inevitable considering the number of people hotels get it all the time and the problem is that the dorm operator is complicit in letting it spread uncontrollably
g0mek9,GeshtiannaSG,if they can only run their business with this sort of expenses then maybe they shouldn t
g0mek9,basilyeo,saf bunks should be the minimum standard sia
g0mek9,cary_tau,unfortunately it is not just infrastructural projects if this affects cost of building hdb it becomes a political issue too 5 years down the road when costs of hdb increases everyone will complain and who will remember that part of the increase is allow for a higher salary earned by these workers
g0mek9,galaxyuser,yes i 100 agree and consent to using taxpayer s money
g0mek9,normificator,thanks
g0mek9,skribe,bau won t happen for a very long time to misquote churchill we re not even at the end of the beginning yet the next outbreak will come hot on the heels of this current one and will be followed by the one after that the pandemic waxing and waning over the course of years there s just too many stupid inconsiderate people around even once we have a vaccine there will still be the people that won t take it screaming conspiracy autism i expect by the time this is completely over a great many social changes will have become the norm
g0mek9,KampongFish,1 literally difference in belief once again like i said i don t believe in capitalism negative externalities will never be covered by the market are you insane how much compromised rivers and seas polluted by waste and natural water resources occupied by private enterprise do you need before you realize government intervention is needed to mitigate that shit 2 sure you can be critical the hell are you on about i didn t try to censure you or attack your freedom of speech i can simply attempt to shoot down your criticism if it s a stupid criticism i think your proposal that tech would magically solve the problem is unrealistic and i think your proposal that simply putting in regulation is stupid your entire argument boils down to this prodding the market will fix it you are underestimating the shithole the market is 3 again i think you re being dumb you back yourself into a corner if you criticise coal but provide zero alternatives what do you do when asked so what you just tell them to have the market find alternative for you meanwhile the market is doing everything in their power to fund the notion that coal is a necessary evil through fudged bias studies and that coal isn t that bad that is not true it s because of extremely convincing proposals that alternatives are viable and the cost will be lowered that countries adopted a different policy you are pointing out wat you think is the illogical i am point out what i think is illogical the statement does not contradict
g0mek9,-PmMeImLonely-,landed also built by them
g0mek9,abuuzayr,and by that you mean hdb
g0mek9,Silverelfz,they work similarly i wouldn t put it past the dorm operators to be cutting corners wherever possible to make a profit because they have to keep the costs low for the fw s bosses as well it s symbiotic
g0mek9,lupCheong,amen to this home and twc have been screaming about these issues for donkey years since the early 2000s and nothing was done the only thing the gahmen did was to setup the mwc which is like the migrant worker s version of a union only lesser instead of choosing to work with home or twc which had a real handle on the issues that migrant workers faced in singapore welp we re paying for it now

g0mek9,pretentiousbrick,i compared you to a fascist of course i was trying to piss you off la but looking at your comments i m not sure it s worth our effort to engage further sometimes we dig ourselves into these entrenched positions and just refuse to budge we ll probably do better over a beer kopi
