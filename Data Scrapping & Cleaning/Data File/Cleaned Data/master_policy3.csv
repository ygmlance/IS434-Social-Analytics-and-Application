reddit,g13r08,Invalesco_POE,of course there are certain things the govt has done which could have been improved however the situation has evolved everyone knows that masks are helpful in preventing infections however how useful are they we didn t have any statistics back then and still don t to prove exactly how effective they would be in preventing covid and if it would be significant enough a preventive measure to possibly risk shortage of supply if everyone panic bought some of the initial advice was still correct that washing hands properly and practising proper hygiene is more effective in preventing covid infections because it is if people panic bought masks and we ran out of masks for healthcare workers it would have been disastrous if we ended up having healthcare clusters a shortage of healthcare workers due to quarantine and an overburdened healthcare system as a result given that the past week has seen a surge of cases there is probably now a worry that we would exceed our bed capacity if this continues given also that our supply of masks has now improved compared with feb mar if you balance the risks and benefits again it probably makes sense to change the initial advice and to ensure singaporeans wear masks and take maximum precautions even now doctors in some departments still have our masks rationed and are limited to 1 mask per day to prevent overconsumption

reddit,g13r08,windiven,no whatever country that the chief of who likes does not undermine the research done by the scientists there there is no benefit to be gained by the who for sabotaging the entire world with false research whether people wear masks or not doesn t affect the economy only the decision to lockdown does but either way containing the virus is the best way to help the economy it is not a dichotomy of either economy or public health the ministers were doing what they can to maintain some semblance of normalcy when the virus was still pretty contained because stopping the economy is going to harm the vulnerable who doesn t have much savings the most it is a legitimate tradeoff and tough balance to strike it is not an issue of face or greed in wanting to keep the economy going you think accumulating 5 million reusable masks is easy when every other country in the world is trying to hoard masks for themselves telling people to wear masks when not having enough reusable masks to distribute will cause an acute shortage

reddit,g13r08,Bearswithjetpacks,for one i think the task force in charge of dealing with this pandemic needs to be transparent with citizens and announce potential measures and actions they re considering for the coming months and educate citizens on the rationale behind major changes we could rip into the mistakes already made and point fingers but all that does is allow us ti vent frustrations what is upsetting now is that there is no indication that the people deciding the fates of the lives of many singaporeans have any clear idea what they plan to do no timeline no direction stricter measures would have made a world of difference earlier we re beyond that and i d like to know now what contingencies are being implemented and are there still more does the authority behind this have a plan for recovery for the long term and can the citizens be informed of their role does singapore have a plan masks weren t the issue the lack of foresight and leadership the lack of social responsibility and etiquette and unity these are the issues this turned into a rant more than anything so i ll stop myself here i think what could have been an opportunity to present singapore as a competent and attractive model to follow has and is still being wasted and it s embarrassing and infuriating

reddit,g13r08,Kopi0Kosong,i think the government was wrong to say in the beginning that people shouldn t wear a mask they were basically shaming people that were voluntarily wearing a mask that was wrong of them they should ve let people that were wearing a mask wear one of course the advisory itself to only wear one of sick was following who

reddit,g13r08,H3nt4iB0i96,i think most of the studies both before and during this pandemic that i find indicate that masks are largely ineffective at preventing a healthy wearer from catching the virus when taken alone but the nuance is that there appears to be evidence to suggest that it may be quite effective at preventing spread if an infected person uses them since this prevents some of the release of droplets into the air this was what informed the initial stance on masks but what i think they failed to recognise was that a asymptomatic spread was possible and quite common meaning that you may be able to spread the virus even when you don t show any clear symptoms and b infected people with mild symptoms might not heed the warning to use face masks a caveat to a here is that whether or not masks can prevent asymptomatic spread still hasn t been established however i think there s an extremely high likelihood of this being the case and it s really really better to be safe than sorry also the main reason why this was enacted only just now was because the government had just finished giving out its masks so they can justify policy like this
reddit,g13r08,DuePomegranate,that s a ridiculously small study and it actually shows that cloth masks are more effective than surgical masks viral load is measured on log scale so when patient 1 wore the cloth mask and reduced the viral load from 3 53 to 2 27 log copies ml that was a 10 1 26 18 2 fold reduction and patient 3 reduced the viral load by 12 6 fold surely reducing the viral load that you are spewing out by 10 20 fold is important

reddit,g1j2mi,Calikura,my experience my experience my experience everybody else s experience a good mask worn sufficiently tightly and covering enough of the face does make it more difficult for people to breathe a mask worn properly should make it difficult to run if you can still take huge breaths the mask might not be of very good quality and or there are large enough gaps between the mask and your face

reddit,g0j3cw,xenobyte2,tan kin lian is that you
reddit,g0j3cw,Varantain,i m curious why today cherry picked the workers party statement which was made on 26 march the circuit breaker announcement https www pmo gov sg newsroom pm lee hsien loong on the covid19 situation in singapore on 3 april 2020 was made on 3 april 2020 just over one week after the wp statement on the other hand chia shi lu s walkabout to distribute masks with an entourage was yesterday i don t think the wp would want to commit political suicide by having an entourage of one to two volunteers staff members or non constituency mps anymore
reddit,g0j3cw,Pyrrylanion,if he really know his ground then he shouldn t be on a non essential walkabout in the first place the government has been telling us that if we have no need to go out don t and this joker decide to walk around the neighbourhood and taking pictures with everyone shouldn t mp lead by example are we supposed to be happy that he managed to cheer up some of his constituents but made a mockery of our efforts to fight a crisis it takes everyone to fight covid including this joker who thinks a walkabout is essential even shamugam teleconferenced for media interviews showing that mps have no excuse to do anything contrary to measures for fighting this virus while your friend s parents may be happy i don t think many singaporeans are satisfied with his actions especially when most people regard walkabouts as do nothing mps wayang to show that they are alive and not idk dead or something perhaps its good effort but definitely lousy pr

reddit,g0j3cw,tj3333,surprisingly yes it s comforting to know that your mp listens to your concerns not only that most hawkers associations are actually extremely close with the mps grassroots advisors and there is an extremely robust feedback system between them

reddit,g0g50r,3lungs,not sure if that s me you re referring to but taiwan did start buying mask making machines once they got news that the chinese citizens worldwide were sweeping masks and sending it back to china i got this info from my friends in taiwan apparently the one who noticed was in charge of buying was the vice premier only difference is that i believe it s always harder to beat the person you re observing you see taiwan buying machines and by that moment in time they ve already contacted the sellers and arranged for quotations etc very hard for you to get ahead of them unless you already have connections to sellers

reddit,g0g50r,bondbandito,ah yes whataboutism to deflect criticsm the playbook of statists
reddit,g0g50r,pingmr,thank you the judgement of falsehood and how it affects public interests would come from the incumbent government s who has the data i am fairly certain their judgement is more aligned with mine i thought you earlier said sg matters has the data though just to refresh your memory how do you know that they don t have evidence ho ching posted 9 weeks ago on st engineering shifting production to singapore due to taiwan ban which we still have to source for raw materials btw and chan chu seng s leak recording on the government taking a gamble with the mask situation in feb and the youtube video of the taiwanese chief covid 19 official confirming that they disrupted our ability to provide masks how are these not evidence they have they know the numbers so just to check if we re on the same page that the data is with the government and not sg matters it takes time to cover a shortfall the government maintains a stable stockpile whatever is drawn down has to be put back and the shortfall will take at least two months to refill the points you raise here are valid but again they don t support sg matter s conclusion that if not for the taiwan export ban we d have more than enough masks with the ban we drew down on the stockpile and we now have to replenish that if the ban did not happen we would still need to maintain the same stockpile i really just come back to the point that having 1 million extra masks at this point heck even if we doubled the amount to 2 million we won t have more than enough masks and we won t have left over to give away again even with super generous estimations of 2 million masks being the opportunity cost sg matter s statement is false this is using numbers that you yourself provided multiplied by two just to be generous frankly after your explanation i still don t know why you say it will not be any time soon that sg matters will be pofma i can only think that it s because you don t think it will be applied equally sg matter s statement that singapore would have more than enough masks with leftover to help others is false they don t have the data for it they aren t going to be pofma ed
reddit,g0g50r,StewYourSoul,i think you have some serious problems with simple comprehension the dude above stated many times he doesn t believe either parties should be subjected to pofma but if you stood by the opinion that toc should be pofma ed then sgmatters should as well for similar reasons is it that hard to grasp quoting you on this they have they know the numbers what proof or evidence do you have on your part that they indeed have such evidence are you a part of the sg matters page and privy to certain data unlike the general public if you are not then your claims that they have any such evidence is horseshit looking at your data driven argument here you assume the capacity is more than 1m a month since it wasn t running on full capacity so at what capacity was it operating at you wouldn t know and you re just making estimation here on your part but sure i ll give it to you for the sake of your argument once again you assume only 30 40 of our healthcare workers would require n95 masks is there any evidence to support your estimation of 30 40 yep i thought so too lastly the poster specifically found fault with sg matters claim that we would have excess masks to export to other countries if taiwan didn t hinder our production i am sure with your great interest in the subject matter that you know there is a global supply chain holdup relating to the key material needed to produce the n95 masks are you sg matters privy to any information that suggests singapore has contracts in place with any suppliers of the key material therefore making sure we have a healthy supply of the material to produce upwards of 1m masks monthly didn t think so too are you aware of our current supply of the key material needed to produce the n95 masks and therefore our current ability to produce the n95 masks with full capacity didn t think so once again so how can sg matters and you be sure that we would have excess to export to others if not for the tw situation err you can t so if toc should be pofma ed for half truths as per your words it is fair game for sg matters to be pofma ed

reddit,g1umu6,miredonas,i think it is a trade off a lot of people on pavements are now subject to runners vapor while going groceries one asymptomatic runner can infect easily tens of people on their way in one exercise session maybe a better alternative is banning running on pavements if this happened already it is not implemented in my neighborhood yet

reddit,g1ousj,haikallp,oh yeah my bad
reddit,g1ousj,SeieiEnbu,on the other hand i think the fact that law enforcement in singapore does not normalise violence towards civilians speaks volumes about how civilised our society is in general i mean sure cops in delhi crack down hard on people breaking quarantine but people piss in the street and women get gang raped and murdered there too

reddit,g0x1i7,SamBellFromSarang,amdk mentions singapore singaporeans heavy breathing
reddit,g0x1i7,long_AMZN,masks work in a sense that they reduce spread of the virus masks do not protect the uninfected wearer from the virus though
reddit,g0x1i7,shitoupek,yup this worked well in taiwan and hk wearing masks since the beginning
reddit,g0x1i7,Cyanaliq,they do though not much but they do they reduce viral load someone coughs at you if you have a mask some droplets get caught in the mask and your initial infection has a lower viral load
reddit,g0x1i7,swordtailsg,i viewed this in the morning am surprised hank mentioned singapore a good video i must say definitely makes a lot of sense
reddit,g0x1i7,JustSomeRand0mGuy,heavy breathing fap fap fap fap
reddit,g0x1i7,bbfasiaolang,feels so good amdk love me pls rock hard
reddit,g0x1i7,Orangecuppa,pretty much history will judge us for underestimating asymptomatic cases altho the original reasoning of masks for frontline only is good due to supply the usage of reusables should have been enforced early on
reddit,g0x1i7,FitCranberry,uaaagh
reddit,g0x1i7,bondbandito,nope got caught off caught with inadequate supplies shifted goalposts from stockpiles being sufficient for citizens to saying oh emergency stockpiles means only for the few involved
reddit,g0x1i7,JusticePeril,did the gamble pay off
reddit,g15x6k,Drink82,i just tried the government issued masks and breathing is quite tough underneath the fabric given then new registration what s most comfortable to wear
reddit,g15x6k,boysachok,i think disposable mask is still the best
reddit,g15x6k,septeal,if you can breathe freely in it then that mask is not filtering shit
reddit,g15x6k,7_92x57_mm_Mauser,it s impossible to get one anyway either they don t have stock or they won t sell it to you
reddit,g15x6k,mrbearishungry2018,https www straitstimes com lifestyle four other dubious mask alternatives can t really say which good ones out there but if they can fit your face and give some protection i think it is better than no mask which will lead to a 300 fine now
reddit,g15x6k,itoku-sg,make your own as you ve said i also find the issued mask too small and too thick i ve made one myself following the videos on youtube
reddit,g15x6k,woowombat,none of the locally available reusable masks are very good but i ve seen a few impressive ones on people in public no idea where they re getting them from
reddit,g15x6k,Zukiff,i m using the 1929 mask it s comfortable to wear the entire day essential services need to wear entire day
reddit,g15x6k,pupusan,guys pitta masks do not help prevent spread of viruses or bacteria they re meant to help the user reduce the risk of pollen and dust allergies
reddit,g15x6k,Angryangmo,i was thinking the same just now also the government issues mask doesn t fit my son where can we buy reusable masks for the little ones
reddit,g15x6k,Drink82,it s filtering a 300 dollar fine
reddit,g15x6k,UmichAgnos,you can hang the cotton mask over the cartridges to cover the exhaust that s what i am doing
reddit,g15x6k,ThatAndresV,wouldn t a valve be there to make it easy for the wearer to exhale if so i can see how that s helpful for haze but it seems selfish for the current situation

reddit,g15x6k,jdickey,singapore the finest city in pap pte ltd land
reddit,g15x6k,maolyx,saw some kids reusable masks at unity in early mid march maybe can try there
reddit,g15x6k,bbfasiaolang,pitta has a prettt bad smell though i used to wear it even before it was cool and yeah it smells bad ez to breathe compared to n95 and govt cloth mask but reality the only thing it protects from is the fine
reddit,g15x6k,wanhiin,exactly this the primary use of a face mask in a pandemic is to prevent possible spread of virus from yourselves to other symptomatic or otherwise valved masks are designed for haze or industrial work providing comfort and form but very little in real function in this covid 19 climate
reddit,g15x6k,ylyn,anything helps if a pitta mask is the only mask someone will wear for the whole day then i rather they wear that and keep it on rather than wear a better mask and keep taking it off
reddit,g0y3ky,silver5182,some are more equal than others
reddit,g0y3ky,itoku-sg,if it s solely for the distribution of masks it should be give and go he still have time to take photos with the store owners as if it s for election campaigning this is certainly not essential and should be looked into for flouting the cb law

reddit,g0y3ky,Elzedhaitch,fully agree people don t seem to understand its not that the young are not getting the virus it s the virus are not affecting them as much so they get mild symptoms but you still can spread it to your parents grandparents who are more vulnerable if your family has more vulnerable people you have a responsibility to ensure they do not get infected not saying volunteering is not good but sometimes you have more than you to consider
reddit,g1qtcr,horsetrich,nice
reddit,g1qtcr,DarthAesder,can someone explain why you can t wear the straps inside
reddit,g3nnbm,GlompSpark,lets say you go out to buy food or whatever but the other party cannot hear you clearly through the mask are you allowed to lower your mask temporarily to tell them what your order is reading all these instant 300 fine news articles is making me paranoid
reddit,g3nnbm,roxasventus210392,i mean that would defeat the purpose of wearing a mask
reddit,g3nnbm,zenqian,no
reddit,g3nnbm,skybobobear,raise your voice
reddit,g3nnbm,rowgw,no but some people still do that though
reddit,g3nnbm,FitCranberry,try not to
reddit,g3nnbm,Sporeboss,please don t do that virus have no symptoms you can t confirm you don t have the virus please use hand gesture
reddit,g3nnbm,Aspirant2,yes did this in large font to a stall staff when she couldn t understand what i was saying
reddit,g3nnbm,GlompSpark,there is a big difference between lowering your mask for a few seconds so the other party can hear you and not wearing the mask for several hours while outside then you think we should not be allowed to take off the mask while using the basin in the washroom too
reddit,g3nnbm,sunhoanalwarts,so you rather expose the other party then bear with a few secs of public humiliation my dear nobody can recognise you with the mask on don t care just do what you need
reddit,g3nnbm,the4got10-1,you really think you should be able to take off your mask right when you are going to spew out the most amount of saliva
reddit,g291dh,SoulXVII,i m not asthmatic and don t have any actual breathing difficulties i m just curious
reddit,g291dh,Jammy_buttons2,yes if they go out so don t got out if you can lor
reddit,g291dh,thattragedy,i m not sure how it works but if wearing a mask affects your breathing then its best not to go out and risk losing 300
reddit,g291dh,thewind21,i am asthmatic i have always be sure to have an n95 around me during the haze yes it s difficult to breathe but it s still better than not breathing dead just find masks that are most comfortable i have air and other masks that are more comfortable than standard 8910
reddit,g291dh,-_af_-,1 high risk group should avoid going out 2 high risk group should do everything they can to reduce the risk 3 if it is so difficult to wear please dont go out
reddit,g291dh,FindingADeveloper,yes either don t go out or wear a mask
reddit,g291dh,fool168,haha if u have asthma or breathing problems ur chance of being a severe covid case is much higher still dunwan to wear mask very brave i salute u
reddit,g291dh,Luc3Dio,all the more you should be wearing one take care and don t go out unless necessary
reddit,g291dh,tatabusa,everyone except those jogging and toddlers under 2 years old must wear a mask outside their house
reddit,g291dh,vas_26x,yes cos they have a compromised respiratory system
reddit,g291dh,linusgrey,not sure about that perhaps if they can t get or pass the covid 19 bug they can don t wear that s the point no i suppose if someone really had that much breathing difficulties they should already be staying at home so not trying to be unsympathetic
reddit,g291dh,tom-slacker,asthma doesn t render a person immune to coronavirus
reddit,g291dh,detectivesher,get a doctor s letter saying that you have asthma just in case you need to go out and not able to wear mask
reddit,g28qux,lafietafie,doesn t it beat the point of wearing a mask in the first place why didn t the government ban smokers in the public pretty unhygienic too as some of them dump their butts on the floor after smoking which also have traces of saliva
reddit,g28qux,10000owls,bro you just found a niche case for a startup develop a mask where you can attach a cigarette to the intake filter and expel air through a mini chimney like snorkel you can use darth vader or bane as inspirations for what the mask ought to look like
reddit,g28qux,zenzoka,they ll obey sure if you instill enough fear in them but according to the same logic all other unhygienic practices and vices should be banned too remove public bins and allow people to only throw rubbish at home alcohol and junk food should only be consumed at home eliminate prostitution gay men forced to go through routine medical checkups people with hep abc banned from eating in public and the list goes on is that the utopia you re looking for
reddit,g28qux,thattragedy,there are videos of people altering their mask to smoke or eat maybe they can try that hahaha
reddit,g28qux,bilbolaggings,maybe someone should make a smoker mask that has a velcro cloth flap
reddit,g28qux,ChinaWine_official,by that logic if risk of infection is your justification then govt should ban exercise in public too lots of people run and sweat and saliva drip all over the place when they do and they don t wear masks in fact the smoker is better than the runner at least the smoker has to stand in one spot all i have to do is avoid smoking corners the runners will leave their bodily fluids across the whole neighbourhood
reddit,g28qux,Oscarizxc,you re on the next level of stupidity lol what about your used tissue paper that you keep dumping
reddit,g28qux,BreakWindow,i prefer that they smoke downstairs instead of at their window beside mine
reddit,g28qux,players02,what do you propose then
reddit,g28qux,Kopi0Kosong,are they coughing from smoking or covid
reddit,g28qux,ceddya,or just be considerate and don t litter
