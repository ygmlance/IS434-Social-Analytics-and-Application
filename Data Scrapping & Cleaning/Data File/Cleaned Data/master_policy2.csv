reddit,g5fh4h,gydot,bbt mei
reddit,g5fh4h,anthayashi,on normal days pausing definitely helps in this type of situation but not for today s context it is important to note that there are still people queuing to buy from store directly by pausing all online orders you might be able to serve the current queuing people better but once your pause end the backlog of advanced order add on to your current queuing customer will still be overwhelming especially for today since people are mass ordering last minute it is a decision between keeping it on and be consistently busy or pause it for awhile and gets 3 times more busy from all the backlog orders later on and on busy days such as today where orders keep coming in you hardly have time to go to the setting menu on the screen because the app will keep ringing thank you for your service during this tough period thank you it is nice to hear such encouraging words sadly my store will be closed tomorrow so i guess no income for me

reddit,g5fh4h,autonomy_girl,giving people a few days notice will simply result in queues for days that was what happened with the original cb and people were queuing over the weekend at ikea and supermarkets you give 4 days notice you think people will just queue once and be done with it people with such mentality will simply queue every day to get as much bbt they can drink before the shops are closed
reddit,g5fh4h,urcommunist,xmm hunter who buys bbt for his sugarbabbies

reddit,g5g76x,InTheSunrise,where does it say distancing and mask makes you auto immune to getting the virus a 0 1 risk is still a risk and all it takes is for one person within to be the transmitter and it can potentially escalate into a much worse situation is that not why we re told to stay home unless absolutely necessary and if you have to be out wear a mask and practice social distancing how is bbt so important that it s worth the risk
reddit,g5g76x,AureBesh123,hahaha this is really sheep like behaviour and i bet these are the guys that will criticize boomer this boomer that being a sheep transcends generations
reddit,g5g76x,ThePunnet,i think after covid 19 we would probably come out a lot more humbled perhaps the whole education system needs a rethink they re all on the phones looking at what exactly all this education and information and we end up in this state while this isnt representative of our society as a whole tonight we ve shown our ugly side once again so much for clapping for frontliners and really is this the best that we singaporeans can do sigh

reddit,g5g76x,drbaker87,less than 30 new local cases daily in a population of over 5 5 million that s because there is no mass testing of locals but do continue to envelope yourself in a false sense of security
reddit,g5g76x,defiance131,remember it is not just about adhering to the letter of the law the spirit of the guidelines is to reduce movement to a minimum and to avoid being out and about in the community this is the way to protect yourself your family and everyone else i think he s already said it better than i can emphasis on spirit the people in that queue are adults do they really need the rules to be spelled out to be in black and white just to behave
reddit,g5g76x,calicotrinket,i m pretty sure that began in the uk where of course they re having it a lot harder than singapore the difference is after their clapping they also show their appreciation for nhs staff and many of them are doing their part by staying at home meanwhile in sg you get medical staff being treated badly people being stupid like in this photo
reddit,g5g76x,sunnyabd,bruh it is falling people all over the world are under lockdown govs are spending unprecedented amounts of money to contain the situation 166k deaths businesses vanishing overnight you are fighting for the right to queue for bubble tea unless u can tell us for certain that theres no asymptomatic people in any of those bbt queues or theres 0 chance of transmission given the precautions taken then you are part of those inflaming this situation

reddit,g5efk6,aviationlad,this is for the best i know this will be a very unpopular fact that people may not like to hear and i will get downvoted to oblivion for this by the loyal bbt army but bubble tea is awful for your health during cb why for example brown sugar boba milk tea contains 92 5g of sugar according to this article i have linked at the bottom many of the other drinks are not far behind in terms of sugar content a simple google search shows that the american heart assosciation s recommended sugar intake for a male is 37 5g of sugar a day for men and 25g of sugar a day for women thus one bubble tea drink has 2 5 times to 3 5 times the daily recommended sugar intake amount couple that with sugar intake from other carbohydrates such as rice and it is a recipe for disaster for your body if you drink bubble tea everyday while sitting on your ass at home all day long like we all have to do now your blood sugar levels will begin to get worse and worse can lead to an early onset of type 2 diabeties hits close to home because my grandmother s brother in law is alias kadir a famous suria actor who i visited often got part of his leg removed because of diabeties please la health workers in singapore are already burdened with covid 19 cases don t pile more trouble on them by ruining your body https www channelnewsasia com news singapore bubble tea sugar content sweeter than coke soda 11063316

reddit,g5efk6,TheDamnCube,i was thinking this but then they should be open for takeaway and delivery since both offer meals and morning coffee can say both is predominantly drinks since people usually go get coffee only but both menu has quite an amount of choice for food
reddit,g5efk6,purplepopx3,probably don t want people to queue up at liho which definitely will happen
reddit,g5efk6,seolful,bakeries that sell bread may still sell waffles i think missed swee heng waffles
reddit,g5efk6,widowy_widow,brown sugar boba in my anecdotal experience is that one drink where you cannot change the composition of the drink or the flavor will change basically you can t change the sweetness level of the bbt because changing the sweetness level changes the whole flavour profile of it i m talking about traditional brown sugar where you have caramelised sugar and fresh milk added on top but if you re a bbt drinker that prefers less or no sugar then you re golden nothing wrong drinking a small moderate amount everyday or every other day
reddit,g5efk6,pannerin,these bakeries mainly sell bread not cakes we ll see

reddit,g7mc1e,Achuapy,just know that grab doesn t see you as an employee just a dispensable slave
reddit,g7mc1e,DuePomegranate,ultimately the conflict arose because the grab platform made it impossible for the shop to cancel stop orders while the grab delivery guys also couldn t tell until after they accepted the job that there would be a huge wait so instead of solving this problem it s easier for grab to look righteous by sacking the fella
reddit,g7mc1e,zet19,his public apology should ve been a mitigating factor maybe a final chance but perm ban maybe a bit harsh considering no one got hurt
reddit,g7mc1e,dcburn,while grab is really the root of the problem here and bears a huge share of blame in this incident how the guy behaved conveyed that he wanted to cause bodily harm to other people i e criminal conduct whether he really intended to or was just being showy that is a risk no company can take apologies or not after all the company can be liable to anything that an employee does while in the employ and under active duty and carrying the stated line of work if there was an altercation the victim can sue grab as well and also if grab chose to just issue a warning and let him stay on the job they are sending a signal that your next grab delivery person might be just as dangerous if triggered life s always been unfair but we are after all fully responsible for our own actions in which this guy has fully accepted with his apology and has indicated he will learn from this incident
reddit,g7mc1e,thattragedy,there s a better way of saying what he said to the rider without using vulgarities don t forget that the bbt guy is working in service industry he shouldn t be swearing unless he s talking to his colleagues during their private time
reddit,g7mc1e,bbfasiaolang,remember you re not a grab employee you re your own boss this gig economy sounds glam but it harkens back to the day of unionless lawless wild west jobs
reddit,g7mc1e,ngrenjie,the hooligan would have been the one to successfully get your food amidst all this chaos
reddit,g7mc1e,je7792,although grab is partially at fault but the delivery rider getting ban isn t really that harsh i mean if you were in any other job and you try to fight your suppliers and get caught on camera you d probably be fired
reddit,g7mc1e,wowspare,grab has had a bit of a bad image to begin with if they had given him a second chance especially after that apology it would have been good pr for them

reddit,g7mc1e,557088,yeah he s not the only rider waiting crazy long for his bbt order hundreds of riders across singapore were facing the same frustration but none of them caused a scene like this if grab keeps him as a delivery rider what does it say about the attitude they allow their riders to have it s ok to lash out like this if someone says vulgarity to you

reddit,g7mc1e,XNights,eh fair enough for the first one was on my phone lazy to type out that i did grabfood part time during uni now not doing to avoid taking other people rice bowls now for the shop one issue is for the shop side for the shop to even receive an order a grabfood rider has to be tied to that order before any of them cancel when the shop says stop order it simply just stop accepting new orders but orders that has been confirmed is still being loaded to the machine also 3rd grab don t take the comission slice until the food has been delivered if you order from grab you will also notice the charge only come in after the order is complete also for the another one dinged order is because the system wasn t able to find a rider willing to do the order the system searches for an rider for half an hour before cancelling the order but in this case the order still came in as the order on the customer side has already been sent and the rider was found maybe abit later short of half hour mark hence why it felt that stopping it didn t stop the orders it just simply found the rider later that s why the order came in later
reddit,g7mc1e,rostiii,i think it s harsh but it isn t unexpected grab is just like any other company let s say we apply the facts of the case to another company eg facebook 1 facebook is currently receiving 10s of thousands of applications from job seekers it doesn t lack in staff nor good potential hires 2 facebook s staff threatened its business partner s staff with violence 3 facebook gets in the news for this and it negatively affects its corporate image 4 facebook decides to fire this staff and hire someone else instead grab is definitely not short of partner applicants i applied 3 weeks ago and haven t heard back they did tell me that approval won t be fast and that they will do a check on my traffic offence history which is clean
reddit,g7mc1e,samglit,unfortunately he made himself a liability if he ever got into an altercation in future grab would be accused of keeping on someone who has a history of losing his temper unless they had a position for him in the back office there was no way to keep him customer facing
reddit,g7mc1e,SamBellFromSarang,then every time driver got tussle just go fb beg to be unbanned case by case is always nice but it begs people to exploit you or question your code of conduct
reddit,g7mc1e,mantism,unfortunately there s plenty of video evidence that the grabfood rider was causing a scene unless there is similar evidence that he is overwhelmingly in the right to do that there s no way he s not going to get fired especially since he s a lot more aggressive than the playmade staff in the video shouting cursing gesturing needing to be physically pulled away vs one dude behind a counter no matter who is right or wrong the rider is in the worst position now and will be treated as such heck he even has his mask off and intentionally closing in on others he might even have it worse if the authorities decide to charge him for breaking social distancing if the bbt dude jumped over the counter and the two started duking out hmm would be a different story
reddit,g7mc1e,vanillakopi,from your comment it s clear you have 0 evidence to suggest that the playmade staff behaved in a manner that warrants him getting the same punishment as the grab driver so stop trying to argue for something that will never happen what s there not to judge the guy made a commotion behaved aggressively and threatened to beat up someone verses someone who made a vulgar comment did the playmade staff behave aggressively too no he didn t many other grab food drivers facing the same situation but they choose to remain calm and collected understanding the predicament that they are in
reddit,g7mc1e,lupCheong,wait so continuing to hire some unstable guy who got triggered by vulgarities and challenged people to a fight right in front of a crowd and is about to get charged in court during a pandemic no less is good pr what if some customer uses vulgarities on him for whatever reason in the near future and he has a weapon and goes crazy on the whole family how would grab s public image look like then grab really has no choice but to do the safe thing and terminate him they have more than enough people signing up to work for them anyway
reddit,g7mc1e,ybct,in the eyes of the law they are not equally at fault which is why one lost his job after getting arrested and one did not nothing to do with life is unfair if he yelled once back and then left most likely he would not be arrested but if you cause unnecessary drama for long enough that someone calls the cops then on your head be it
reddit,g7mc1e,rarakat,yes every small actions lead to a bigger picture but with all the salty downvotes they think this isn t justified anger is a tool use it as a motivation for change or negotiation not violence or hostility if you all think perm banned too much leave the grab system go support join other competitor if time isn t right plan ahead to prevent this thing happen to you riders end of the day think of your family or loved ones before doing anything so dramatic as this
reddit,g7mc1e,savagehardin,ah the beauty of outsourcing much reduced risk
reddit,g7mc1e,BR123456,those lines sound like some mlm pitch lel
reddit,g7mc1e,MadKyaw,source me saying that doesn t really give you much credibility who are you an employee of a shop that uses grab some random person that decides they know more on the topic it would help if you gave more context the issue is that the orders that has already been accepted is still coming in that is the fault of grab not giving the option for shops to refund the order because grab had already taken their commission slice there had been accounts of other posts where one user recalled that after they cleared a ton of grab orders another one dinged and the manager yelled in frustration after trying to shut it off during the announcement day i agree that the timing the govt decided to extend the cb was horrid it caused massive chaos but the issue i m talking about is grab failing to have basic options measures despite being such a large company
reddit,g7mc1e,SoulXVII,i think the issue isn t whether he should be punished because most would agree it would be fair but that the punishment was too harsh
reddit,g7mc1e,jamesinsights,altho that s what playmade officially released there s been some accounts that he said more than that directed at the rider
reddit,g7mc1e,prolix_verbosity,let s be clear i never suggested that the playmade employee should be punished in like manner i ve made it clear that all i m saying is don t judge the grab rider without knowing the full picture hypothetical say the playmade employee actually said f your mother lah you didn t hear me say must wait very long meh grab rider loses it employee sees his reaction is afraid behaves passively a lot depends on what exactly the employee said you don t know i don t know so again i m just saying don t judge
reddit,g7mc1e,BBoizTZH94,apparently some witnesses commented in the playmade s facebook post that he also said shut the fuck up and just wait grab rider s just trying to earn some bucks time is crucial for them
reddit,g7mc1e,lurkinglurkerwholurk,grab drivers are also in the service industry so that s peer to peer talk not one from worker to a customer and yes i know i m stretching the use of the term given that they re from different companies plus that one word is hardly a hard hitting long stretch of vulgarities if the recounting of events are correct its use where it is is more a frustrated emphasis than a targeted insult so for the grab driver to go ballistic as he had is just wrong
reddit,g7mc1e,cheekia,it s the drivers own fault that he couldn t control his own fucking ego everybody already stressed don t cause more problems by constantly asking whether your order come yet he step gangster then go step gangster by himself la
reddit,g7mc1e,k0lv,nope
reddit,g7mc1e,avocado_law,cos the narrative is already formed here that grab is at fault and majority of r sg already in opinion that grab is the villain thats just how anonymous online discussion is
reddit,g7mc1e,kurrysauce,both were equally at fault maybe but only one party went ape shit during the altercation and you wonder why life is unfair
reddit,g7mc1e,auroraxan,common sense is probably correct but we gotta consider every party as innocent until proven conclusively as guilty the grab driver has been proven guilty of his accused actions via conclusive video evidence the playmade employee only has unverified fb accounts against him which wouldn t hold water in a court of law unfortunate yes but that s just how it works
reddit,g5u46d,tenbre,i m sure grab is largely to blame and the bbt shops could have tried to do more to stop it but the customers also to blame for mass ordering bbt at the last minute as irresponsible as those who go and queue up
reddit,g5u46d,gydot,during this time our team had received over 150 different orders an average of 600 cups via delivery alone within the last hour of closing despite efforts to stop orders from coming through wah sounds like full days worth of orders in 1 hr
reddit,g5u46d,stridered,don t worry grab s just going to pretend that there s nothing wrong with their system and just blame the vendor and delivery guys
reddit,g5u46d,PmMeYourNoobz,i feel bad for the workers some of them must be scared out of their wits i know it sucks but be a gentleman la
reddit,g5u46d,sneakpeek_bot,man arrested after argument breaks out at playmade bubble tea shop singapore a 38 year old man was arrested on tuesday apr 21 after an argument broke out at the playmade bubble tea shop in waterway point the police said they received a call for assistance at about 9 40pm at the mall located at 83 punggol central and arrested the man for public nuisance advertisement advertisement police investigations are ongoing videos of the incident have been widely shared on social media in the footage a grabfood delivery rider is seen having a heated argument with playmade employees advertisement advertisement in a facebook post on wednesday morning playmade said it was aware of the videos during this time our team had received over 150 different orders an average of 600 cups via delivery alone within the last hour of closing despite efforts to stop orders from coming through this had brought immense pressure on both our team and delivery riders to complete within that short time frame to closing it said the bubble tea chain added that it is thoroughly investigating the incident with the relevant authorities and also apologised to customers and delivery riders who were affected the incident at waterway point took place shortly after the authorities said that more shops and food and beverage outlets in singapore will have to suspend operations following the trimming of essential services as part of stricter measures to stem the spread of covid 19 prime minister lee hsien loong on tuesday announced the extension of the current circuit breaker period for another four weeks until jun 1 to decisively bring down the number of coronavirus cases cna has contacted playmade and grabfood for comment download our app or subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak https cna asia telegram 1 0 2 source code https github com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github com fterh sneakpeek
reddit,g5u46d,Bcpjw,i wonder if the foreign workers in their dorms who read this news or saw the videos of this bbt drama panic while their colleagues and friends are admitted to hospital would they laugh or cry maybe both
reddit,g5u46d,Foxie13x,feel that way too unfortunately the rider did overreact physically and 2 wrongs don t make a right
reddit,g5u46d,silentscope90210,can t the store just call up grab and tell them to cancel all pending orders
reddit,g5u46d,urcommunist,whoa shit gone crazy
reddit,g5u46d,saininnia,that gf guy is rude and all but shouldnt they arrest grab as well for allowing these illogical orders
reddit,g5u46d,MamaJumba,i didn t say that did i edit apologies for my tone i just feel unfair for the grab personnel and if i were to find fault i think grab the company and playmade are more to be blamed
reddit,g5u46d,bilbolaggings,yah it s a first world slum
reddit,g5u46d,fallenspaceman,waterway point and city square s decathlon on sundays are the very definition or hell on earth
reddit,g5u46d,Intentionallyabadger,we won t know if this is the only store that had the issue just because the media didn t report about the rest doesn t mean it didn t happen so i guess it s not a fact lol
reddit,g5u46d,belmont_lay,he s an og
reddit,g5u46d,rockythebalboa1990,i m sure the stop gap measures announced at 5pm with no preemption has nothing to do with this
reddit,g5u46d,jinhong91,they will worrying if they caught the virus or not those that are confirmed cases probably how lucky they are for not being a serious case
reddit,g5u46d,nyaineng,feels like playmade owes the rider an apology and police should just not charge the guy
reddit,g5u46d,KenjiZeroSan,if you put it that way we might as well go ahead and arrest the customers who placed those orders too
reddit,g5u46d,CheekyWanker007,uhhhh auto off
reddit,g5u46d,myaimsucksowo,saw a comment on one of the posts in the subreddit yesterday stating that it s not easy for the merchants to stop the orders from processing on the delivery platforms like if they were to pause orders for 1 hour say 7 pm to 8 pm many people can preorder their drinks at maybe 6 55pm or 7 05pm so instantly once their store reopens they are flooded with orders they cannot stop also the person commented that they cannot pause their stores too long otherwise delivery platforms will think they are having problems with the system it s hard to really tell who is at fault here just a thought from reading through posts
reddit,g5u46d,leo-g,and it warrants this reaction
reddit,g5u46d,123dream321,punggol is young family district very little yp
reddit,g5u46d,Shuyi000,punggol new district leh where got yp
reddit,g5u46d,SamBellFromSarang,i mean it starts from the fact that they tried to call first and if the customer service is jammed they can t get the request in the first place remember that this is a freak incident with 600 sudden orders grab probably didn t expect this to happen and didn t expect a store needed to so desperately cancel orders in another comment there were safeguards in place but they were essentially overridden with this huge influx fact this was the only store that had the issue no other reports have come out of other stores facing this
reddit,g5u46d,ybct,the earlier you tell people about it the earlier they gonna queue up to panic buy you tell them about it at 2pm they gonna queue from 2pm to closing time you tell them at 6pm they can only queue from 6pm to closing time which one is fewer people
reddit,g5u46d,Arcturion,that s right the measures anounced had nothing to do with this the govt didn t ask everyone to go out and buy bbt during the announcement
reddit,g5u46d,Nissan_23,tfw no stardew valley

reddit,g5u46d,Dreyer2,the shop staff may have been rude but the grab guy was more than rude he was trying to intimidate the staff
reddit,g5u46d,yeeez1,well you can t see what you choose not to see ask any staff member at any liho koi gc any other bbt outlet and see if they had the same issue of overwhelming numbers of orders hundreds of people waiting to collect their drinks deliveries and an uncontactable support hotline bet you every single outlet that tried to cancel that night couldn t get through some other commenters noted that even if they got through hotline reps just hung up on them halfway through the call how to cancel orders liddat their current support staffing levels are already so bad that urgent live order issues take at least 20min to be attended to on a normal dinner peak what more with something like this
reddit,g5u46d,caramellocone,what s with this retarded trend of starting sentences with i mean do you usually not mean what you say so dumb
reddit,g5jxen,dodgelivechoseme,i would like to understand the mindsets of people queuing up to buy their last dose of bbt considering the government has already put measures in place advising people against gathering in places from my point the island wide craze potentially undermines the effort of healthcare workers and contact tracers have done so far in isolating the community outbreaks we shouldn t have went out in such numbers just to satisfy cravings addictions this minor inconvenience will pass soon as long as we minimise congregating in such numbers during this cb community outbreak has improved can t recall where i read this from there are still unknown clusters that have not been detected and by going out in such force it seems like we are asking for a third wave of new infections
reddit,g5jxen,BreakWindow,for their instagram stories
reddit,g5jxen,helloween123,because they are covidiots
reddit,g5jxen,_amandaz_,same similar mentality that hoarders had value increased because they aren t certain when they can have it again or they do not understand the importance of the measures tbh it should have been announced with immediate effect or the list should ve been released at 23 30 hrs just like pm s speech was announced roughly 30mins before it happened
reddit,g5jxen,isaactanyien1234,cause they are fucking idiots who do not understand the sense of urgency
reddit,g5jxen,eclipse-mints,sugar bbt addiction overwrites all rationale thought
reddit,g5jxen,Ender_Dragoh,it is nice but i think it is too overrated
reddit,g5jxen,urcommunist,cause sinkies are basic and that s the only thing they drink
reddit,g5jxen,Pirotez,partly i m sure many of them just wanted to feel like part of a society and get out of the house after being cooped up
reddit,g5jxen,thattragedy,yeah actually i also don t get it leh but at least the bbt shops was able to earn money on their last day hopefully its enough
reddit,g5jxen,ZehzehHerePain,that s why governance is important failure to foresee and learn from the past has resulted in this situation there will always be inconsiderate people there will always be law breakers unfortunately actions of these ppl affects others thats why policy and enforcement goes hand in hand
reddit,g5jxen,tictactorz,this is the only correct answer
reddit,g5jxen,dodgelivechoseme,it s a fair point tho to make and i wouldn t view it as blaming the government announcing the closure in wee hours of the morning may have avoided a situation like this but imo it would not have been feasible as mcd closure was a corporate decision as long as management made the necessary arrangements they can shut down anytime but for government policies such as this it requires time for the agency to answer to queries of people calling in
reddit,g5jxen,Arcturion,this is the right and enlightening answer explains both the panic buyers and bbt addicts
reddit,g5jxen,waitinforapocalypse,no u bad stop h8ing
reddit,g5jxen,dreadfultiten999,they sdubid
reddit,g5jxen,123dream321,you can say this now but remember the repercussion from the actions of these people will be shared by both the gov and the citizen touch wood i just hope that we don t get to the point where these people regrets getting that one last cup of bbt
reddit,g5jxen,-_af_-,yea i actually liked how macdonalds handled their closure announce on sun early morning people still not awake to actually rush the outlets if you are like me by the time i woke up it s all over le
reddit,g5jxen,mydslrjourneys,if the govt announce it at 9pm or after shops have closed imagine the amount of stocks such as fresh milk or eggs going bad and the shops having to throw them out just take it as he is giving them time to clear off whatever perishable goods they can clear many bakers are being affected right now because their milk are not going to miraculously stay fresh till after cb is over
reddit,g5jxen,Jammy_buttons2,simple unlike mcd which is just 1 company mti has to inform hundreds if not thousands of shops and business that they have to close who then have to inform their staff they can t just inform the businesses before hand until the embargo is lifted
reddit,g5jxen,zyrapenguin,boba is life i hope you don t want that to actually come true literally also it s not just your life it s other lives too
reddit,g5jxen,veryfascinating,there would always be a rational reasoning to why people do what they do as a sidebar can i ask what is the rational reason to the people in the us who came out to protest for the lockdown to be lifted and then marching and protesting at hospitals blocking ambulance routes and threatening healthcare workers i am struggling to see any flicker of rationality in this
reddit,g5jxen,KunningKruger,im guessing the reason they do this because they genuinely do not believe that the virus is a big deal its a hoax some of us have to die for the betterment of the nation we already have drugs to deal with it pick one once you don t believe that the virus can kill millions any measures no matter how slight seems like an invasion of your freedom and drastic measures seem insane
reddit,g5jxen,Achro,it s not a us thing there are protests everywhere from france germany india brazil etc most of the reasons have been business economy related i mean people on this very subreddit have been debating their anti lockdown positions economy lives with comments with many upvotes so it s not black or white as you framed it
reddit,g5erjf,coffeeteaormeh,it s on their name
reddit,g5erjf,lilneonate,lol i was waiting to order bbtea this week but i guess i ll have to wait for this entire thing to be over
reddit,g5erjf,A-Chicken,they count as a supermarket on the level of cold storage and ntuc true to form i just checked the opening times only the changni airport t3 one is closed but that s the one that only sells sweet potato
reddit,g5erjf,asbvg,so is 7 11 closed
reddit,g5erjf,MKUltra1221,this only applies to physical retail right can still buy from online booze stores
reddit,g5erjf,Twrd4321,yes
reddit,g5erjf,557088,they changed the definition from predominantly beverages to only beverages starbucks do have proper sandwiches and bread so they re exempted
reddit,g5erjf,Ruique,hate to ask this but if specialised shops selling these snacks are closed wouldn t more people flock to supermarkets
reddit,g5erjf,dabestinzeworld,they only sell the bottom shelf stuff though
reddit,g5erjf,maxapug,hello chwee kueh you snack or meal
reddit,g5erjf,pannerin,no except for convenience store in parks
reddit,g5erjf,Tempestuous-,ok they are open
reddit,g5erjf,smile_politely,went to starbucks plaza singapura couple hours ago the barista said they ll be open usual tomorrow but i have doubt perhaps he s not well informed
reddit,g5erjf,Logi_Ca1,yeah they are my usual breakfast too
reddit,g5erjf,_amandaz_,starbucks and cbtl should still remain open because they sell food along with drinks especially cbtl
reddit,g5erjf,rowgw,i see then the gossip i got was wrong then i am curious now whether starbucks and coffee bean going to be opened until 1st june 2020 or not
reddit,g5erjf,Darkblade48,guess we ll find out tomorrow
reddit,g5erjf,Mmscstar,donki still open fat mei mei who wear pyjamas go supermarket still need a place to go
reddit,g5z9lf,IAm_Moana,crappy situation all around employee frustrated because he s stressed out and probably not paid enough to deal with this shit grabfood driver frustrated because every delayed order is a dip in his income covid 19 sucks everyone please stay home
reddit,g5z9lf,jieqint,playmade said that in order to cope with the surge in demand after customers flocked to its outlet one of its staff members had pressed a pause button on the grab device to stop further online orders from coming in however the company said it was unaware that there were already more than 100 orders in the system waiting to be matched with grab riders as well as orders that would continue to be matched in the one or two minutes after the system was paused playmade said it was during this time that a grab food delivery rider expressed his impatience at one of its staff and repeatedly demanded to know how long he would have to wait under pressure and out of frustration our staff responded that if he had to give an estimate it would be a f long wait the driver reacted angrily and asked our staff for an apology said playmade
reddit,g5z9lf,SpongeBobBobPants,government gave ample time for f b industries to adapt to the cb during the first cb yet we have people going into clubs bars to get drunk on the last day before the cb kicks in ok so you want government to give time to bbt buyers and the stores what makes you think that the bbt buyers would not crowd around the stores on its last day of operation should the government come and knock on everyone s door and tell them to stay the fk home government can make all the laws and rules but if people are not socially responsible to follow them is it still the government s fault edit please lah if your bbt queue is that long and you still want to queue you are just being an irresponsible idiot waiting to get covid 19 if your dinner queue is that long and you still queued for it i respect your stomach but i will be pretty god damn sure i will avoid that stall and choose a stall with lesser queue you buy dinner to survive you buy bbt to survive priorities a bit off
reddit,g5z9lf,throwaway268190,haha not that they scared because we have an actual law that makes protesting illegal if we don t have such a law trust me these idiots will block roads to hospitals just to get their bubble tea fix
reddit,g5z9lf,thattragedy,lol don t drink bbt for 1 month can die meh people all go there and create a cluster fuck and might give our country more problems
reddit,g5z9lf,coffeeteaormeh,kinda hard to get a 9pm broadcast
reddit,g5z9lf,sianzzzzzzz,simple if there wasn t a surge in demand then there will be less orders for the bbt leading to less stressful and tense situation for both the employee and grabfood delivery rider and the fight might not have occurred the article did say it was the surge of orders that made the employee upset
reddit,g5z9lf,2dy_fish,note to self before the government makes an announcement pause the delivery app
reddit,g5z9lf,leo-g,it s a fucking free market if these people wanna queue up there s nothing stopping them if you ask me the grab driver is the most problematic one for being butthurt
reddit,g5z9lf,Shuyi000,error 404 priorities not found
reddit,g5z9lf,zenqian,in other news tapioca flour in grocery stores are largely sold out
reddit,g5z9lf,KenjiZeroSan,agree better yet announce after the shops has closed for the day
reddit,g5z9lf,557088,do we need to find a culprit to blame for every incident people order from grabfood because the option is there and didn t think it ll be that much of a chaos playmade staff got stressed by the overwhelming orders and said the wrong words grabfood rider got stressed by long waiting time and and employee s words angered him if you really want to blame blame grab for not giving stores an easy option to stop orders from coming in and store manager chain management for not closing the store early
reddit,g5z9lf,TheOrbOfAgamotto,put it this way assuming the employer is willing to pay 500 bonus per order it s likely the gf and delivery rider will feel better since they are immensely incentivised then is it the fault of the employee too then for not providing an adequate incentive resulting in the ugly situation my point it it s certainly the fault of both rider and bbt employee the people ordering bbt could be a contributing factor but it s certainly not their fault
reddit,g5z9lf,evilplushie,they re not even there at the spot where the fight took place
reddit,g5z9lf,ILoveLoveBitconnect,i don t think it s just scared it s also that everyone knows it doesn t change anything imo peaceful protests are often ignored thus why hk escalated last year
reddit,g5z9lf,10000owls,encik arrives with book for signing extra i came out like you asked now you sign 7
reddit,g5z9lf,CheekyWanker007,but then the government allowed it to carry on before the tougher restrictions so is the government to blame here
reddit,g5z9lf,lupCheong,if the encik gangster enuff he will say come i tiak rank u not happy come lor
reddit,g5z9lf,pretentiousbrick,i think we need to arrest the inventor of bubble tea too s
reddit,g5z9lf,-_af_-,simple if there wasn t a surge in demand i think as long as people see in the app that it can be ordered how would they know that theres a surge the only time they can see is if it says that it is temporarily unavailable from the consumer viewpoint as long as the app say can order means no issue you want to get annoyed look at grab they designed the system they maintain the system they are in charge if your companies vpn cannot support all your employees logging in at the same time do you blame the users for logging in at the same time no you go after the person designing and maintaining the system
reddit,g5z9lf,tehOpengkosong,bubble tea pearls at phoon huat all sold out too lol
reddit,g5z9lf,RealArity,knee jerk reactions should have been expected people aren t going out to form clusters they re getting bubble tea independently of other customers this is pretty much the same as going out to get dinner except the number of people trying to get the same thing is higher leading to crowding also if the government had more foresight don t you think they should have eased in the restriction rather than just slapped it on without warning i understand their actions are designed to reduce transmission risks as soon as possible but the government is every bit as responsible for this yes bubble tea buyers may be irresponsible but the government by not anticipating people reacting to the new rules due to fomo is every bit as irresponsible

reddit,g5x60f,throwaway268190,yesterday they literally said in the press conference that the new tighter measures imposed will be until 4th of may after which they will review and extend if necessary how can anyone misunderstand this
reddit,g5x60f,whitetigertrainer,bigger question how about mcdonalds
reddit,g5x60f,aaronthro222,lhl clearly said this we will implement these tighter measures until 4th may but we will not be able to completely lift the restrictions after that and go back to business as usual we will therefore extend the circuit breaker for four more weeks beyond 4 may in other words until 1 june so bbt may return on 5 5 but maybe no pearls
reddit,g5x60f,p4nda13,will barbers pet stores open back on may 5 if so
reddit,g5x60f,lamercussion,it s like 10 000 spoons when all you need is a knife lol

reddit,g5x60f,pannerin,this was the case yesterday and today there was a failure in communicating that the enhanced measures are for 2 weeks for now extension of circuit breaker period 18 these tighter measures will be in place minimally for a two week period from 21 april 2020 until 4 may 2020 inclusive in view of the current situation the taskforce will also extend the circuit breaker period by another 4 weeks until 1 june 2020 inclusive we will continue to monitor the situation closely and may be able to gradually ease some of the measures if there is a significant decline in our local transmission numbers https www moh gov sg news highlights details strong national push to stem spread of covid 19

reddit,g60ydv,signofnewomega,maybe i m a out of touch 30 year old but it s literally tea with tapiocas pearls and sugar why is it so important for you to have it to live when i came out of work yesterday i saw a line even worse than the the line at ntuc at least people in ntuc hoarding can at least make the argument i m scared and want to feed my family as ludicrous as that reasoning is you can call that person hysterical and move on you at least have some noble intentions tho poorly executed or if someone is exercising for the much more tolerable reasoning of it s my daily routine i can at least respect that since you aren t gonna let the virus dictate every aspect of your life but what is the excuse for bubble tea will you get some tea withdrawal like some alcohol addicts having alcohol withdrawal this is extremely stupid and people are putting yourself in more danger than it s worth
reddit,g60ydv,boysachok,it s nice but it s not queue for 1 hour during pandemic nice
reddit,g60ydv,adrenaline_junkie88,at this point in time i try not to judge others by my own standards personally i m still doing fine income is down and life is uncertain but i have enough to tide over and don t have huge debts or problems mental emotional stuff but i do know some peers who have 2 toddlers babies at home and some have lost 1 income in a couple but they still have to buy milk food for the kids others may face abuse at home domestic abuse by partner or emotional physical abuse by family or they may just have mental issues so the bbt might be a small sense of normalcy in their lives at this time who am i to judge that said some people just want bbt for the sake of it or the sugar high those people i m not as sympathetic to
reddit,g60ydv,mookanana,are you the sort of person that will physically fight with people over hello kitty toys from mcdonalds if you aren t one of those people then no amount of explanation will help you understand their mentality same as this bubble tea thing rofl like when they announced that entertainment venues going to close so many people had a one last big party and when they started the lockdown people went out for one last meal stupid yeap but that s people

reddit,g60ydv,leilafornone,i think it s just a bad habit addiction lol for example i can live without a lot of food and drink items but i need to drink pokka iced tea every other day i bought enough to last me for 2 weeks so that i can avoid going outside because i m living with people who are high risk
reddit,g60ydv,sageadam,i don t get it either it s so not worth it to consume that much sugar from one cup of drinks i rather eat chocolate or ice cream if i m craving something sweet
reddit,g60ydv,bihoxodiy,this bubble tea craze is the second wave starting in places in the us with large asian presence like california where they call it boba and this sub culture spread through social media and made it one of the few things asians could identify with
reddit,g60ydv,testercheong,i think its either millenials or gen y or both
reddit,g60ydv,captainblackchest,best bubble tea i had was about 10 years ago during ops starlight in taiwan uncle delivered it out to our camp on a bike together with chicken cutlet that tea was phenomenal not the sugar the tea
reddit,g60ydv,deathberry_x,as an avid bbt drinker i d say it s more of habit i have friends and even a whatsapp group of colleagues who will buy bbt once or twice a week and we are people who head to the gym at least 3 times a week it s our little guilty pleasure and we try to make it not as sinful most of my friends limit it to 25 or even 0 sugar it s kind of like coffee granted if i walked down and see the whole kampung queuing for bbt i d turn back immediately also so yeah those people queuing for bbt are idiots but i empathise with the sianness of not drinking bbt for a few more weeks but also some bbt chains have really really amazing tea you can enjoy if you like tea you dont have even have to add pearls hmu if you want some recommendations for what to buy when pandemic ends
reddit,g60ydv,PierceTheVoid,i hate to admit i actually enjoy bbt but i beat system by making my own

reddit,g60ydv,GalerionTheAnnoyed,i think masks give people a sense of security so they don t feel the risk i m not a big bbt fan so i wouldn t know but i definitely did queue for 1hr on tues to cut my hair lol because i can t stand having long hair
reddit,g60ydv,backpfe1fengesicht,herp derp sweet thing in mouth herp derp
reddit,g60ydv,aerir,sugar has to be the sugar
reddit,g60ydv,FeefaPlayer,i think it s just a hyped culture and not really something enjoyed in other words most people drink bbt just because others drink it and also it s hard to believe that the same people who are apparently health conscious would like to enjoy something which is literally made up of lots of sugar or processed food here s a typical cultural contradiction i noticed among friends and colleagues traditional desserts are sweet and so unhealthy we don t want bubble tea is sweet and taste good we enjoy it
reddit,g60ydv,BubbleTeaExtraSweet,it s just like coffee to some people a quick sugar rush keeps me alive for the entire day

reddit,g60ydv,atiredanonymous,some people are annoying so they refuse to understand other party s explanations what is wrong with my comment what is the point of your comment or rather what point are you trying to make in your comment that you are very good in adding on new examples when that is not the point of op s message ignore op s message and show how good you are in adding examples is it smart sia so when will you understand that buying bbt is not as easy as because i enjoy drinking it and that would instead be contributing to the problem here
reddit,g781us,Normo_Kloppo,i have been meaning to ask this question for some time i will provide some context with my personal example some time back my girlfriend had a lucrative job offer which she received cancelled in the last minute because the company decided on hiring someone else obviously she was devastated on the same day she found out this sad news we met for a date at a bubble tea counter we were both at she kind of hinted at me to pay for the milk tea which she ordered initially i thought nothing much of it and paid but now i am starting to notice a pattern of behavior hence my question is this a common societal norm particular to singaporean girls women or a just a red flag
reddit,g781us,mhgsajj,as a female i would say it s still too early to tell for your rs it s just bbt at this point and to me it just seems she just wants some comfort from you as her bf as some sort of good thing to come out of a horrible day having received such upsetting news regarding her job but since you raised this question at this point i d say if the expectations get worse then it s a red flag also personally for myself i do expect some kind of gesture from my bf if i m having a horrible day it could be bbt yes happened before too or just sending me home via mrt or a call skype at night to talk about it etc i don t expect it to always be of monetary value but like i said it just comforts me that hey my bf is here it s not such a shitty world and yes when my bf is having a horrible day id be the one to actually spend money on him dinners movies surprise gifts or just simple hugs and kisses skype calls sending customised whatsapp stickers for a laugh etc i feel that as a so one should take the initiative to comfort or be there for them to the best of your abilities and to have an so means you can find comfort and pampering to a degree from them
reddit,g781us,TheFearlessCow,wait based on what you ve posted you just got dumped by your gf
reddit,g781us,Luc3Dio,as a woman i d have to ask if she s done this before in your relationship but if it s just bubble tea and nothing else then maybe she s just trying to find some comfort from you she could be really upset but doesn t know how to express it and if it s just a cup of bubble tea she s a keeper it s the many little things that keep relationships going not the fancy large gestures although they could be nice from time to time all the best
reddit,g781us,abgnerd,the red flag for me here is that you are keeping score the crux of your question apologies if i am mistaken here suggests that u feel u should not have to buy her gifts because her being sad is not your fault perhaps u feel that s a little unfair cos it s not your fault so u bought that bubble tea because you feel obliged to as others here have pointed out the core focus should be my gf is sad what can i do to make it better as a reflection exercise were u supportive did u guys talk about it are there other ways besides the bubble tea u could have shown u cared granted though if it becomes an expectation for either of you to expect the other to keep buying stuff for each other this might be a worrying direction relationships should be more than buying each other things finally i am just a stranger on the internet what do i know
reddit,g781us,Nimezs,it s a nice gesture but i wouldn t expect it or ask for it i can see someone getting used to it from past relationships though
reddit,g781us,choobiwoobi,no i don t but it is a nice gesture because i will also do the same if my so is sad ridiculous would be the girl asking for something expensive like gucci bag or chanel purse when she is upset
reddit,g781us,zenqian,eh op are you the one who also posted some days back of doing grocery shopping with an upset gf who just lost her lucrative internship haha anyway to answer your questions i think it will help you and your relationship if both of you understand what are your love languages for example my partner way of expressing love is via gifting so i know that buying her random tokens items food etc will perk her up
reddit,g781us,bobo_chacha,to me paying for the bubble tea isn t a big deal but the i m sad therefore you need to do x for me mentality seems really childish if someone is sad it is not the job of the so to make them happy you have your own shit to deal with emotionally healthy adults should be able to regulate their own emotions if it s a one off thing i d think nothing of it but if she does it over and over again that s a red flag
reddit,g781us,-_af_-,bro it is the small things that matter
reddit,g781us,Normo_Kloppo,i appreciate the constructive replies everyone thank you so much for your invaluable help after considering all your replies paired together with my evaluation of my relationship with her as a whole and i can reach two conclusions i i am stingy with my money only especially at times when a gift is requested of me as opposed to when i willingly give the gift to her e g i got buy her random soft toys and her favorite fruit like mangoes before ii on that day it was reasonable for her to have expected the bubble tea treat considering that she has done similar acts of service for me and the devastated state of mind she was in
reddit,g781us,_amandaz_,it depends on how long you ve been together and what was agreed upon as well as your budget financial capability if it is just bubble tea a couple of times a month let it go lor has she never reciprocated with small gifts for future reference when you re in a relationship communicate about finances it s not about whether it is your fault or not when she is sad and in fact if it is your fault it would be quite insulting to insinuate that you can make up for it by buying stuff to appease her lol
reddit,g781us,raphus,pay for one bubble tea only will burn a hole in your pocket is it
reddit,g781us,LaZZyBird,is it reciprocal does she do similar gestures to comfort you sometimes it is okay if it goes both ways any single sided giving is bound to bring resentment one day
reddit,g781us,uxersg,haha i just shared something similar from a woman s perspective knowing each other s love language is pretty important

reddit,g781us,maolyx,if she doesn t expect you to pay all the time then it shouldn t be a warning sign i think she just wanted to be comforted at that point of time
reddit,g781us,mrbearishungry2018,bbt equals gift
reddit,g781us,1moment1chance,bbt was a comfort drink to your gf at that point of time ummm i think it is totally alright to pay the bbt for her when she is upset however this should not always be the reason for her to ask for things
reddit,g781us,_Blythe,when i m sad my husband will automatically ask if he can do anything to make me feel better or he will just open the foodpanda app on his phone over the years we ve bought each other a lot of food sad or not try not to keep score of the small stuff if you end up getting married buying bbt is going to be a very small thing in the long run
reddit,g781us,melonmilkfordays,my boyfriend s quote the best way to calm down is an angry girlfriend is to feed her so who knows maybe she wanted some comforting as long as she isn t demanding like a 50 dollar gift each time she s upset and she isn t entitled about it i don t think there s anything wrong i d say something might be wrong if she isn t willing to do the same back for you if you re upset about something
reddit,g781us,fallout1942,lol no pussy is free be a man and treat ur lady sometimes if u want free use ur left or right hand
reddit,g781us,rheinl,know a guy when attend mutual friend birthday he will give so a present cause i dont want you to be without present when other pple get
reddit,g781us,Mainmito,you can t downplay it by saying its just one bbt it s a symptom of a potentially larger issue here maybe she feels like you have not been showing her enough care and concern and she is doing this to try to make you show more girls like small acts of appreciation or maybe she feels it s a way to get you to buy things for her every time she is sad in that case red flag af so perhaps you need to investigate what s the underlying issue
reddit,g781us,silentscope90210,if it s a few dollars it s ok bah
reddit,g781us,DasBiceps,she didn t ask you to buy a chanel bag or something what what s the problem
reddit,g781us,ceeayeess,sweetie it s bubble tea
reddit,g781us,leo-g,i think it s one thing to be like i m really upset can you just settle the bill will settle later when i feel better vs pay the bill coz i very upset la it s absolutely two different thing also this is her professional career it s a red flag for me
reddit,g781us,nuaforlife,nope i personally don t expect anything but if he wants to do it to console me that s fine a hug or some consoling words would be enough for me
reddit,g781us,orbiquack,this comment thumbs up precisely it s one own job to deal regulate and manage own emotions it s fine wanting to have a listening ear but she can t expect people to instantly make her feel happy she just sounds immature to me if this is not a one time thing
reddit,g781us,Jackfruitjuice,it depends on the love language of the receiving party if she s someone who equates receiving gifts with being shown love then she s not wrong in expecting that i am more of a words of affirmation person i dislike gifts because i feel tense about having to pretend i like something when i don t i place much more value on words of comfort and affection that said i do appreciate occasional small gifts like food items because that shows me that my so has been thinking of me small things like getting me a drink i like on his way home will do everyone s different now s a good time for you to learn what each of your love languages are and to assess if they re compatible
reddit,g781us,-jugjug-,it s hard to say from a stranger s pov with limited context a lot of comments are fixated on the bbt and how it s relatively cheap but you need to look at the big picture here to what extent does she rely on you or blame you when things don t go well is it a my day sucks and will only get better if you pamper me my day sucks and it s your responsibility to cheer me up those could be red flags does she hint at you to do stuff and get upset when you don t catch the hints or has she openly shared her expectations before perhaps multiple times and got upset when you didn t remember if she is angry at you for not catching hints then that s not good communication not good but can be improved on maybe it s got to do with her love language maybe hers is gifts or acts of service so things like helping to pay for her bbt means a lot to her when she s having a bad day regardless if you break up because you never pay for her bbt or never pay for her snack when you went grocery shopping dk if that post was by you then you dodged a bullet can you imagine a lifetime of trying to correctly guess whether she expects you to pay for her snacks if it s for a bigger reason and the snack paying was a small issue but happened to be the final straw then these things happen and sometimes you re just not compatible a relationship doesn t need red flags to justify ending i m replying as though you broke up based on your post history

reddit,g60rs4,Varantain,source fb dot com elfyhaikal posts 10218951606734447 this encapsulates how i felt like at ground zero today due the bubble tea shops temporarily halting businesses during this circuit breaker period as a grabfood rider 8 45pm i received order to collect bubble tea from blk 461 yishun ave 6 at that time i was actually pretty far away near to khatib mrt was actually surprised wah so far away get order there as soon as got closer i noticed a whole stretch of vehicles and bicycles and pmds and pabs so there i was at ground zero firstly it was the liho staff they were overwhelmed with non stop orders and no way to stop it from coming in there were only 2 staffs working in that outlet and over 400 cups of orders about 100 grabriders waiting there if there ever was a time when keep social distance failed it was there and then 100 riders confined to a pretty small space secondly grab itself cannot speak for deliveroo but i heard panda also has this same issue they were uncontactable the liho staffs were trying to call in to grab hotline majority of the riders there were grab riders to tell them that they were truly overwhelmed and they couldn t get through to grab thirdly the riders themselves looking for rice bowls i am pretty sure the waterway fight also is along this stance our system is pretty bad actually say we have an order we couldn t complete if we were to cancel it on our end grab will not compensate us if we were to report it basically you cancelled not our pasal however if we were to call into grab and ask them to cancel on our behalf we will be compensated for our time and effort but being uncontactable most of us really have no choice but to cancel some of us waited almost 2 hours for our orders and customers mostly refuse to cancel mine was basically teary eyed please don t cancel i don t mind waiting but to no avail cause that outlet was beginning to run out of time and ingredients so they had to close their shop at 10 50pm all other orders were rejected i think over 80 of us didn t manage to get any orders complete and since we can t contact grab we basically forfeit our efforts there 2 hours waiting no compensation end of the day everything combined to a big and epic fail on the side of singaporeans this kiasu ism have to stop bodoh peh kambing
reddit,g60rs4,pendelhaven,actually imo lah grab has to bear the responsibility isn t it the responsibility of grab to let the service outlet have the flexibility to decide whether to take in orders or not if all outlets have the capability to stop new orders you guys wouldn t have a wasted trip
reddit,g60rs4,Cactuslife95,grab seem to always become very silent when their employees aka drivers riders need them to solve problems or come up with alternatives once during the pmd saga and now this
reddit,g60rs4,willbassyeah,now use this bubble tea as an example to why covid19 is dangerous if a healthcare system is being overwhelmed too many order order unfulfilled too many patients patients cannot get healthcare support dead too many order not enough ingredients to fulfil the order too many patients need ventilators not enough ventilators dead only two staff managing as no one foresee the surge demand we got a limited number of healthcare personnel means nurses doctors need to look after more patients than normal dead stay at home and don t be stupid
reddit,g60rs4,desmuru,ah and commission wise is it better for the riders also if it is that is good to hear
reddit,g60rs4,escapelife_azzy,tdlr as someone who has been the gf rider gf customer and worked in their call centre back when grab dish out promo codes for free i feel sad for the few singaporeans who whole heartedly rely and support grab everytime i go in the fb group dedicated to gf riders i only see new videos being posted that sheds really bad impression of the riders or in general singaporeans touch your heart my dear gf riders deep down you know grab will never prioritise you in its business lol you are never their business partner you are the slave worker who has to work under the hot sun and face off the brutal honesty that is the front line service gf riders always fail to realise that their so called ricebowl will always be challenge and get eaten up by other competitors recently it was the new gc drivers surge in new riders due to many losing their main income yet grab keep pumping in more riders your incentives are gone lowered now with more skewed perceptions by the public with recent sagas do you really want to be loyal to grab on a side note yes i do still do gf once in a while but no if i want to cancel i will cancel damn your ar or cr no way in hells name will i wait for an hour for an order just because my incentives are on the line restaurant has no capacity yet taking in new orders well good bye cancelling and wait for next order oh kena ban for a while ah okay maybe can try lalamove see if there is slot or maybe i should call it a day
reddit,g60rs4,blahhh87,grab should look at how they can handle high influx of orders better it really doesn t benefit anyone including them riders and customers get pissed for waiting shop workers get overwhelmed and grab themselves have to deal with cancellation and refunds and also bad pr
reddit,g60rs4,coookiemonster123,fuck grab these problems can be easily managed if their platform is truly a value added service instead the merchants and drivers bear the brunt of grab s incompetence whilst they sit back and enjoy the surge in revenue
reddit,g60rs4,BreakWindow,the app need circuit breaker
reddit,g60rs4,maolyx,grab needs to improve their system and actually provide support
reddit,g60rs4,GeneralBarkov1983,this will continue to happen as grab csos at not based in singapore they moved operations to kl back in 2018 and from then on they dgaf anymore no surprise there grab has been a letdown the moment they bought out uber it s just an abysmal service used to work at grab and also worked as a part time grabfood delivery rider saw the writing on the wall a long time ago they had a fantastic team handling the call centre here in singapore but obviously they wanted to cut cost and move to malaysia where the team there had basically no experience working in call centres or even dispute resolutions
reddit,g60rs4,raymmm,at the end of the day if they don t regulate themselves the government will be forced to regulate them if the situation keep getting out of hand imo pretty myopic of their management to keep whatever short term gain and end up losing big long term if the government end up being overzealous at regulating them after all the bicycle sharing regulations and pmd regulations they still don t get that their business can end at an instance if things get out of hand
reddit,g60rs4,kopibot,https help grab com merchant en sg 360027910551 temporarily pausing new orders hmmm
reddit,g60rs4,roamingphantom,afaik a few days ago grab still have their bubble tea subscriptions thing and now it s gone they used to rely on bbt drinkers
reddit,g60rs4,jacksh2t,it seems like they will auto help you turn back on after a set period of time how the heck is a shop with two bubble tea employees gonna manage that especially when there can instantly be 100 orders of 4 drinks each
reddit,g60rs4,KaiXenoEh,should have implemented some sort of inventory system when i asked about the tools given by grab for this scheme with my grandma just a year ago luckily we didn t fall through with the plan due to operational cost
reddit,g60rs4,mercuryjamiealice,unsure about grab and deliveroo but back as a panda cyclist i recall that we never were able to see who or what the order details pick up order and drop off were until we accepted it and if we didn t we would get a call from msia hq it was stressful af cause i worked central and constantly rode distances that should have been covered by other vehicles my longest was from douby to orchard to keppel are oh and if the order was cancelled we didn t get squat
reddit,g60rs4,throw39284725,the grab rider can choose to cancel the order on their end sure they lose out on the commission of the order but it beats waiting in line for 2 hours
reddit,g60rs4,diceybubbles,could this be because grab has alrd processed the payment and hence must fulfil the order the concept of a payment or transaction is to exchange money for services rendered in situations like delivery the transaction can only be completed by delayed fulfilment and since payment has already been processed grabfood must fulfil their role the reason for payment which is to pass the order to the third party bbt shop in this case to fulfil and upon that completion pass to the grabfood rider to deliver to the payer thereby completing grab s end of the transaction grab should have further control over every step to refund if cannot be completed at various stages seemingly not built into their platform for completeness of argument and to provide my own counter thesis i would also like to add that while we should all be kind to grab and understand that such a situation may be unforeseen we are in unprecedented times after all this excuse is unacceptable for a company that can build surge pricing but not a way for third parties to manage their own incoming orders interested to hear other opinions
reddit,g60rs4,zeratul123x,thanks zoomers you re just as bad as the people hoarding at least what they re doing has some merit they want to make sure their family has enough supplies and what not you all just want to satisfy your selfish craving tell me more about how much better you are than the covidiots
reddit,g60rs4,phycle,don t care for bbt but for example before announcing closure of gyms they should have allowed enough time for shops to stock up on home gym equipment
reddit,g60rs4,qwerty198317,there is but if u are the merchant who will be out of business for another 6weeks what would u do last chance to get some money screw the app screw the delivery screw the walk in crowd screw the person at home waiting for orders this happened to ding tai feng short of staff promo for the food all the delivery guys got screwed waiting cancel and u get punished wait for two hours and your income is down cancel the job and u get another job immediately from the same shop because your app is on autoaccept mode call helpdesk to cancel for u but they put u on indefinite loops to wear your patience so delivery guys all get triggered that night so much public backlash on the delivery guys what criminals ah beng low ses attitude problem but have u wondered why they are doing this job why they chose to make their money queuing 1hr its hard work honest living they could have opted to steal rob peddle drugs all much easier money but they all chose to make an honest decent living through hard work its an easy job but to do something like peddling a bike for 10hrs everyday give them a break be kinder with your criticism
reddit,g60rs4,InterimNihilist,that s the beauty of the gig model when there s money to be made grab controls the cash flow but when there are operational issues you can t grab anyone from the company
reddit,g60rs4,Sputniki,what nonsense out of all the jobs available on the planet they picked grab and you say they don t have a choice
reddit,g60rs4,SamBellFromSarang,actually this raises a good secondary point when life is good we all laugh and say wah deliverman can earn so much good ah let s all also sign up soon as it all burns down we go at grab s throat and yell at them for being morons
reddit,g60rs4,musr,simplest solution is to allow each shop outlet two things set maximum orders in queue at any one time adjustable in app big red stop button also in app
reddit,g60rs4,adognow,grab is hemorrhaging investor money which is why they re cutting corners on everything the business model is to hope to monopolize the market before they stop being able to raise cash being able to retrospectively cancel orders that would not be able to be fulfilled should be a thing given the shittiness of their app but that would of course mean lost revenue grab has absolutely zero fucking corporate social responsibility whatsoever but that s hardly surprising since the term itself is some pr bullshit that doesn t actually exist this being unable to get through to grab cso problem has been a really longstanding complaint and the rider buildup during an ongoing pandemic as a result of grab s deliberate abdication of responsibilities to garner revenue should be investigated under the infectious disease act as a matter of fact start investigating the ceo you can bet how fast shit will turn around
reddit,g60rs4,jamesinsights,other platforms haven t been charging super high service fees also foodpanda deliveroo have more reasonable fees
reddit,g60rs4,yeeez1,yeah i believe they changed it after integrating grabfood into their main app the old merchant app allowed merchant to select their estimated prep time a hybrid method would be best imo during the day when supply of riders is sufficient the foodpanda deliveroo system of pinging riders near pickup time would be best for efficiency late at night say 11pm 7am when there s v few riders on the road the grab system would ensure someone would collect the order thus cutting down on potential wastage but that s also the most technically difficult to implement
reddit,g60rs4,Quish_,hard truths right here the company talks about how these riders and drivers are the backbone of the company all a load of pr and bs
reddit,g60rs4,INSYNC0,essentially it s supply and demand it has been that way since the past and will always be that way the upside of this is there are people who are able to rake in 7000 a month the downside if theres a large influx of riders it s for sure that your 7000 will be lowered and does gf care about that nope because they still get their same cut of the pie
reddit,g60rs4,stridered,temporary pausing does nothing to the orders already auto accepted
reddit,g60rs4,L23846,grab only hold the order amount until delivery is completed
reddit,g60rs4,Varantain,could this be because grab has alrd processed the payment and hence must fulfil the order no normal businesses aren t obliged to fulfill orders even if payment has been made look at the many cases of pricing mistakes https www singaporelawblog sg blog article 65 of course as grab controls the platform they are free to penalise either the store or consumer as they see fit and the most straightforward way for them to settle any dispute is to say that they re banned from using our platform this is why grab should never be allowed to dominate a market and why more people should support smaller operators those that aren t deliveroo foodpanda
reddit,g60rs4,theloneranger_55,are you implying that the government should announce the latest measures a week in advance so as to allow bbt drinkers to buy a stockpile to keep at home for the duration of the circuit breaker is bbt a source of vital essential nutrients like rice meat and vegetables that it is necessary to give people time to prepare
reddit,g60rs4,AtreiaDesigns,bubble tea encompasses a whole lot of different drinks some enjoy stuff like peach green tea or macchiato drinks you may not like it but to generalize all bubble tea as worse than teh tarik is honestly childish and uncalled for if i crave creamy taiwan milk tea teh tarik will never be able to satisfy that craving still singaporeans mostly panic and go crazy over mainstream hype stuff which is why mcdonalds hello kitties were being fought for
reddit,g60rs4,HazyNightz,nope they simply cannot do that there s no such option on grab platform for the outlets
reddit,g60rs4,frumperino,this reflects a critical lack of flow monitoring in these systems over simplistic models for orders with no built in threshold alarms or throttle automation just watching the rate of backlogged orders growing should be a good decision basis for an automatic alarm to trigger
reddit,g60rs4,ryuuheii,then grab can institute a system to limit the number of orders that can come in to a shop or better yet let the shop control it limit the number of orders quantity value that can be ordered active at a time grab just doesn t want to do so because they want to force the restaurants hand into taking as many delivery orders and they don t care as the operational fall out only screws over the restaurant and riders but not grab
reddit,g60rs4,AyysforOuus,pausing is not enough they need to be able to pause and cancel or accept orders whenever they want shouldn t it be common sense that the shop needs to accept the order before assigning a rider
reddit,g60rs4,milo_dino,smth smth independent contractors
reddit,g60rs4,sct_trooper,because it is the responsibility of the company i dont praise my company everytime they pay my salary but should they fail to do so im definitely reporting to mom moreover grab is the one holding the information and with the means to implement control measures the onus is definitely on them
reddit,g60rs4,FishyPower,are you saying that we can displace all these grab workers into another suitable job overnight there is a decent amount of jobs created by these delivery services someone would have to take it up just because you and i are in the situation where we can be picky doesn t mean we should pretend that that s the case for everyone else
reddit,g60rs4,nekosake2,grab is a monopoly they are not incentivized to do any sort of advancement or qol for their own systems
reddit,g60rs4,bigzij,well in my opinion why is there such a huge dependency on grab or for it to change their system sure you re right that it has happening more and more in the past few weeks their system can always be improved but the grab partners they had the option of not working with grab there s alternatives or you can just not engage food delivery tech services the customers also want the luxury of not queuing not going to buy food and want these services at a cheap affordable price they don t want to wait too long too the grab delivery riders they want to earn income at their own time they re afraid to cancel orders in fear of their ratings or whatnot everyone is just trying to make a quick buck live life and as i ve said grab probably isn t even profitable yet especially in the grabfood aspect to me it just seems like people hating on other people yet all are in the same sinking ship could grab have an improved system yes but are they purely at fault if they didn t have a function for partners to not accept orders couldn t the riders call it an early day or just cancel what s there to be said about customers who knowingly try to get orders when these vendors are so packed i m just thinking there s lessons to be learnt and ways we can all improve ourselves on in these situations the sooner we acknowledge that we shouldn t always point and let one party solely bear the brunt of responsibility the sooner we can progress as a society just my opinion
reddit,g60rs4,Spaiduhz,i propose a third option rider goes offline goes home sucks for merchants who are able to fulfill orders but riders not being allocated because of the bbt bs
reddit,g60rs4,MisterPlagueDoctor,soooooo a circuit breaker bahahah
reddit,g60rs4,Intentionallyabadger,omg it doesn t take a pandemic for a huge influx of orders to happen
reddit,g60rs4,Harmoniinus,used to work and pack for grabfood orders i just don t get why it is an auto accept system i know the delivery system operates according to our operating hours but the only way to not accept order is to pause the delivery though pausing is faster glitches do happen when we want to do so due to that we often had to turn off every single menu item manually there are times while turning off the menu item order still comes in calling back grab to cancel the order that had food items that we were still trying to close is very troublesome i hope this whole ordeal that have been going on the past few days is enough to introduce better changes to the delivery system if the other two delivery platforms can at least have the accept reject button i don t see why grab can t input one
reddit,g60rs4,tongzhimen,precisely notice that they don t even bother coming out to mediate between drivers and merchants when there s a conflict but when there s a threat to their bottom line recent merchants complaining about grab s up to 30 cut their pr machine goes into overgear to explain why they deserve such a big cut for doing fuck all
reddit,g60rs4,journeyman1998,when they design their apps they probably never thought that there will be such a situation i mean who will predict a pandemic and a lockdown i think even after this the app won t have such feature since it s once in a decade thing
reddit,g60rs4,IHaveAProblemLa,they don t get paid till they fulfilled the orders unlike standard ecomm business plus the post you are replying to is criticising grab the mnc valued in the billions not the delivery people
reddit,g60rs4,jbjbjbjbjb12,that s interesting yeah the hybrid model you described make sense but also definitely sounds like something that will take time to implement haha would be interesting to see if any of the delivery companies do that eventually
reddit,g60rs4,justtosavestuffhere,that s true i am probably underestimating the amount of orders that can come in at the same time before the restaurant realises they need to pause imo they should let the restaurants manually accept orders then they can manage the load themsleves
reddit,g60naf,CarbonoAtom,so basically its week 1 of cb most of the stores are over crowded and to do my part to prevent over crowding in these supermarkets i ordered food online however this is where things went horribly wrong i probably chose the wrong hypermarket provider to issue my delivery here is what went wrong x200b initially i thought maybe the delivery of groceries and packages would be like how your orders from shopee or lazada come that the items are reserved before being delivered however this is not the case for orders which stem from giant it is packed the day before you order the item so for example with something that is scarce in todays hypermarkets lets say err tapioca starch with all the bubble tea shops which have closed yesterday you place the order on the item immediately coz super high demand and the delivery date is stipulated to be next week monday the way their logistics work is that instead of reserving the items from their warehouse they would get people to collect the items fairprice uses a hybrid of this system and packs before time the day before you place the order from their physical stores this then goes to their delivery fleet and then gets sent to your home this means that if the item is not available n 4 days after you placed a valid order along w the delivery fee you would be informed the very evening before the delivery the next day that items x y z are now unavailable and the best part of this experience is their customer support after inquiring with them the customer support team with regards to this issue my dude just told me that just shop at places other than giant if i want quality service and deliveries on time x200b rant sorry for the rant but i think that people should know where they are getting their groceries from in the event that the supermarkets are very crowded note im not blaming our essential workers but the logistics management excluding the customer service agents who probably received multiple calls like mine and made them even more sian annoyed because of the rudeness that one person emanated in the phone call and do not be surprised if many of your items just disappear off your delivery notice haha when you re expecting a shipment from them x200b x200b tl dr i guess in this current situation please try not to use the delivery system provided by giant because it has a very big logical flaw in the mechanism that they deliver goods to the end user use alternative grocery partners such as fairprice or sheng siong redmart amazon instead x200b x200b edit my friend got her fairprice order on her first try that s why i thought fairprice probably used a better system i have also used redmart and their end works pretty well when it comes to this too haha but this is super infuriating to the end user especially when there is no conformation with regards to the orders
reddit,g60naf,Haunting-Owl,lol so true it s kinda like playing russian roulette with your grocery order
reddit,g60naf,worldcitizensg,well i had the same with lazada redmart multiple times and especially with the fresh produce guess it s something beyond today s technology or business case
reddit,g60naf,zyrapenguin,welcome to online grocery shopping in singapore your experience is not specific to giant basically all the other main grocery chains are like this for online orders and deliveries logistics and system are really bad compared to how it can be how it is elsewhere things were already of mediocre and uncertain quality before the cb and then the cb just put additional strain on an already problematic and badly supported system picking packing items on the day of delivery doesn t need to mean that it s down to luck as to which items on the order will necessarily arrive other places pick pack on the day of delivery and still manage to fulfill the orders without missing items but that s how it is in singapore hopefully this will motivate grocery delivery services to improve then again not sure if they will they all basically have a comfortable oligopoly now but change probably won t happen that soon all i can say is i feel your pain s
reddit,g60naf,failedretirementplan,this miracle has never happened for me and i have been ordering many many times from ntuc
reddit,g60naf,youg,it was my first online order from fairprice heeheehee beginner s luck
reddit,g60naf,Deecoas,i tested both giant and fairprice last week same thing happened with giant and was very disappointed but i guess they re doing their best i got all items ordered from fairprice and manage to get a slot the next day for giant earlierst time they offered was like the next week previously it could also be because giant gives free delivery service at a lower price mark i think it s hard for the person handling all the calls and complaints they are receiving although they aren t the ones who lacked many customers probably call them like you may be cut then some slack for now
reddit,g60naf,Achro,in my experience the online grocers sorted in order from most missing products to least missing products redmart or giant rm can wildly vary depending on demand if you ordered from 3rd party sellers from 70 missing items like during sudden spikes in demand to 0 missing later in the same week their facebook page is always swarmed with complaints about missing items and unlike some retailers you have to manually request refunds giant always has lots of missing stuff cb or not eamart also recently they sent an email saying they have staff shortages due to pickers being stuck in malaysia not enough drivers for suppliers so on cold storage or fairprice surprisingly the amount of missing items before and after cb is the same they didn t get any worse for me prime now sg in 2 years i have had only 1 missing item from the local 2 hour delivery service even during cb
reddit,g60naf,ChoiceScarfMienfoo,i experienced the same issues with iceland and waitrose deliveries when i lived in the uk though like my frozen seafood orders that are more popular would always be oos and i d get a refund instead so i don t think it s a local grocery store issue but more of a delivery issue
reddit,g60naf,Practical-Library,this is the way all grocery stores do deliveries pickups i believe due to issues of not having storage for cold frozen produce and also to decrease the chance of you not receiving fresh items i mean i wouldn t want broccoli picked 4 days ago to be delivered to me lol having worked in the food industry too i can assure you it is also a logistical nightmare if you re holding picked orders for like 3 4 days out i was doing walmart pickups like crazy just before i came back and i often will get a substitution or cancellation notice only a few hours before even when i did other pickups it was the same with the only exception being target but only because they do not do fresh picking so everything can hang out in their back room until you pick it up
reddit,g60naf,CarbonoAtom,haha f i really think they should change the methodology of packing the items because if they use this to do all deliveries then consumers would instead go to online retailers such as amazon redmart redman for baking instead of the grocery stores what this also incentives us is to go there physically because if it is packed on the same day its the same as you going down there and taking the items yourself to be delivered back to your house x200b just my two cents on this
reddit,g5xegk,autistic_penguin_kai,i ve been thinking about it for some time now ever since they announced the closure of all entertainment venues i myself went to play at the arcade one last time and even eat out one last time before the circuit breaker period officially started to be fair i noticed that everyone s just concerned about the crowding issue due to potential of new clusters forming there s no wrong in wanting to get your last cup of boba tea for a while but there are valid concerns for crowding it s understandable for people on social media to voice out their concerns about the crowding issue but then there s facebook comments literally going don t drink bubble tea for awhile will die is it which i find uncalled for and rude it s natural for people to want to enjoy something for a while before it closes temporarily i m not going to defend anyone but whatever happens is each individual s responsibility i guess cheers
reddit,g5xegk,paper_boxes,which makes the one last time mentality the root issue no
reddit,g5xegk,Stripey7676,every action needs to be evaluation in light of the circumstances they are not inseparable generally we say exercise is healthy but exercising while having pneumonia is not context is everything the bbt crowd s one last time has been judged in light of cb measures and found wanting
reddit,g5xegk,ballsie995,the one last time is not a problem in itself it is a problem when it is everyones one last time this is with respect to game theory or prisoner dilemma
reddit,g5xegk,Lopn4sive,it s understandable for people on social media to voice out their concerns about the crowding issue but then there s facebook comments literally going don t drink bubble tea for awhile will die is it which i find uncalled for and rude why care about such opinions just because it might be a popular opinion doesn t mean it is more right
reddit,g5xegk,nooooblet,cause and effect i guess you should join the group of people who decided to close the bbt shops then since you can t see that the effect is a result of the mentality
reddit,g5xegk,player9818,what is your points here
reddit,g5xegk,Reddeator,duh
reddit,g5xegk,backpfe1fengesicht,dude it s the one last time mentality that s making people doing that thing one last time kudos if you have the self control to not do it but that s the exception
reddit,g5xegk,autistic_penguin_kai,i lack self control to stay away from the one last time thoughts myself and kind of wish i went to get some koi yesterday apparently there s exceptions everywhere online though
reddit,g5ius5,HeavyArmsJin,groceries at least can say is buy for family queuing 1 hour for bbt is risking your family s life just to satisfy 15 minutes of your tastebuds young people can no longer complaint about old folks because they ve demonstrated that they are not only more selfish but also doesn t have any self control and foresight despite being supposedly much more educated and news savvy compared to their older counterparts x200b yea i one pole wack the whole boat people hahaha
reddit,g5ius5,cigsandbooze,to get the gao ness you need to use those grinded tea leaves if you re using those regular tea bags then you ll need to use around 3 tea bags to 1 cup of bbt
reddit,g5ius5,kuurosaki,agreed at least panic buying by boomers is done in the interest of the family s wellbeing but youngsters queuing for bbt is purely a selfish decision to satisfy one s cravings
reddit,g5ius5,thattragedy,yeah don t think i ll ever understand what s so special about bubble tea its nice lah but its not something i ll drink everyday
reddit,g5ius5,AriesAscending,i am being sarcarstic hahahaha isn t 3 dots the international indication of sarcasm edit i also realised the original comment has been deleted so it makes no sense now d
reddit,g5ius5,precipiceblades,this virus is a great equaliser lol now boomers and young ones are no different from each other
reddit,g5ius5,shibiwan,still have mine even after 25 years away makes things easier if you need to come back for emergencies
reddit,g5ius5,Ljh31,honestly disgusted and embarrassed by their actions lol then when community case surge again people start complaining make noise and say all kinds of stupid thing
reddit,g5ius5,Xylorios,it s called sugar addiction
reddit,g5ius5,depetir,sigh we complained that boomers are irrational and unhygenic but people my age are not much better why are we like this
reddit,g5ius5,satowa,glad to see someone point this out it s really really not a necessity at all and it s only for a month or so not a permanent ban or anything like that kinda scary how people are addicted to it i m sorry but i genuinely cannot emphatize well i m glad that at least an amount of single use plastics and straws will be saved while all these bbt shops are closed also the amount of people who queued for bbt probably provided enough savings for these businesses to survive a month without working
reddit,g5ius5,Radflagindicator,yeah agree there should be a threshold built into the system because it happened at night i think grab also didn t have enough staff to manually override deal with order cancellations too
reddit,g5ius5,wastedrice,i read the downvoted comments at the bottom by people trying to justify their last minute queuing for bubble tea and they are just at best a desperate act of mental gymnastics to rationalize their own selfishness quite impressive really the lengths people will go to especially with all the healthcare workers working hard in the hospitals to reduce the strain on our healthcare system and then we have all these people threatening to create a cluster either at the bbt store or in their own family it would be interesting to hear more from the people who think they have some sort of valid reason as to why going out to queue last minute for bbt at night is not covidiot behaviour anyone let s hear your reasons as to why you re not a selfish and short sighted person with no ability to self reflect
reddit,g5ius5,spacepotatocat,if the cb extends beyond 1st june because of these idiots i m going to be so fucking mad lol
reddit,g5ius5,throwaway29u82,i feel a great disturbance in the force as if millions of bubble tea fans suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly deprived i fear something terrible has happened
reddit,g5ius5,xShots,who would have thought the hidden clusters would be a crowd of bbt idiots
reddit,g5ius5,Haninumber1,make ownself lah now youtube also can teach you cook boba
reddit,g5ius5,FeefaPlayer,there s nothing to disagree with the op just within a few hours yesterday young people at bbt shops have proven that they can do much worse than boomers at fairprice it s also a good indicator for foreseeing any potential problems in re opening shops for example shops like mcdonald s will think twice before re opening the shops without extra rules or caution now they know the potential danger of what hoarding young people can do
reddit,g5ius5,jurafalle,my favourite then was quickly s lemon ice blended it was literally already blended in the freezer and they just scoop it into the cup wow tastes better than auntie annie s lemonade
reddit,g5ius5,runesplease,boomer v zoomer both loser
reddit,g5ius5,Normo_Kloppo,millenials these days they really need to be taught better by modern parents why increase the risk of transmission by queuing for some drink with balls inside lol
reddit,g5ius5,DevilDjinn,orrrrrr maybe we could not stoop to their level and do unto others as you would have them do unto you
reddit,g5ius5,show-up,this is actually a quality post upvote
reddit,g5ius5,BetterCallPaul4,ironic they could stop others from behaving irresponsibly but not themselves
reddit,g5ius5,mookanana,they need whacking in real life with a real bamboo pole in the face unless they chiobu then tap on ass
reddit,g5ius5,SG15928,judging other people s action is even more xia suay yes including me judging you
reddit,g5ius5,TarneyBinston,if you realistically look at the risk involved with both queuing for groceries and bbt both cases pose equivalent minimal risk when social distancing is properly adopted in the process of purchasing however there is no chance in gods green earth that a rational government would announce an islandwide ban on groceries therefore the act of hoarding groceries is pointless in the case of bubble tea the government has confirmed the closure of bubble tea stores hence it is justifiable why there d be a queue in the case of groceries not so much plus hoarding groceries adversely affects poorer households and older folk that are unable to contest for household essentials queueing for bubble tea has no effect of this sort making hoarding groceries a relatively more deplorable act the real shitshow is the self righteous fucks like op that bitch and moan when people live their own lives sure they may catch covid 19 today but guess what if you stay at home there s no risk of you getting so what s the fuss if they caught covid19 in the queue by the time they exhibit symptoms it ll still be 4 weeks til cb ends so the figures at that stage will be still irrelevant to the decision to open the economy up or not plus my guess is that the economic fallout of a 2 month cb would be so painful the government would not extend this bullshit for any longer at least not in an election year
reddit,g5ius5,backpfe1fengesicht,we learn from our elders here s to being better elders when our time comes
reddit,g5ius5,caulfieldguy,we queued last week for bbt in clayton shops close to monash university its not embarrassing it s an attempt to connect with something normal and delicious only one customer allowed in at a time so we waiting on the street all good
reddit,g5ius5,ZehzehHerePain,firstly dude calm your tits no need to swell over this secondly a cup of bbt can easily cost 5 10dollars thats easily 2 3meals for some that s the hourly rate of some jobs i have never drank bbt unless they have 1for1 promos or there are free vouchers coupon promos it would be a waste if you cant claim it thankfully i got the foresight and went to claim my free desert at my fav desert stall the moment i heard the dishonorable son is going to give a speech else the stamps on my rewards card would go to waste as it expires in june heng ar noone when i go there also took the opportunity to buy groceries so my parents won t need to risk getting wuhan at the supermarket lastly i am not interested in debating with you about watever hype train or the bunch of gibberish you are spouting just stating a possible reason
reddit,g5ius5,Patzer1234,trust me spend 2 weeks wearing a rf shielding cap and you will feel the difference all our govt s manipulative actions be cum super clear it makes sense if you make your population stupid it will be easier to keep them stupid peace and jesus loves you
reddit,g5ius5,colddeadplace,hmm 1 you speak of the loss of freedom and boredom and that drinking bbt has been a way to alleviate that for these people i think that applies to a few rather than the majority 2 my view is that it s largely fomo this has been exacerbated by social media and our increased connectedness hysteria is exteremely easy to fuel heck a few days ago everyone was posting their final macs delivery rip macs sadfaceemoji etc this hits every generation with some in each generation responding differently some of us are able to disconnect some of us are hit stronger you re right in that there s no justification for it but yeah it does help us understand why this happens and perhaps in the future policy makers can better prepare for this
reddit,g5ius5,dizzyluo,you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the boomer
reddit,g5ius5,chickencheesepie,honestly the supermarket queues weren t boomers either it s us on social media that are the certified idiots
reddit,g5ius5,DuePomegranate,ikea toys r us popular pre cb buying was taking risks to obtain materials that would be useful throughout the cb period one last bubble tea is just a fleeting moment of pleasure
reddit,g5ius5,coolbakerguy97,haven t had bbt in over 8 months now still not dead
reddit,g5ius5,purplepopx3,yeah it s a nice treat i get maybe once a week or whenever i m feeling down but not a necessity
reddit,g5ius5,ashleytjy,same i don t understand the hype of bbt
reddit,g5ius5,signofnewomega,tbh bubble tea isn t even that good it s pack full of sugar and flavoring i much rather get a tea bag and water and chuck it in a freezer cheaper and sustainable you no need to go out every day to satisfy your sweet tooth for 20 minutes
reddit,g5ius5,singaporeing,one people one nation
reddit,g5ius5,doesnotcompuke,i use whipping cream and lots of sugar it s disgusting but it does tastes like bbt

reddit,g5ius5,autonomy_girl,lol where were all you self righteous people in all those ok boomer and anti elderly threads i did my fair bit chastising people for blaming elderly people but i didn t see so many people being morally superior in those threads
reddit,g5ius5,xRadec,you re getting down voted because you re an idiot
reddit,g5ius5,_amandaz_,they have higher risks through direct contact with patients and in spite of ppe there are quite a few medical workers contractors that have tested positive for covid19 what are you even going on about
reddit,g5ius5,redditor_here,i guess we found one xiasuay idiot that went to queue for bbt
reddit,g5ius5,bryanvlo,on the way to get bbt you could infect other people or be infected than pass it to your family it s always been about vectors of transmission to the community do all those young people live alone in singapore where young home ownership is low probably not
reddit,g5ius5,Stripey7676,your thinking is the reason why we have extended cb
reddit,g5ius5,tartetan,your comment is so tasteless and lacks so much tact that it s baffling young people most likely live with older people the chances of these people with families that have immunocompromised people more likely than you think the fact that until now people like you still haven t wake up your bloody idea and realise that if people fucking die there won t be an economy for you to run there won t be an economy because guess what everyone is sick or dead you got look at america anot the sheer amount of cases that keep stacking up every day because they die die want to open up economy dude this is a pandemic it s not time for us to focus on money yall are so fucking hard to please government put in effort and show that they re trying yall don t like government don t do shit you also don t like use some critical thinking please it s not that hard
reddit,g5ius5,blackreplica,ok you re definitely trolling please ignore my earlier comment no one is that fucking stupid lol
reddit,g5ius5,Desmous,i guess that s reasonable but you re still part of a minority personally i could never see myself going there for food because it s so far away and it s pretty expensive for 1 meal cai png and ikea meatballs are the same in your stomach anyway

reddit,g5ius5,vaderstark,lmao no one is swelling over this great flex about your foresight although i think no one wants to know about your political views head over to edmw for that kinda content ps it s dessert
reddit,g5ius5,TheHippoGuy69,nope that s probably the best way they could have handled it if they give one more day as a grace period instead of long queues for in a roughly 4 hour timespan we would have long queues in like one entire day everywhere will be flooded if grace period or pre warning is given
reddit,g5ius5,redryder74,wasn t the ikea meatballs thing debunked

reddit,g5ius5,fibbermeister,your body is moving but your soul your soul may be dead
reddit,g5ius5,mantism,by now it s not hype any more it has stayed for far too long for just a food trend and has already become part of our culture bbt was already around early 2000s iirc the industry was revived somewhere during 2010 2013 when koi started becoming mainstream and similar chains started popping up so you now have people who potentially have been regularly drinking bubble tea between 2000 and 2020 which is a lot of people some of them they literally grew up with bubble tea of course that doesn t excuse this behaviour
reddit,g5ius5,Nikansm,i think sweet talk has always been the more neighbourhood option so you don t really see them at the big malls

reddit,g5ius5,zyrapenguin,actually 90s not even early 2000s
reddit,g5ius5,Tragic16,short answer yes
reddit,g5ius5,HeavyArmsJin,i think 90 of the food we eat nowadays have some form of sugar added in
reddit,g5ius5,Eifand,the article is citing a study that showed sugar has similar effect on the brain as cocaine drug like effects a review published in the british journal of sports medicine has claimed that refined sugar has a similar effect on the brain as illegal drugs such as cocaine in studies on rats it has been found that there are significant similarities between eating sugar and drug like effects such as bingeing craving tolerance withdrawal dependence and reward the research scientists claim that sugar alters mood and can induce reward and pleasure in the same way drugs such as cocaine affect the brain they cite studies in rats where sugar was preferred to cocaine and studies in mice where the mice experienced sugar withdrawal symptoms https www newhallhospital co uk news is sugar more addictive than cocaine https www newhallhospital co uk news is sugar more addictive than cocaine
reddit,g5ius5,potatetoe_tractor,it s a waste of money if it expires secondly a cup of bbt can easily cost 5 10dollars thats easily 2 3meals for some that s the hourly rate of some jobs erm rule no 1 about coupons and discounts you save the most by not buying anything even if the item is going for 50 off also if something like bbt is gonna be a relatively huge expense for one s budget one should not even consider buying bbt in the first place finally if you want to talk bigger picture alternate pov stuff is bbt even a necessity

reddit,g5fe64,Aesen_1,i m not justifying it don t get me wrong i m not arguing that buying bbt at 10pm is a good thing what i m hoping to explain is that the issues behind hoarding and mass bbt queues are quite different both are problems but it s good to know the difference behind these problems
reddit,g5fe64,momo00roro,bye zoomers cue r ghanasaysgoodbye

reddit,g5fe64,edwin989,it does look like a gay drink
reddit,g5fe64,wastedrice,yeah so your argument is that hoarding food is bad that s true what you ve said but you haven t addressed why going out at 10pm to queue in the crowd for bbt is a good thing please tell me more i want to know how you justify this
reddit,g5fe64,Shuyi000,seriously the intention behind hoarders are much more noble
reddit,g5fe64,phycle,remember not to touch your face
reddit,g5fe64,InTheSunrise,bubble tea is just addictive i used to love bubble tea until one of my relative had to amputate her leg from type 2 diabetes no love anymore since then
reddit,g5fe64,adognow,sweet things are probably addictive it has been hard to definitively prove that sugar is addictive per se and the interference of industrial lobbying groups just muddies the question but there is a lot of circumstantial evidence pointing in that direction there has been an animal study that suggests that sugar is more addictive than cocaine but there was some controversy behind the methodology with some of it likely from industrial lobbying a good solution is still a sugar tax at the very best it prods industries in the right direction to find alternatives at the very worst it makes people with poor impulse control pay a fairer share for healthcare but as a personal anecdote i noticed that when malaysia introduced their sugar tax coca cola and the other soft drink corporations started offering steep discounts on artificially sweetened drinks coke zero and all that most likely to entice buyers to switch over to sugar free alternatives rather than cut down purchases on sugar laden beverages
reddit,g5fe64,Fellinlovewithawhore,and no mcdonalds
reddit,g5fe64,yellowtofuwarrior,don t you dare insult trash at least it s free the price of some bubble teas can buy 2 chicken rice
reddit,g5fe64,Whiskerfield,very easy what just inform the retailers and outlets to stop selling immediately the government just have to inform registered businesses in their databases that they consider non essential much easier than informing the public who can be told later in an official announcement

reddit,g6fley,phycle,choy
reddit,g6fley,ProfundaMaro,this is what grab is doing wrong when the app says store is preparing your order but there s no rider assigned yet the store does not know about the order at all so i guess this goes well most of the time but when a surge happens and a store wants to pause grab should cancel those orders that are waiting for a rider too i am wondering if this is a setting tho for some restaurants you have to wait quite a bit for waiting for restaurant to confirm your order while others go through immediately
reddit,g6fley,LuciferBiscuit,but it s a fucking long wait tho and the rider knows it s a fucking long wait too
reddit,g6fley,ToeBlisters,possibly the staffs were overran with orders the riders lost their patience waiting for their orders everyone is just 1 strand of hair away from exploding

reddit,g6fley,nongnongdongfongbong,it s easy to see the playmade staff s comment as the only trigger for the grabfood rider s outburst but i doubt that s the case one possibility is that the grabfood rider has had a long stressful day dealing with troublesome customers and perhaps even grabfood management all that pent up frustration needs only the smallest perceived slight to get ignited what i m saying is panic bubble tea buyers are indefensible and should be made to deliver food for a month as community service

reddit,g6fley,belmont_lay,source i was in q for weekly boba purchase for the whole fam at 5ish so your source is anecdotal sorry if i don t consider it reliable and if the wait time was indeed 1 hour it s likely that the staff were way too fucking busy to look at the grab terminal and notice the torrent of orders coming in so your point is they should have paused it later after the proverbial dam is already non existent your reading comprehension ah my point is that the grab pause for merchants isn t effective in situations like that hitting the temporary pause button doesn t clear orders in the system the staff at the outlet are the ones who can hit the pause not some playmade ceo playmade also supposedly tried calling grab yep the staff at the outlet supposedly did just like you supposedly were in the queue at 5ish edit https www reddit com r singapore comments g60rs4 a_grabfood_riders_perspective_on_how_grab this grab driver s account of what happened at a different bubble tea store but similar situation on the same day secondly grab itself cannot speak for deliveroo but i heard panda also has this same issue they were uncontactable the liho staffs were trying to call in to grab hotline majority of the riders there were grab riders to tell them that they were truly overwhelmed and they couldn t get through to grab i m guessing like other reported incidents the pause button wasn t working for some reason and orders were still going through

reddit,g6fley,Harmoniinus,idk if you ve handled grab orders before but sometimes the pause button really glitch and you have to manually off each items even while you are switching off the menu items orders can still come in since grab is auto accept with no reject or accept option you want to cancel you have to call there s no other way but how to cancel if grab don t even pick up your calls as it is overflooded with other calls too

reddit,g5ctmy,Myrmidas,but in your previous post you were calling for more things to close down going back to the topic of bbt i will give you an example of how a simple non essential thing like bubble tea can cause severe impact a child struggling to adjust to all the lockdown changes limitations to playtime lack of social life having high energy but no where to spend has been throwing tantrums since day 1 of cb parents tried to make the experience slightly more positive by giving him something to look forward to bubble tea now that give parents a method to help the child cope with the difficult time then you remove bubble tea and parents are back to square one trying to help the child adjust to the restrictions while dealing with their own challenges as working adults what is non essential to you may be essential to someone else maybe those people walking around just need some breather to cope with everything that is happening at home and in their lives
reddit,g5ctmy,abgnerd,i get a sense a lot of people feel the way you do the argument being that if the government chooses a full lockdown for the required period it would be painful but is the quickest way to get things back to normal however i feel things are not so simple a full lockdown should be the last resort because of the scale and resources it would require how will we get food to everyone to make sure they have enough to last for that period who will enforce it would not the enforcers be putting themselves in danger if u were sick and need medical treatment how will that work all this needs to be planned for properly and the citizens need to be informed and follow the rules what the government is doing is to base the next step on data yes numbers are high but they are mostly accounted for by the dorms yes on hindsight they can do better but they are dealing with the problem now and that s better than never those numbers will fall the more important numbers are that relating to local transmission cases it s been about a week from the start of circuit breaker measures and numbers are starting to decline but pm lee mentioned they are looking at single digit or even 0 cases clearly it s not enough and hence they need to tighten the measures this i understand what i don t understand is our obsession with the relatively minor things there are people out there breaking cb rules but instead on focusing on our safety by wearing masks and practicing social distance we take videos and condemn them on social media bubble tea became an easy target as to what constitutes essential are these really why covid is still spreading perhaps but we can t say for sure so we will try close up the gaps and in the meantime find links in the cases that have come up the latter is limited by the resources we have there s no way to aggressively test our community cases or more accurately not yet while we still have to devote a large part of those resources to the dorms tl dr in short it will take time a full lockdown should only be the last resort i cry for my bubble tea but i will do my part please stay safe everyone
reddit,g5ctmy,DuePomegranate,all foreign workers in the construction industry are under shn it s basically full lockdown for them cannot even go out to buy food it s similar for the gazetted dorms
reddit,g5tofw,CloudDevelic,i thought for a while and hesitated about posting this but after thinking through about this again and again i ve decided to give my potentially unpopular 2 cents i do know that it s absolutely necessary for this circuit breaker i do know that covid 19 is a super tough sob to fight i do know that we have no choice because of many other reasons including people repeatedly flaunting the cb rules which partially caused this to extend in the 1st place i m aware of the bbt last minute yolo party queue last night while like many of the singaporeans where i m tempted to immediately scoff and jump in to criticize them i thought for a while and decided to take a moment and think through in regards to their situation thoughts and feelings at that moment why do people seem to forgo all logic and common sense for something as trivial as a dumb cup of sugar tea and boba why is it that we can still manage to stay home as much as we can but upon hearing about the non essential f b ban we lose all of our bearings and do ridiculous actions a lot of our lives have been disrupted out of the blue with some of us handling it while others are breaking down entirely you would see people doing funny stuff like using exercising as an excuse to go out taking buses and intentionally going to far places people using buying food as an excuse to go out etc does it sound stupid yes but is it sad yes our lives have just been forcefully disrupted out of the sudden after all also it s the 1st time that us as a nation we had to observe such protocols in the longest time ever as a modern nation is this a firstworldproblem absolutely yes but is it hard yes as well i m pretty sure that many of us definitely have 1 2 snacks comfort food of our liking choice lying around at home such as loaves of bread cakes chips crisps soft drinks etc or whichever other sort of foods that you like during this period of cb now imagine having none of these for 1 month and having to coop up at home some of us facing personal issues or the aftermath of getting retrenched due to covid 19 would you be able to truly be alright if this has been dealt to you on top of all the other stuff that has been handed to you in my humble opinion food itself holds an important role even if we should be living to eat and not eating to live countless times in history have shown that food can make or break a nation army food has been shown to be a mercy comfort and deliverance for this harsh existence of our lives food has been made as our joy and blessing that we can afford to enjoy even in the toughest moments thus having thought all of these points made me feel sad and wanting to empathise with people instead of wanting to laugh scoff mock scold them it made me feel helpless about this pandemic as our hands are tied yet we cannot do anything about it other than abiding by these extreme measures to combat this pandemic it is all the more in such tough times that we as a nation should work together to support our brothers and sisters to overcome this together yes even the less bright ones this saying is already overused and lame af but together we stand divided we fall still holds true f covid 19
reddit,g5tofw,hue32ui,in public spaces divided we stand united we fall xd
reddit,g5tofw,saperis,i thought it was quite obvious cb in place not suppose to go out unless for essential runs however community cases are low compared to foreign workers cases so it is relatively safe to go out this is what happens when you divide community numbers from foreign numbers and give people a false sense of security since bbt essential for some ppl being relatively safe not surprised to see people queuing for bbt it is the same as cb right the smart people chiong for non essentials which will be closed for the rest of cb while the essentials dont need to chiong since you can still get them during cb
reddit,g5tofw,F1toofast,it depends on the context if it is essential products that u absolutely need in daily life like rice or what not you can understand why people would queue cause rice is critical imagine ntuc say they close down for 6weeks obviously ppl would queue but for bubble tea its a totally different case its not a need its more of a want yes there may be some ppl that are addicted to bubble tea but im sure it is very low in numbers or maybe none at all i know there would be a queue but the length of the queue yest is really absurd most of the people who queued yesterday are still living okay they have time and less struggle in their current lives hence they can afford to go down and dont mind spending large amounts of time to queue for bubble tea and neither are they addicted to bubble tea if not there would be a case study in singapore on ppl addiction to bubble tea before this pandemic even happened this means that actually they can forego this bubble tea urge even if they like it so bad like u said u did they not u need to use their logic when they see a queue forming up they should know that crowding is bad at a time like this and no choice get it after this cb ends no choice those who are legit struggling wouldnt even want to queue up for the bubble tea when they see the long queue unless bubble tea is damn critical for them some of them couldnt even care less there are more pressing issues in their life yea i understand ur pov that we shouldnt judge maybe a few of them rlly have a valid reason to get the bubble tea but not the majority of ppl that went to queue its rlly irresponsible of them i think u are being too kind to them
reddit,g5tofw,DecayingSelf,while i understand and appreciate your sympathy and the message you re trying to convey there s a couple of issues which need addressing firstly the so and so is instrumental to so and so s mental health argument is only going to result in an extremely slippery slope in that everyone will suddenly throw the mental health card as an excuse to ignore the circuit breaker measures which exist for good reason and ultimately this issue is greater than just one individual an example i like to bring up is the issue of emotional support animals in the united states they ve been abused to the point of insanity just so people can bring pets to places which are otherwise strictly pet free yeah everyone needs emotional support but sometimes we need to temporarily find new avenues to cope we are already aware of the very real existence of hidden hot spots so let s imagine that because of a bunch of simpletons ignoring safe distancing and otherwise leaving their house for no good reason other than to selfishly satisfy a craving we now have a new explosion of cases and the the lock down is extended who s to blame i get that this is a difficult time for everyone but it only takes a small percentage of the population to ignore the circuit breaker to make it almost impossible to contain the virus and spending unnecessary time outside queuing for a luxury commodity does not help anyone if the net result is yet another circuit breaker extension people need come to terms with the fact that if we don t make sacrifices now then this journey is going to be a lot longer and harder than most of us can tolerate and that will subsequently start a vicious and never ending cycle of i need to go out virus spreads more lock down extended now i really need to go out etc and to address bubble tea directly i absolutely refuse to believe that anyone can possibly have such a serious addiction to this crap that there doesn t exist any suitable interim substitute if you ve got that bad of a sugar craving most supermarkets are still stocked through the roof with snacks and other sugary delicacies so while yes food is important and i do like a good snack every so often myself i do realize that sacrifices need to be made and having a sole dependency is just ridiculous
reddit,g5tofw,LordViole,no excuses they just endangered everyone else i doubt all these bbt addicts are only addicted to bbt could hv bear with it and drink other stuff
reddit,g5tofw,Ukelele-in-the-rain,i agree with your unpopular opinion i think in all our panic and anxiety about the pandemic we haven t really been empathetic about the mental and emotional toll of the situation a lot of the illogical things people are doing are first world problems but we are used to first world living it s a big shake in the reality of life for many singapore has a lot of mental health and stress issues that are swept under the rug it is not surprising that people are cracking and we are seeing them do ridiculous things everyone copesdifferently just do you part let the enforcement officers do their part government do their part and have empathy for all if you are able to be resilient in these times good for you do be understanding that some people may not have the strength it s wrong and they should be corrected fines charged whatever no need to further ridicule them
reddit,g5tofw,tenbre,nah the bbt specifically is inexcusable and should have been banned much longer ago basically it s just a habit if you halt people s habit they will whine and complain for a bit bbt is worse because of the made to order queues and extra load on unnecessary food delivery sugar addiction go buy some coca cola cans and drink at home faster and safer less exposure time comfort food addiction go ntuc buy some junk food
reddit,g5tofw,aaronthro222,together we stand divided we fall should be together we will stand divided stephen colbert
reddit,g5tofw,_amandaz_,speaking as someone who is now 9 weeks into isolation with anxiety issues i m sorry but i can t sympathize at least not totally i think if there are mental health issues those should be addressed but not through accepting excuses people have to want and constantly work on their mental health in order to get better not through instant gratification a lot of boomers were criticized for hoarding the elderly were criticized for staying out to eat so why haven t the young ones learnt by now that this isn t acceptable when most have been the one pointing their fingers were they expecting anything different this food hoarding bbt queuing and hair cut queues are brought on because people think of the upcoming restrictions and some may argue that it is the uncertainty that drove up the need of it but pm said very clearly in his speech yesterday that this circuit breaker will apply for one month in the first instance a month is not too long to form a habit and not too short to try creating alternatives i don t think it is comparable to a war because staples are still provided without the need to compete for them food isn t being rationed supply remains the same not all bubbleteas will be gone it is only brand names that will cease operation during that month at this time it just depends on their flexibility and openness to other substitutes how often do these people drink bubble tea to begin with the government has been increasingly clear in issuing the mandate because trust had been abused as people kept looking for loopholes to exploit if you tell them you can only stay out to exercise suddenly a lot take up hiking brisk walking etc so people pick up jogging what to do limit no of people with safety distance implemented lor if people need to go for walks on mental health reasons they can don a mask i m pretty sure if they called in to enquire they d be allowed to have someone with them both masked and observing safety distance i m pretty sure that a lot of us aren t jaded to the needs of an individual but no one should exploit that you come with good intentions but i m not sure how much that can hold in a time like this some never learn from their falls
reddit,g5tofw,ybct,i am still somewhat sympathetic if people follow the safe distancing measures while queueing for bubble tea and the queue is not that long so people aren t spending too much time in close proximity because one could argue that makes it not much more dangerous than queueing for any other food however if we just look at the huge crowd from the video going around of the grabfood riders argument at waterway point i think it was extremely clear from the huge crowd clustering together that safe distancing was not being followed and that makes it extremely dangerous when you re risking your life and your families lives when you bring the virus home to them is that worth your bubble tea

reddit,g77h15,ned_stark97,i answered this question on quora and it got a modestly significant number of views about 50 upvotes but it got removed by moderation i don t know why probably because it upset some chinese nationalists pro chinese quorans lin xieyi comes to mind as we all know reddit is a liberal western echo chamber so i suppose my views will find some resonance here i posted it on quora because i think it s important to debunk some of the ill informed and simplistic opinions about singapore s foreign policy toward china there are too many of those kinds of people voicing those opinions there and i think too many of our people are not sufficiently educated on our foreign policy positions this has to change if we are to be immunized against influence operations i am neither

20singpoareans 20agree 20with 20the 20ex diplomat do singaporeans agree with the ex diplomat that china is exercising influence pressure and coercion on singapore at first i didn t or was undecided but now i do if you are a prc patriot or are uncomfortable with speculation and insinuations please stop reading now it s for your own good let s examine the source in question who was this ex diplomat bilahari kausikan was former permanent secretary of our ministry of foreign affairs he has substantial experience in the foreign policy arena i assume he might be privy to classified information which is withheld from our public he is no longer a civil servant he is a pensioner as such his views do not officially reflect those of the singapore government despite this his views hold substantial weight and are frequently published in the straits times which although not under direct govt control toes the official line and operates under some form of para state oversight he has not been outright repudiated by other foreign policy elites as was the case with kishore mahbubani from this we may infer that his views resonate somewhat with the establishment or our foreign policy orthodoxy there are some things which our government cannot publicly officially state out of prudence by which i mean complicating our relationships with certain powers it is possible that the government prefers to use unofficial means such as retired civil servants to clarify or rebut certain narratives now let s examine the substance of his argument that china exercises influence pressure and coercion on singapore is not surprising what should be disturbing is the means or the channels through which it deploys its influence there are legitimate channels for interstate intercourse these include diplomacy state media international aid etc etc it is entirely natural whether it is fair or acceptable is a different debate for great powers to leverage their superior political economic military resources to make smaller states comply with their wishes whether through persuasion or coercion but bilahari kausikan s concern is with the illegitimate channels covert influence operations these are violations of singapore s sovereignty albeit under the cover of plausible deniability influence operations fall under the purview of covert action which is different from espionage and far more insidious espionage seeks simply to steal information covert action is intended to influence events for example domestic politics or foreign policy within a target nation state to one s own benefit now let me be clear all great powers conduct influence operations and espionage china is no exception neither is the us and singapore is not exempted from their attempts our response has been

world united states russia spy claims us nabs spore centre research fellow but this is not a valid excuse people who employ this excuse are essentially saying so what everyone does it to quote the chinese ambassador s response i would say firstly that every country hopes to gain recognition and support for its development philosophy and foreign policies in this sense china is no different this is equivalent to arguing that wife beating is acceptable because many husbands beat their wives the issue here is not that china or the us wants our support the issue is the means by which they seek to procure our support american influence operations seek to impose a liberal democratic ideology on singapore they are mostly ineffective because american notions of liberalism do not find much resonance among our public political consciousness nonetheless these operations should be exterminated neutralized whenever and wherever they are detected but chinese influence operations are more dangerous and insidious because they seek to impose a chinese identity on multiracial singapore this is something much harder for our population to resist particularly because our national identity is so young and malleable the appeals of ethnicity and culture are primordial and enduring x200b speculation on china s 2016 2017 influence campaign in august huang jing was exposed for giving supposedly privileged information to a senior member of the lky school so it could be passed on to the singapore government the information was duly conveyed by that senior member of the lkyspp to very senior public officials who were in a position to direct singapore s foreign policy about 3 months later lkyspp dean kishore mahbubani who previously was a senior mfa diplomat and presumably has contact with very senior public officials who were in a position to direct singapore s foreign policy stepped down from his position if you go on youtube and watch the speeches and interviews he has been giving he has become something of a hype man advertising china s rise i think we can put two and two together i do deeply respect kishore mahbubani i think he is an intellectual worth reading and worth listening to i have no doubt that he earnestly sincerely believes in the views that he propounds i definitely agree with many of his ideas about the rise of asia and china in fact i will be buying his new book has china won but i also think some of his ideas regarding china lack nuance reality is often complex when lin xieyi speculated that huang jing was a us agent this was kausikan s comment this is the sort of stuff we must expect intended to confuse the issue some of it will come from the seemingly neutral or well meaning or the naive or from those whom lenin used to call useful idiots

youtube com watch v zeplom2 ctw if you don t have time i ll summarize tl dr skip to the bolded italics when singapore stood firm on its right to state its position on an issue of undoubted importance to us and to the region south china sea the chinese activated their influence apparatus and went into high gear to pressure the government our government to change position not all influence operations pose the same degree of risk the uniqueness of beijing s influence operations stems from china s triple identities and this prescribes three tracks on which china conducts its foreign policy and influence operations first the prc is a state like any other state operating within a still largely westphalian international order on this first track of state to state relations there s nothing particularly unusual about what beijing does except the unusually assertive assertive behaviour of some chinese diplomats of late in countries as far ranging as malaysia the png and sweden secondly the prc is not just any state it s also a leninist state and the characteristic modus operandi of a leninist state is the united front which mao zedong called the ccp s magic weapon the main characteristic of a leninist state is the total subordination of state and society to the interests of the party irrespective whether the party s interest is internal or external and as such the united front represents a blurring of the distinction between domestic and foreign policies and a significant modification of the principle of non interference that goes far beyond what is generally considered acceptable diplomatic practice thirdly the prc is also a civilizational state the embodiment and exemplar of millennia of the chinese nation s history and culture now rejuvenated and this identity as a civilizational state finds expression in the work of the overseas chinese affairs office in plain language overseas chinese should identify their interests with china s interests and work to advance china s interests and this represents a deliberate blurring of the distinction made between the ethnic chinese and the overseas prc citizens now these 3 identities prescribe 3 tracks on which china conducts relationships and taken holistically they create a sophisticated and flexible instrument of influence that is far more effective than the conventional operations conducted by other countries china s influence operations are effective because the 3 tracks on which it operates makes it difficult to deal with or even grasp even understand in entirety on the first track of state to state relations the usual tactics of persuasion inducement or coercion may be deployed as appropriate whether overtly through diplomacy or covertly through intelligence organizations but the united front may simultaneously operate to for example emphasize coercion or inducement even as the first track stresses persuasion and the third civilizational track may conveniently wrap everything up in appeals to ethnic pride now the tendency of all governments and in particular foreign ministries is to focus on the first track of state to state relations and to want to keep them on an even keel but this can all to easily lead to chinese activities on the other two tracks being overlooked or downplayed the narrative of china s absolute rise and america s inevitable decline and others were propagated by various means wechat with chinese speaking populations social and mainstream media whispering campaigns business clan and cultural associations as well as conventional agents of influence reporting to chinese intelligence organizations who cultivate what lenin called useful idiots it was difficult to pin down the precise origin of such narratives but the messaging was to consistent and too insistent to be coincidental many singaporeans did not realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them whole or played along for other reasons businessmen academics and others with interests in china were given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless singapore was more accommodating and passed the messages to the government appeals to ethnic pride were made to others the aim was to instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a chinese identity for multiracial singapore and get singaporeans to pressure the government to align singapore s interests with china s interest in any case and for whatever reason the 2016 2017 chinese influence operation was effective the pressures on the government were great it was very difficult to explain the somewhat abstract importance of unclos or the nuances of our position on the south china sea or the complications of our relationship with china to the general public to whom the chinese narratives were more easily understood and it cannot be denied that ethnic appeals resonated strongly with a probably not insignificant section of our public it s clear enough for whom huang jing worked i told you he had dual us prc citizenship in case you don t know holding dual citizenship is forbidden in china huang jing today holds a senior academic position in china apparently without sanction for holding american citizenship as the only majority ethnic chinese sovereign state in the region singapore is a special case a majority chinese singapore that nevertheless conducts an independent foreign policy may be something of an anomaly in chinese eyes this is not the ravings of some conspiracy theorist this is our former permanent secretary of foreign affairs speaking x200b strategic narratives what is a strategic narrative a weaponized story in its influence campaigns against singapore the prc advances a number of strategic narratives all of which are at best questionable in their truthfulness sadly some of our singaporean chinese compatriots sometimes buy into these narratives and even confidently echo them now most of our population is only cursorily interested in foreign affairs and may find such superficial narratives plausible this must change if they are to be immunized against these narratives this is a war of narratives china cannot officially pressure us to choose sides but they can paint a certain picture through unofficial channels and try to box us into a corner they can try to tell us see this is what you are doing stop it when they do that we must push back by painting our own narratives and showing them that no actually we re not doing that we re doing this myth 1 surely as a chinese country singapore should explain china s position on the south china sea and other issues to the rest of southeast asia myth 2 china is rising and us is declining therefore we should bandwagon with china you should get on the right side of history myth 3 if you are not with china then you are against china you are an american puppet proxy or if you are ethnic chinese even worse a race traitor myth 4 singapore has no claims in the south china sea and purports to be a neutral non aligned country so why is it taking sides with the us against china by agreeing with the pca ruling and hosting us naval assets myth 5 unlike lee kuan yew the current pap leadership under lee hsien loong doesn t know how to deal with china relations were sooooo much better under lky let me proceed to puncture each of these myths in turn with great pleasure myth 1 we are not a chinese country we are a country that happens to have a majority ethnic chinese population that organizes itself on the basis of multiracialism multiculturalism this has been fundamental to singapore s identity since the days of lee kuan yew and this is something we must always remember no matter how many times we are accused of being race traitors by our mainland friends when the prc tries to impose a chinese identity on multiracial singapore we must resist yes we share ties with mainland chinese on the basis of blood and culture this ethnocultural kinship should be celebrated not denied as in the case of some hkers our similar cultural programming allows us to understand the chinese mindset in some respects to empathize with it but it does not mean we should unreservedly parrot china s claims to the rest of southeast asia as country coordinator for asean china relations our job is to uphold asean centrality to represent the interests of asean of our region in dealing with china it is not to represent china s interests in dealings with asean we have no obligation moral or otherwise to advocate or support china s interests understanding them is one matter supporting them is another the two are not mutually irreconcilable but they must be distinguished myth 2 this myth like many other myths has a grain of truth to it it is very ably represented by the speeches and works of professor kishore mahbubani our former ambassador and an intellectual whom i admire very much unfortunately it is also extremely oversimplified and ignores many problematic nuances indeed china is rising and has been for quite a while you would have to be blind to deny that but china s rise is not going to be linear it is going to be a long winding and fluctuating road china has many internal structural problems of its own to deal with from the way some people talk about china in juxtaposition to the west it makes it sound like the chinese are strategic masterminds while the westerners are a bunch of bumbling idiots like i said grain of truth but grossly oversimplistic it ignores many of the us intrinsic strengths and some of china s structural challenges china is rising but america is not in decline except in relative terms militarily it is still pre eminent in the asia pacific its military dominance is receding and will continue to recede in time as the pla navy becomes stronger china is becoming more and more economically central to our region and the world depending on which index of measurement you use gdp ppp gdp per capita absolute gdp it may have already eclipsed the us economy china is pushing the frontiers of cutting edge technology like 5g this process is inevitable but what is not inevitable is the outcome of china displacing the us as regional or global superpower this is an outcome that is far from certain it is still too early to tell the only thing we can say for now is that the regional strategic equation will become more and more symmetrical over time as with buying new stocks shares on the financial market it is too early to count our chickens before they are hatched some views on china s rise mahbubani s included tend to take the whig view of history up and up and on and on x200b https preview redd it y73carvadru41 png width 602 format png auto webp s

chinese never tire of reminding us that china s presence in asia is a permanent geographic fact while america s presence is the product of a political calculation this implies both enhanced threat and opportunity for the rest of east asia be nice to us because you have to live with us for the rest of eternity and that is true what is our plan b if america withdraws from the region without america the balance of power in asia cannot be maintained but again this myth is too simplistic america s presence in asia is not as fragile as the chinese would like us to think asia is burgeoning with growth in the next few decades the economic center of gravity is going to shift toward the asia pacific america has an interest in retaining access to this region in economic and military terms i do agree that china cannot be contained it is so interdependent with america that america might as well try to contain itself as to contain china but we should not underestimate the degree to which america has integrated and committed itself to the asia pacific myth 3 this one i find the most ludicrous and at the same time the most hilarious just because i disagree with china s stance on a specific single issue means that i must have been brainwashed by western media into being an anti china dog hahahaha this is what is known as a false dichotomy it is powerful because these dichotomies do exist but they are a spectrum rather than a binary choice of a or b china posits an illusory binary between itself and the west and forces you to choose between them if you are not a then you must be b and only b and nothing else substitute a and b with pro china and pro us pro ccp and pro democracy blah blah blah you get the idea this ignores all the nuances in between this myth is also the most insidious and dangerous one because it denies the existence of agency on the part of small states it denies that small states can ever act autonomously that anything that we do must be driven by the hidden hand of great power competition singapore s policy can be characterized as strategic hedging i will admit we lean slightly toward low intensity soft balancing against china but it is still more nuanced than hard balancing against china and hard bandwagoning with the us by the way singapore is not the only country practicing a hedging strategy duterte has recently taken to flirting with china i don t blame him i think it s a smart move but he has also increased cooperation with japan and he has not abolished the alliance treaty which formally commits the us to defend the philippines in wartime thailand has grown closer toward china as well buying chinese tanks but it is still a us ally even myanmar when myanmar realized in the 2000s and early 2010s that it was growing more and more dependent on chinese investment infrastructure etc what did it do it initiated a rapprochement with the obama administration malaysia under mahathir began to reassess a number of chinese infrastructure projects in light of its indebtedness to china the american 7th fleet still calls at malaysian ports vietnam is probably leaning even further toward the balancing end of the spectrum

singaporeans do not believe that we are alone in playing this delicate game of power balancing that is what china wants you to believe that we are acting alone and inadvertently as a us proxy when in reality we are making calculated choices to minimize risk and maximize gain myth 4 yes singapore is a non claimant state we have no territorial claims in the south china sea and we take no position on the claims of vietnam philippines malaysia china etc but what we do have is an interest in freedom of navigation in the south china sea enshrined in international law namely unclos we want our merchant ships carrying our imports and exports to be able to transition the south china sea freely trade is the lifeblood of our free and open economy now some mainland chinese might argue that china has not explicitly threatened the right of freedom of navigation in the area they are right china has not demanded we pay a toll or tariff for passing through the area not yet anyway hopefully it never does but china s behavior of creating and militarizing artificial islands in the south china sea has not exactly inspired confidence on the part of southeast asian states regarding its future behavior and in case you think our statement on the pca s verdict was somehow extreme or new let me read out the statement to you singapore has taken note of the award made by the arbitral tribunal convened under annex vii to the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos on 12 july 2016 on the case between the republic of the philippines and the people s republic of china we are studying the award and its implications on singapore and the wider region singapore is not a claimant state and we do not take sides on the competing territorial claims however we support the peaceful resolution of disputes among claimants in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law including unclos without resorting to the threat or use of force as a small state we strongly support the maintenance of a rules based order that upholds and protects the rights and privileges of all states singapore values our long standing and friendly relations with all parties bilaterally and in the context of asean we urge all parties to fully respect legal and diplomatic processes exercise self restraint and avoid conducting any activities that may raise tensions in the region singapore supports the full and effective implementation of the declaration on the conduct of parties in the south china sea and the expeditious conclusion of a legally binding code of conduct in the south china sea in other words we did not even explicitly support the ruling of the pca in favor of the philippines we simply positively acknowledged the ruling and said that international law is important and we should all respect it can that be any less provocative how could this be construed in any way as taking sides are the chinese really so thin skinned that they object to us even speaking about the scs issue let me remind you that the pca was the same court that ruled in favor of our dispute with malaysia over pedra branca so what would the implication be if we supported the pca ruling for ourselves but turned a blind eye to its ruling over the scs international law for me but not for thee note also that singapore was not alone vietnam myanmar and malaysia also positively acknowledged or outright supported the ruling of the pca why did we deserve to be singled out for coercion non alignment neutrality is a preference it is not a solution singapore cannot prosper and be secure simply by pursuing a hiding strategy of laying low and hoping not to be noticed i will be happy to elaborate if you disagree we host the us military because we consider it productive to our security interests and that of regional security for america to maintain a regional presence this is to provide a counterweight to china and give us strategic space to maneuver it is not to contain china or obstruct its rise x200b https preview redd it dl1v9eiudru41 png width 602 format png auto webp s 674abcbdbdd903a8cc61d6b00f3ef61f0f2d92b0 and while we are on the subject we should note that the us military only maintains a purely rotational presence in singapore there are no permanent us military bases or assets stationed here the naval base which their aircraft carrier uses belongs to us we should also further note that singapore has no formal treaty of alliance with america in fact it is rumored that in 2003 america offered us the status of a major non nato ally a formal security commitment from the us to defend singapore and we rejected them now is that how we would behave if we were really american proxies i am non aligned in the sense that i do not want to be involved in power blocs but when my security singapore s survival singapore s prosperity is threatened i cannot be neutral lee kuan yew singapore has to take the world as it is it is too small to change it but we can try to maximise the space we have to maneuver among the big trees in the region lee kuan yew one man s view of the world 2013 myth 5 kishore claimed that now that lky is no longer with us we should change our behaviour significantly we should be very restrained in commenting on matters involving great powers i agree with him that we should be circumspect pragmatic even cold blooded when it comes to dealing with great powers we must tread carefully but has there been any fundamental change in singapore s policy toward china post lky no our relationship with the us goes back to the 1990s likewise with china we have always and i emphasize we continue to promote the engagement of china with the region and the world china must come to terms with the world order just as the world order must accommodate china the chinese like to grumble about the good old days of lky and how well he got along with them again they are not wrong but this is a form of historical cherry picking of selective memory remember that lky was one of the only asian leaders to go up against a ccp backed communist united front and win remember also that mao s china issued frequent propaganda proclamations labelling him a running dog of the west lee kuan yew s views on china were not one dimensional they were complex and nuanced they were tactful yes but honest and direct he did not shy away from political incorrectness https www youtube com watch v cb4nwq24mpk https www youtube com watch v cb4nwq24mpk the chinese may make a miscalculation they may become assertive and pushy which is contrary to their long term interest which is to win over the smaller countries in the south to their side lee kuan yew 2011 my uncle in law had this romantic idea that you know china is a land of my forefathers i have no doubts that the land of my forefathers would have brought me down in the world they the chinese wanted me to contribute to my uncle in law s manor house which the chinese refurbished and made into a historic tourist site i said no no i m not chinese i m singaporean i m not going to visit the place i have no romantic view about where i sprang from i m very grateful that my great grandmother who was born here decided she s not going to go back to china with her husband because she doesn t know china i m a lucky fellow yes we are all lucky fellows but the older generation has this romantic idea i discovered when i was a student in england that i had more in common with the singaporeans and malaysians of other races than with the chinese from china because they are completely different their dress their manners their language they are a different lot that s all they come from a different society of course at the end of the day they are chinese lee kuan yew hard truths 2011 that romantic idea of going back to the bosom of your motherland is a delusion we have become different that s all you can go back to china you re still different if you go to china i don t think you will belong they ll say okay we ll accept you but look at even the malayan communist cadres who sent their families and children there nevertheless they were treated differently you think you re chinese and that you will blend in but you will not you are already different we are already different just like the american and the british people or for that matter the south african whites australians new zealanders and the british the taiwanese mainlanders and chinese mainlanders who have not stayed in taiwan yes they are same stock same heritage but had different exposure different standpoints different views of the world are we chinese yes ethnically can we sit down with the chinese and really feel part of them not possible because you speak chinese no your major premises are in your mind lee kuan yew hard truths 2011 the chinese expect us to be more respectful you must respect me they tell us countries big or small are equal we re not a hegemon but when we do something they don t like they say you have made 1 3 billion people unhappy so please know your place lee kuan yew hard truths 2011 i do not see singapore surviving on the chinese economy if we spoke only chinese we would not be today s singapore what is the difference if china is ten times stronger it will make us ten times stronger no our prosperity comes from linkages with the world the future is the same we are not hainan island we are not hong kong where they have no choice we are in the centre of an archipelago of great diversity with rich natural resources and the world will come here lee kuan yew one man s view of the world 2013 how can the chinese object to the american logistics hub here that is crude if they ask us to stop the logistics base our answer would be you can use the logistics base and store your equipment here so we would host both the chinese and americans lee kuan yew one man s view of the world 2013 singapore is quite comfortable with the americans being present we do not know how brash or assertive china will become when i said in 2009 that we must balance china they translated the word in chinese into conscribe and there was a big uproar among their netizens who asked how dare i say that when i am chinese they are hypersensistive lee kuan yew one man s view of the world 2013 you have to accept the fact that they china are the biggest boy in the neighbourhood they will not be the biggest in the pacific because the us will always be there to counterbalance them but increasingly they would be able to keep the us away from the coastal regions that s a development we have to accept no more uncomfortable for singapore than for the other countries it s even more tricky for vietnam we have no conflict of interest with china we have no such overlapping claims with them lee kuan yew one man s view of the world 2013 conclusion let me emphasize again i see the rise of china as a good thing in the long term it is not an absolute good but it is good china is a friend even if friends can be pushy at times and we do not always agree with our friends about everything all the time singapore and china have no fundamental clash of core interests indeed i think it is possible for our core interests to align with china not only with china but also with the us india japan etc whether or not it aligns with china to a greater degree than with other powers is to be seen and in large part decided by china s own behaviour but in any case if there is alignment our lodestar must always be our national interest singapore s own national interest determined by singaporeans own choices alone and no one else s undiluted by the manipulation of any foreign entity and in case you think i m only referring to china go look at our handling of the 1988 hendrickson affair huang jing was only one manifestation of this foreign powers will continue to attempt to influence our policy when they stick their fingers into our sovereign discursive

reddit,g77h15,zhrmghg,i think the target audience of these alleged influence operations might be more receptive to a chinese rather than english essay regarding myth 4 i think china s displeasure lies much more with our support of the current system of international laws in general rather than taking any sides in the ruling smaller powers like singapore benefits much more from such laws than bigger powers usa china russia and perhaps the uk and france have all treated these laws as applicable only when it benefits themselves just looks at how many international conventions the us hasn t signed up to or the south china sea issue or uk outright rejecting and ignoring the ruling on displaced chagossians from biot big powers do not like it when international law forbids them from doing something beneficial to them which they can otherwise do with their might and power and since these laws are seldom enforceable they just go ahead and break or reject them when it suits them it is no surprise that china takes offence at our and asean s support of a rule based international order that ill suits their interests

reddit,g77h15,PeakPhantom1,great post op i d like to add a timely reminder that china s interests do not necessarily align with singapore s in particular the proposed development of the kra canal and gwadar port under the obor initiative would pose a direct threat to maritime traffic through the straits of malacca
reddit,g77h15,Zelta-nine,not a bad answer in fact this one is actually quite good quite a balanced and non biased answer something rare on reddit especially on topics like this
reddit,g77h15,FriendlyPyre,i discovered when i was a student in england that i had more in common with the singaporeans and malaysians of other races than with the chinese from china because they are completely different their dress their manners their language they are a different lot that s all they come from a different society of course at the end of the day they are chinese very true even now especially now further i would not call china a friend of singapore it is merely a partner like america like every country that isn t singapore perhaps the closest singapore has to a friend is israel but even then it s a partnership born from circumstance also i would go further and say that china desires neither friends nor partners they are looking for vassals protectorates slaves the government does not desire equal footing they desire dominance
reddit,g77h15,LaZZyBird,singapore will never come under the sinosphere so long as multiculturalism remains our core identity china s identity is predicated on the idea of a united chinese ethnicity stretching back thousands of year in one unbroken heritage that is what keeps a country of different provinces and states together despite clear differences between those from fujian shanxi guangdong sichuan not mentioning the thousand other minorities erased under a common chinese banner singapore buying into that tale would tear the foundations of what this country is denying the contributions of the other ethnicities who live around us lky entire nation building project was constructed around the multiracial identity of singapore that was the reason why he was so successful he could have easily made singapore a chinese state there are some parties who wanted to do that in the founding of singapore i see china attempt to push a chinese nationalistic identity futile just like how indonesia tried just like how malaysia tried hold on to that multiculturalism and rojak identity i believe that is our best safeguard against any nation attempting to lure us with nationalistic promises
reddit,g77h15,HonestProjection,really interesting read thanks for taking the time to impart some knowledge to us all after all the best defence against false information is an education that leads to critical thinking and it s true that with covid we ve seen the harder edges to the narratives that all countries like to push my history teacher would be glad that am still reading things like this even though we re done with the exam
reddit,g77h15,slack-ar,on the news seems like tv drama still stick to
reddit,g77h15,desmuru,i m not very well versed in politics but i can say that tensions are high between the west and china especially because of the coronavirus outbreak as a small country we don t have the privilege of picking sides seeing that we can t afford to offend both parties i do have to say that playing the middle ground would definitely be the most sensible thing for us to do
reddit,g77h15,NC16inthehouse,long thoughtful content like this one of the reasons i like quora more than reddit

reddit,g77h15,lupCheong,the place is run by sinkies and it didn t bother me too much so i still continue to patronise them much better now since the ultra ccp auntie is gone though after wuhan i m definitely going to call these people out its time they learnt not to blatantly throw their bullshit in our faces
reddit,g77h15,HidingCat,lawl you just got reported as a wumao looks like there are a couple of people who want to silence you here too
reddit,g77h15,CodrutaStefanceau,wow i wasn t expecting this here very well put analysis fully agreed that there s huge battle of narratives here and the methods of oversimplification can almost be insidious the false dichotomy is terribly annoying for the record i hate both the ccp and the us foreign policies what do you think of the narratives in local media here especially that of our mandarin media my sensing of it is that it is extremely pro ccp china and i ve a few theories and infiltration is one of them as well
reddit,g77h15,merigo123,haha unfortunately my dad listens more to mainland news coz he finds that taiwanese news anchors are a bit too loud mouthed matter of taste i guess
reddit,g77h15,keizee,i m kinda sure myth 1 had been stated by lhl once forgot where but he definitely touched on it said he has to remind china that they don t do that myth 2 tbh anybody who has followed more than 2 americans who tweet about politics and policies would already have a pretty bad impression of america s government with those kind of divisive sentiments i m surprised that they haven t imploded yet i d say the narrative about china rising and america declining came from america itself after all make america great again literally implies that they are declining
reddit,g77h15,raidorz,time to join the milk tea alliance

reddit,g77h15,pendelhaven,you have to reconsider your view on malaysia and indonesia they view us as a thorn in the flesh and a robber that robbed malay land to form a chinese enclave in this part of the world they would be the first to gobble us up when a chance presents itself you will also be surprised by the number of local malays that hold this view
reddit,g77h15,amapau,great post and i completely agree with you the best way to combat the chinese influence is to embrace the duality of being chinese and singaporean embracing our identity and exercising critical thinking is the best remedy for this i cannot stress the importance of multiculturalism to being a singaporean going on a tangent here but soft power is definitely not only limited to china it would be hypocritical of us to preach self determination rejecting the negative chinese influence while blindly chasing our favourite idol groups watching our favourite kdramas shopping at korean marts using the skin products etc etc the same goes for the japanese and probably any other significant cultural product perhaps what is fundamentally different is the facade of an insidious motive behind china s diplomacy who s to say the other countries do not have a vested interest in influencing our perceptions of them therefore it is paramount to just simply be aware however anti chinese sentiment is not warranted just because we are keeping them at arm s length we should not reject our chinese friends even if they harbour pro chinese views the onus is on us to filter and understand that they are less than pawns in this game of chess played by the big powers or they wouldn t even be here thanks for the great read op

reddit,g77h15,CxCee,question re myth 5 do you know of any official statements from china i m aware that it s a line that s been parroted by global times but i m wondering if there s anything more concrete behind it i agree with your speculation re kishore it seems like the consensus in the academic community as well bilahari s made it obvious enough without saying it explicitly too do you plan on studying geopolitics or a career in it
reddit,g77h15,slurymcflurry2,i enjoyed reading your post i worry that my father has been influenced by the pro china propoganda i find it curious because it became more apparent when he got a taiwanese gf anyway there s one time he said china is preparing a city for ethnic chinese people of the world to seek sanctuary in he said the prc gov acknowledge that ethnic chinese are everywhere and were never betrayer of the chinese voyages of old and thus it would only be right for prc to allow the chinese to come back home i laughed i said why would i ever want to live in china i enjoy so much flexibility with my life in malaysia at the time and now in singapore i get to be a white trash bish when i feel like it even while eating a great bowl of tauhuey he was deeply offended may i ask what your take is on that city of returning chinese
reddit,g77h15,Fireflytruck,singapore is not china singapore has and will continue to make decisions that best suit singapore s own geopolitical and economic interests it is completely reasonable for singapore appearing to be siding with either the usa or china at certain political and or economic junctures as long as the positions provide the best affordance towards singapore s interests at the moment or even in the long run singaporeans should not be pro america nor pro china rather singaporean should simply be pro singapore
reddit,g77h15,faeded_,thank you for this my dad is super pro china and it honestly really disturbs me he consumes chinese media all day and propaganda news shows on youtube he says as chinese we should learn chinese history and we shouldn t forget our roots he even suggests that history lessons in school should teach how westerners used to mistreat the chinese back in the day truly brainwashed statements i have to constantly remind him that we re multicultural singaporean first and chinese second please help me save my dad from the ccp

reddit,g77h15,Cavani85,not a native mandarin speaker here interesting anecdotes wrt their mindset not generalizing but firsthand experience i have a prc friend who got slightly offended when i said wo yao jiang hua yi yi dian dian and insisted me to correct it as wo yao jiang zhong wen yi dian dian i dunno whats the difference in this context i still use hua yi to annoy her what i find annoying was when she came to visit sg and i brought her to the teochew porridge hokkien mee usual sg hawker food suspects she insisted that it was all fake chinese food and kept comparing to her prc homeland deep inside i felt sorry for her you re supposed to be on holiday just chill and enjoy when asked about her favorite bbt chain she proclaimed her love for heytea as a proudly prc brand cool however a few days ago i had a general conversation about boba with a taiwanese friend and casually mentioned heytea you know the brand in shenzhen she swiftly corrected me and insisted that it s origin is taiwanese now i m confused
reddit,g77h15,InterimNihilist,see this is exactly what i mean the chinese shills have flooded every nook and cranny of the internet
reddit,g77h15,hnryirawan,tl dr do not be distracted by the chinese operations always keep a calm mind and remember you re not obligated to help the chinese i really agree with the general view of this essay however i just want to say this regarding current situation trump is really making it difficult for us to lean more toward us us is not weak and its institutions definitely resilient enough to survive a trump or two however i definitely think that trump is making himself a huge hurdle and hassle to work with and constantly undercutting its own agencies and people his own unpredictability and whims are also not helpful when he s attacking its own allies and arbitrarily pulled off international agreements that us himself is pushing he also makes it looks like us is less commited to asia than before i m pretty sure his aides and people who actually knows what to do is helping to steer him however what can be seen is that he constantly replacing that kind of aides with his own preferred people because he does not seem to be comfortable with those kind of nuances and diplomacy because of all the problem with trump its making it easier for china to push us toward her china can advocate themselves as more stable more predictable partners that will not arbitrarily tore up agreements or embarass her allies in international stage compared to us china can advocate themselves as they will not have a trump moment i probably don t live long enough to remember older presidents or study alot more about us history but i think at least the worst us president are still thinking on how to push us forward and not just thinking on how to win next election
reddit,g77h15,VerySlickRhymes,but there s nothing wrong with being a china supporter right just checking
reddit,g77h15,fressplush,omg same i quarrel with my dad on this issue every single time its honestly frustrating and helpless because he is stubborn af
reddit,g77h15,Rambunctiousrabbits,thank you for the excellent post when you mentioned china s covert operations to exercise influence and push forth their political narrative in singapore i immediately thought about social media predominantly facebook during the days when local news were rife with reports about protest ridden hk instead of covid 19 back then i couldn t help but notice when an article by st or cna about the protests was posted there would be a barrage of pro china comments or assertations that may or may not be substantiated by any basis of fact these comments were often made by accounts that were seemingly singaporean local township etc but looked to be a facade or fake accounts created by prc chinese based their empty profile lack of local contextual knowledge profile backgrounds etc or pro chinese boomers in any case i could never confirm my suspicions and i never found any discussions on this matter if indeed true i thought it was a fine but insidious example of china propagting their narrative and their version of history only that it is the effort of their citizens rather than a political move by the ccp
reddit,g77h15,Koufas,tbh you should post this on facebook and make it public and let the shares roll in reddit like you said will already be critical enough us knowing this is good but we re not the ones you need to convert
reddit,g77h15,joelfirenze,china s rise is neither good or bad for singapore it is a fact that we will have to live with and use it for singapore s good prosperity and welfare and at the same time while maintaining our social cohesion if china s rise and prosperity leads to social division in singapore then we will have to find some way to deal with it if china s rise leads to intense division and polarisation then we will have to figure out for ourselves if it is something we want and what trade offs are we willing to make even if at the cost of prosperity
reddit,g77h15,mikkkee,before reaching to the conclusion that the rise of china is a good thing you need to read this how china sees the world https www theatlantic com magazine archive 2020 05 mcmaster china strategy 609088 by mcmaster https en wikipedia org wiki h _r _mcmaster former national security advisor and a retired lt gen of the united states the ccp s goal is never to be a friendly participant that plays by international rules they want to put in place a modern day version of the tributary system and singapore as well as all the other sea countries is at most one of the many vassal states under that system let me quote one paragraph from the above article our last meeting of the state visit in the great hall of the people was with li keqiang the premier of the state council and the titular head of china s government if anyone in the american group had any doubts about china s view of its relationship with the united states li s monologue would have removed them he began with the observation that china having already developed its industrial and technological base no longer needed the united states he dismissed u s concerns over unfair trade and economic practices indicating that the u s role in the future global economy would merely be to provide china with raw materials agricultural products and energy to fuel its production of the world s cutting edge industrial and consumer products you cannot expect china to see you as a friend when what they really want is a vassal state
reddit,g77h15,123dream321,temasek holding is investing in china as much as it has invested in singapore it is our economic interest that our investment does well
reddit,g77h15,BreakWindow,in any case and for whatever reason the 2016 2017 chinese influence operation was effective the pressures on the government were great it wasn t merely the terrexes the whole chinese identity in singapore was put into question and division of course we will never send our terrexes or sensitive military equipment via hong kong again it is whether are singaporeans are informed enough to defend our cause we want a world that follows international laws
reddit,g77h15,regulusryan,hahaha yeah trump is just a symptom of the issues that they are currently facing now i wanted bernie to be the nominee but i really hope biden can win in november to restore american prestige in the world and clean up whatever bullshit that trump has created
reddit,g77h15,wackocoal,that is a well thought and written essay anything longer than 3 paragraphs is an essay to me lol i m a simple person i do not understand politics or whatever you guys call it very well i like simple rules or heuristics for me it doesn t matter what ethnicity you are once you are a citizen of a nation i expect you to swear your alliegence and loyality singapore first chinese insert whatever ethnicity you prefer second
reddit,g77h15,DDELFIERRO,if singapore fails to constantly consistently press the issue that it is a sovereign city state beholden to neither china s or the united states overt influence able to pick choose by its own accord the path which most benefits singapore itself in the long run china s going to treat singapore as if it were taiwan like a wayward child just out of reach swinging its belt in an obvious threat but not quite fully connecting yet eventually it will ignore all previous agreements as if singapore were senile and somehow forgot that it was always china and never independent it will actively move to insert its own handpicked democratic leaders into place who will conveniently bend over and slap down singapore into being what hong kong is right now sycophantic leadership will hand over the keys right to china like the vichy french handed over france in 1940 to nazi germany
reddit,g77h15,beanstalkandthejack,is there a chinese translated version of your post often it is chinese readers like older generation chinese singaporeans or a chinese native speaker that would benefit from such a point of view
reddit,g77h15,Maximum_spirit,love the post op easily can get a for general paper i do believe that the chinese influence operations in singapore are truly effective if our identity as singaporean is easily destroyed and that local here felt like a foreigner in short discrimination within the local population could easily play into china s favour the sydney gang rape sparked a lot of hate crime between the muslims australian and white australian and undesirable groups could use this opportunity to influence individuals who are seeking their own community when being treated as an outcast i do fear that the xenophobia in singapore could be a weapon that china could easily use and divide us singaporean
reddit,g77h15,SadKaleidoscope2,that s why crossposts matter we can tackle the system by looking at different echo chambers responses
reddit,g77h15,GnocchiPooh,i think you ll see that it s a futile in exercise mostly because singaporeans don t listen to logic but results which has its pros and cons i ve up voted bill s stuff before but he is a hardcore supporter of china and has entrenched views of people who don t like them my parents are similar and convincing requires results for them in geopolitics thats a really long term thing and most probably they won t wanna see generally i think singaporeans are really shallow which is a result of policies i think and the good part is that we can assimilate extremely quickly and i think that s our sekret weapon against psyops
reddit,g77h15,hachipotato,hello op i m really glad you decided to write about this not many singaporeans have an idea about foreign interference or political warfare it doesn t help that we don t really have much discourse or modules on it at the undergraduate level to study this issue in depth i actually didn t really learn about this sort of thing until i went for exchange in the us you re pretty spot on in your analyses it s not just narratives they re weaponising but identity as well capitalising on our chinese ethnicity in order to stir up support for the motherland is something they ve started to do especially in the early 2010s if i remember correctly i had to write a paper about political interference when i was in ut austin and in it i did a comparison between singapore and australia i d be welcome to share it if you guys are down although it s a little rough since i was on exchange and only completed the paper in like the last 4 days still got that a cos america

reddit,g77h15,SyncOut,the american people are trump can be voted out of the oval office if he isn t he will serve only until his term limit in 2024 in china meanwhile xi jinping will stay as president until the day he dies until then all of china s decisions are up to him alone from here you can tell which country has more accountability
reddit,g77h15,doc-tom,kausikan implies that the chinese government knows about huang jing s us citizenship this should have automatically nullified his prc passport because the prc nationality law explicitly forbids the holding of a foreign citizenship
reddit,g77h15,pieinabox,thanks for your post op the title and the initial part on covert influence ops i ll use subversion as its more accurate for what you re describing made me look forward to a cohesive illustration on chinese subversion in singapore but aside from one single speculation on huang jing s allegiance the rest of your post are on strategic narratives and you break it down to 1 perceived myths 2 myths busting with granted valid arguments you re right to point out that these myths are superficial and should be busted to protect our interests lest unsuspecting chinese singaporeans buy into it however existence of chinese myths are not indicative of an active influence operation or subversive activity in the spirit of your title and your huang jing case study i would love to see how these myths are actively propagated to subvert our polity the five myths appear to me to be a bad faith and simplistic reading of chinese foreign policy towards singapore but i ll be happy to be proven wrong if you could provide evidence to how it was illustrated or propagated and not just a mere hunch of what you think china wants us to behave unless you re suggesting that these myths are propagated by agents like huang jing to our elites then i ll say they re so unsophisticated in your words superficial that anyone who spent time any time in our administration would know how to rebut it just like what you ve done here
reddit,g77h15,nanireddit,american influence operations seek to impose a liberal democratic ideology on singapore nah they care about the choking point of malacca making singapore more liberal like hk suits the us s geopolitical interest it would be easier to manipulate singaporeans into thinking democracy is better than good governance and competent politicians just look at saudi arabia the us doesn t give a shit about a liberal democratic ideology do americans do not what americans say chinese identity grows naturally you cannot impose it at the same time you cannot deny or contain it imho as long as china keeps growing economically militarily culturally pop culture media influence etc it will happen naturally like it or not
reddit,g77h15,Zhaojaotheboss,great read very refreshing and elaborate haha given the current circumstances looking at how america is handling everything especially if you consider an economic perspective i can t deny the fear of the scales tilting towards china anyway would love to read more about your perspectives on matters like this in the future

reddit,g77h15,aikawanoonase,i think this post needs to be permanently linked on the sub s sidebar somehow really excellently articulated
reddit,g77h15,reddct,that was very well put together thanks op with how large china looms some degree of sinicization is inevitable i feel a lot of our fortunes hinges on how the singaporean identity evolves we are an immigrant country by necessity and the makeup of our populace will mirror that the rojak remains but the sauce changes the duality of a singaporean chinese cosmolander and all the tensions which come with it
reddit,g77h15,khaophat,very well written piece thanks for taking so much time to write this i agree with what you said that preaching all these to singaporeans on reddit doesn t really bring much marginal benefit given that the singaporean community here is definitely more woke and liberal vs our average typical singaporean out there in fact it is very possible that apathy combined with lack of political awareness and critical thinking would be our society s biggest threat much more so than whatever china is allegedly up to from my own experience growing up going through the system primary secondary then jc followed by ns and graduating from a local uni it is still very much a spoonfed paternalistic grades results oriented mindset that our leaders and those in authority moulds us to adopt even if that is not the intended outcome and that is what truly scares me as a singaporean today that my fellow countryman is not able to think independently for themselves to be able to decide for themselves what s right and what s wrong what s truth and what s opinion and to understand the larger geopolitical picture this is very well exemplified when i hear my own parents relatives spouting illogical nonsense that are reactionary whenever they listen to some sound bites from the news one classic example was the hong kong riots where a lot of the older generation had a very negative reaction towards the rioters even to the extent of suggesting that hk ers are dumb and should just listen to china and not destroy their own lives etc etc these boomers don t take the time to explore alternate narratives from other media sources both chinese and western and purely relied on watching amateur facebook videos shared via boomer whatsapp groups to come to their own short sighted conclusions the lack of critical and independent thinking displayed is worrying and i do hope that it is not representative of the average singaporean we definitely need more people like you op to have the patience to encourage critical thought and address ignorance

reddit,g77h15,stephenfa,immigration is a double edged sword in the long run it destroys social fabric and cohesion if the ruling whites don t share power with the less dominant minorities us currently spends around 35 of gdp on healthcare that s almost 6 trillion usd and it still has the most deaths of any nation from covid china spends less than 1 trillion usd and has contained the outbreak much better that statistic alone shows how bloated and inefficient the system is in the us both the military and the healthcare systems are solely built for the profit of the corporations not for any real efficiency the scs islands china is building will force the us navy to spend 100 for every 1 china spends on missile and anti ship defense to fight over a bunch of rocks which have no real intrinsic value to china once the us losses start to accumulate in the scs the political pressure will be enough to force a us retreat china doesn t need to engage in a protracted war to force the us navy out of the scs

reddit,g77h15,khaizersozay,i have personally been to china 4 times as a traveller and have also lived and worked with prcs in close proximity for more than a year the demographics of people i ve met and interacted with range from hippies fresh grads working class middle class fu er dais 2nd generation rich 1st to 3rd tier city people as well as ethnic minorities including tibetans and uyghurs first of all i really do find china politically today very similar to singapore almost like a mirror image in many ways no surprise since dxp and lky were good friends and strong admirers of each other secondly most of the nationalism i felt is quite healthy like how you disagree with and hate your parents sometimes but ultimately still love them there are also those who know that the ccp positions itself in a way that they want people to accept that there s no distinction between the party and the state they have a lot to lose if they go against that doctrine and overwhelming majority has agreed that economic reform political reform imho singapore is a country with very weak identity i agree we are more vulnerable due to majority of ethnic chinese as well as language proficiency if you are more jiak kantang you will consume more anglo saxon media and train of thoughts will be more aligned to the west vice versa but due to our bilingualism and hopefully with a healthy level of critical thinking and skepticism we are able to find a middle ground which is pro singapore however we are also forgetting that being pro singapore is not just for the chinese we have our minorities who do not have the luxury of reading chinese and understanding china s cultural and political nuances as much as we do they are pro singapore with hints of singaporean xenophobic characteristics because of that they are less inclined to seek to understand china and thus more likely to spout out ill informed narratives too this i have witnessed numerous times and trying to correct them may sometimes come across as being pro china but than again they are not the target audience of chinese influence nevertheless that should change in order to seek a more balanced view if there are people who wish to be pro china i would say let them be because these are people who feel that national interest personal interest and that is a freedom of choice i am not too concerned about convincing them otherwise likewise for people who wish to be pro west there are merits as well as flaws in both non of which are universal too so long as the govt doesn t keep making singaporeans feel like 2nd class citizens in our own country we should be more than ok i think since donald trump the world may have ushered in a new era of inward looking politics i m of the opinion that political cycles come and go just like economic cycles both of which are closely linked considering that we are a nation of immigrants and very young one too older singaporeans may feel that there s more affinity to this land than younger singaporeans personally any country with strong nationalism is potentially capable of having it descend to fascism we see today a rise in ultra right wing populist movements in the western hemisphere due to globalisation and immigration policies gone wrong assaults and hate crimes linked to racism and xenophobia are on the rise asians who were born and deeply assimilated in western societies are now given the message that their presence is conditional that s why i resist any patriotic urges i may have sometimes because if allowed to manifest too much it becomes unhealthy but having the singapore passport is damn shiok and i thank all the forces of universe for making that possible fear of outsiders is on the rise despite the world being more globalised than it has ever been china is no exception and they have the history to remind them of it century of humiliation boxer rebellion drum which the ccp has beaten with gusto for their foreign policy war cry western biases which are inherently false and deliberately toxic towards china doesn t help too they probably wanted to destroy the reputation of the ccp but have instead wilfully destroyed the reputation of chinese just as much they fan the flames of chinese nationalism as much as the ccp does they probably don t want it and wasn t their strategy to begin with but ccp had an easy task of gaining legitimacy from the population with that many prcs i met feel more a sense of disappointment than anger when they are misunderstood they always argue that they are held to different standards than the west and sometimes their victim mentality overrides their ability to be self critical confrontation comes when there is persistent blatant ignorance and this is applicable to everyone all the more ideas have to be attacked with facts not prejudiced feelings however the latter reaps better roi for politicans running for office in liberal democracies china be like two can play this game in a way china sees itself under attack again by an alliance of antagonisers their inconsistencies with truth doesn t do them much favours and the deserve every criticism hurled towards them but i have to say the lack of repercussions on western atrocities screams hypocrisy too confucius says don t complain about the snow on your neighbour s roof when your own doorstep is unclean in fact i find more and more people from western lib dem being the ones nodding in agreement with chinese narratives and partly also because they are more aware and ashamed of their own govt to me i think that is more effective than trying to sway overseas chinese in sea to their side making western lib dem govts lose their legitimacy from their own electorates is perhaps a much sweeter middle finger to the face than converting overseas chinese once even western lib dem citizens become pro china the cognitive dissonance will do its thing in a way some of the self destruction of western societies today in terms of crime incarceration gun laws and substance abuse doesn t spell optimism my hope is that all these squabbles between global powers will just remain as that a little bit of noise in the international arena makes life a little more interesting i mean we got kim and trump to shake hands in singapore how ridiculous and historic is that at the same time we will have enough memes to last us 6 lifetimes nice case study for social studies textbooks too this threat of chinese influence will also force some of us to reaffirm our identity as singaporeans i know i did not quite sure what i am but quite sure what i am not that i think is more than sufficient

reddit,g77h15,anupsetafternoon,the soviets thought that communism would bring about the end of nation states too they were wrong it is not correct to say the ideology is wrong only because soviet union was defeated in last cold war it was defeated because it has less hard power let me analyze why would usa be defeated in this cold war new technological revolution requires huge investment costs how can the investment cost of the technological revolution in the international world be digested the key is how many people can amortize this cost the price of new technology products is determined by the denominator the amortized population the failure of the soviet union was that the amortizing population was less than 500 million in its own system and the north atlantic system of the united states was 1 billion and then china s 1 billion people joined the western system china used to be in the soviet system and had a period of its own independent system however under the reform and opening up sino us cooperation the western system became a scale of 2 billion people which was a fundamental change therefore china s cooperation with the united states was a win win situation china s rapid development and its consumer market amortized the cost of american technological investment cost for soviet union the cost for catching up cannot be amortized and was becoming higher and higher so it must fall in the confrontation of two superpowers currently there is another technological revolution represented by 5g behind 5g s technology is the future of communications and networking and countries around the world are investing more huawei and other companies have invested heavily the 5g patents from china is around 50 the united states cannot collect patent fees anymore and the labor costs of the us led western industry supply chain are way higher how can the investment cost be amortized amortization is based on the denominator population which china has 1 4 billion and the united states has 400 million or the united states and other developed countries in total 1 billion people compared to china plus africa and the countries along the belt and road 3 billion people in total besides labor cost in the west is several times higher than that of china and its partners so we can see why the united states is on the losing side with this result prc s ideology will prevail

reddit,g77h15,adognow,it s actually a very old idea dating back decades and is termed the bastion strategy the soviet union also used a similar strategy for its nuclear submarines because they too had stealth characteristics that were inferior to that of the us navy that and the unique geography of the ussr made it very difficult to avoid naval containment despite the ussr s vast coastline most of it was iced up nearly year round the baltic and black seas were and still are useless for ballistic missile submarine patrols because they were too shallow and crowded and had chokepoints that made it impossible for ssbns to slip into the anonymity of the open atlantic ocean to the west was the giuk gap that was formerly heavily monitored by nato forces the eastern seaboard of the ussr was too underdeveloped and was too close to a then hostile china therefore soviet ballistic missile submarines tended to loiter close to soviet shores in remote arctic areas that were heavily patrolled by naval aviation and naval forces china faces the same problem as the soviet union did and russia still does china s geography is also locked in by territories island chains that are not controlled by allied countries these islands termed the first island chain are taiwan japan and the philippines and therefore the presence of us military monitoring facilities makes it difficult for chinese submarine to leave into the relative anonymity safety of the open pacific ocean because china s submarines are not yet sufficiently advanced as to reliably remain undetected china is heavily investing in this technology and it s only a matter of time before they reach a rough parity with the us but it s likely sooner or later though since there have been significant improvements in the last half decade or so you can read a basic introduction to china s nuclear submarine posture here https www sipri org commentary essay 2015 tensions south china sea nuclear dimension people tend to think in terms of economic benefit but if the country s very survival is at stake economy takes a back seat like every country out there and perhaps more than most owing to the trauma of the century of humiliation china s preoccupation is survival if it cannot ensure its survival in a nuclear war it cannot deter the us and if it cannot deter the us it will forever be holding the short stick in any kind of economic or political confrontation

reddit,g77h15,hironyx,me too i have a friend who for no fucking reason suddenly very pro china after he went there for business trips like wtf
reddit,g77h15,Silverwhitemango,it s also comical considering how you have more western prs and expats from different countries living here now and mingling with our local culture and blending in local chinese here do not overwhelmingly dominate the population now as much as decades ago and younger generations like me 26 years old are more western liberal leaning than communist so whenever the ccp tries to stroke up loyalty to the mainland it s really ineffective as only the older generations of sg chinese who are slowly dying off are the ones more likely to buy into that propoganda
reddit,g77h15,swiftrobber,you mentioned that you have prc friends and you have studied in prc do you share lky s sentiments about singaporean chinese not being able to level with prcs on a spiritual level you have some really good insights on these matter so i thank you for posting

reddit,g77h15,aljorhythm,this absence of long history of major foreign intervention and supposed non threat is also a myth it is very human to fight for power and fight to keep the power somehow there is an impression that china was poor and just quietly working hard and is somehow so specially different from all other civilisations kishore has implied this i must admit this is highly political but just look at taiwan hongkong xinjiang tibet inner mongolia ccp even caused a religious schism by appointing a leader of tibet buddhism the imposition of cultural hegemony is very sinister it looks very nice but it is only because any movement is very brutally crushed the question is whether the system has a propensity to go towards such practices foreign intervention and whether there will be protections for excess whether if they could do it they would the answer is of course not certain but it might be very dangerous the ccp has so much power if somebody like trump is in charge it will be game over some might even argue china is not that far away there is china nationalism and exceptionalism no different from many other places but just look into relatively near history china s history is complex just like any human society https youtu be c_8y5oyfsw0 china never looked like the current china for thousands of years in many periods there were multiple warring states

reddit,g77h15,Gogettrate,they are pro china because malaysian chinese live as second class citizens in malaysia due to their ethnic status as non bumiputera compared to singaporean chinese who have equal rights under singaporean law if malaysian chinese were more secure in their malaysian identity rather then continually treated as second class citizens foreigners in malaysian identity politics fighting they wouldn t constantly be looking for a third party china to help them if malaysia wants to secure the loyalty of malaysian chinese they need to end the bumiputera laws and treat all malaysians fairly
reddit,g77h15,hackenclaw,it is not really only malaysian chinese thing all malaysian are generally a little pro china because general population in malaysia do not like usa may be because of the middle east issue so you can assume we end up tilt a little more towards china that doesnt mean we are full china puppet like pakistan
reddit,g77h15,Glenn_88,they will probably try to do what they did to the african countries
reddit,g77h15,thrashweed,hahaha the reason singapore is not involved in bri is not because we are not important accepting bri means aligning with china which pap doesnt want need it furthermore sg spoke against their actions in scs which piss china off to a degree as well and all of this is because of our location importance and non alignment with them that forces china to hedge risky investment on other countries even if their belt and road is successful kra canal land route sea route through singapore will always still be more efficient of course china will be self sufficient heck they can close border now and still survive however the majority of their trade where their money comes depends on export imports through sea route where sg is nicely in the vital point again in the event of war sg is again are part of a few strategic points the usa aircraft carrier conveniently parked at changi including taiwan japan able to threaten china

reddit,g77h15,confused_cereal,take japan for example i think we all acknowledge that japan was kinda shitty an understatement but a general consensus during wwii but japan is still an ideal holiday destination for most and that s enough to say that japan s foreign policies have succeeded in their aims as long as we are not boycotting japan because of their war crimes they have achieved what they want i m not quite sure the generally positive views towards japan are solely or even largely because of its so called soft power especially not the type that you mention anime food tourism etc if anything its more of a combination of i the senselessness of blaming japanese today for wwii related atrocities committed by their great grand parents ii the lack of a military capable of offensive strikes and hence fewer overt threats against its neighbours the most you have are occasional trade squabbles with korea iii generally being respectful of international institutions and iv not persistently trying to alter the status quo also i don t know why people associate soft power with things like culture and anime and whatnot seriously do you know how ridiculous that sounds soft power does indeed exist but rarely is it as soft as you d expect for example singapore s soft power lies largely in its good international repute its perceived integrity when it comes to international dealings far beyond what most countries its size can achieve saying that anime kpop food is central to japan s soft power is like saying hollywood is central to america s soft power

reddit,g77h15,Zackereum,i see so we are talking foreign influence here and you decide to claim that singapore is self sufficient in all aspects of military needs i m not sure how you inferred that because i never claimed that in fact i was stating we were not self sufficient hence the need for us to import jets from the us so because us influence is everywhere we have no choice but to accept it but when china influence is here we need to be wary hypocrisy much again you are claiming things that i did not say stating that country x is very influential does not mean we have to accept it the nature of the influence matters too influence through cultural and economic means that is not at the direction of the us government have very different motivations compared to covert political influence op himself has already stated that u s has previously tried to influence our elections the topic at hand is on china s influence which is detrimental to our stability it doesn t mean we need to completely lean on the u s things need not be binary
reddit,g77h15,felinousforma,the thing i worry about is that china has a very shitty standard for working culture work life balance and if it s rise forces people to adopt a similar standard i would pretty damn concerned watching american factory has provides a fascinating viewpoint into the styles and expectations of workers i really hope to never have to revert back to working 6 days a week a similar situation was when lazada was bought over the difference in working styles has caused it to falter because of different working culture

reddit,g77h15,mljh11,malaysia is a malay country is exactly the fucked up mindset that has created so many social economic and political problems that have plagued malaysia and will continue to plague it for years to come so no as a chinese singaporean i will happily tell you singapore is not a chinese country especially not because some twit on the internet who likes to use the word woke as if it were going out of fashion says so take that stupid short sighted and shallow notion of yours and peddle it elsewhere

reddit,g5ukge,boyshawn,this sounds pretty reasonable before the always mask on policy i have witnessed that the fitness corner in the choa chu kang park has been condoned off now this just extend to everything except the walkway itself a measure to ensure absolutely no unnecessary movement during this ecb period i have heard story that people who just want to take a breather drove their cars far far away just for a ride then smoke in the car park i think that smoking in the car park is okay but the government explicitly tells you to stay within your neighbourhood and they don t listen hence the ban all measure
reddit,g5ukge,SuaSponte315,i was going out for a drive and doing some laps at the parks then go home i thought it was reasonable especially since i don mask and went only off peak hours and after checking the nparks site for how full it was i also stick to my nearest parks but still driving needed to reach any of them from my place so still neighborhood park imho a better approach would be close them on weekend keep open on weekday off peak hours but i get it no point getting upset just adapt
