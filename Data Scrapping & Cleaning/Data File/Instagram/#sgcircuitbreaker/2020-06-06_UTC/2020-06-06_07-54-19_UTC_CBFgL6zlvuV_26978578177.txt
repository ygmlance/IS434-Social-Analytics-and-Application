• Pineapple Rum Cake • .

A few days ago I was struck with an insane craving for sweet pineapples and a moist butter cake. My first attempt at merging the two went surprisingly well. Caramelised sweet pineapple chunks cooked to a reduction with authentic Jamaican rum provide a whole new dimension to the moist and fluffy butter cake. The generous topping of soft and tender pineapples in rum glaze had me going back for seconds, even though each slice was large and packed with flavours that knocked my taste buds out. This particular bottle of Jamaican rum I used was not too overpowering; it did not steal the limelight from the sweet and tart pineapples. The flavours from the glaze steeped into the cake and a few days later, the aromas had intensified nicely. This one's definitely a keeper! (Pun intended!) .
