It was a great time of laughters at @ourhappykopitiam 12th Episode on 6 June, joining our guests for casual chat about the Government’s efforts to accelerate digitalisation in Singapore, and how we will work together with all Singaporeans - our workers, seniors and Hawkers in our digital journey with Minister @s.iswaran, @yewhuatlim and @you_yi 😊😂❤️
