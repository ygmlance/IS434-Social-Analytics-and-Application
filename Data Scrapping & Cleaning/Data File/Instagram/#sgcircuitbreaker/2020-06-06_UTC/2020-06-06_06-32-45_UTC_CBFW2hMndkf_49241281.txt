I'm a mom who is a super light sleeper and I think most mummies here can relate.

Ever since the birth of my 2 little girls I've been on high alert 24/7. This takes a huge toll on my uninterrupted sleep hours (which are basically non existent) for the past almost 5 years.

Now that both are a little bigger and they somewhat sleep through the night, unless sick, I still find myself waking up at the slightest noise.

I've tried so many things to loosen and relax and fall into a deeper sleep but nothing helped.

That's when I chanced upon this Sleep Tea from @yourtea and Melatonin from @cleanfoodhaven (disclaimer: please do take everything in moderation and only when needed). The Sleep Tea is very light, caffeine free, has a hint of sweet licorice like taste and a clean finish. Which I super like because it does not leave a bitter or dry after taste. Just the smell alone has a relaxing effect.

Restless people with insomnia or people with high levels of interrupted sleep out there. Try this!

Also adjusting your sleep post CB is going to be a routine change for some of us.
