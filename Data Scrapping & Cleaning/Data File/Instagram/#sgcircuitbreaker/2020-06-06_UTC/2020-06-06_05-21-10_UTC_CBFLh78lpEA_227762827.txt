Essential oils may alleviate the symptoms of stress and anxiety from everyday challenges we faced. They are not meant to replace traditional treatment such as therapy or medical treatment, but to complement those methods. 
4 common methods of delivering essential oils are:
1/ using a room diffuser to fill your room with relaxing and calming scent to ease body and mind. 
2/ breathing in the benefits from a bottle of essential oils or placing a few drops in the palms and breath in. 
3/ massage onto chest, neck, wrist, sole of feet, and behind ears to experience relief. 
4/ add a few drops to carrier oil and drop to bath tub before getting in. 
Try experimenting with different essential oils to find what works for you. ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±
