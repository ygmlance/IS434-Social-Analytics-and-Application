other treats during #sgcircuitbreaker. discovered how much I really like kouign amann when it's done really well. and had other mind blowing pastries by @lematin.sg @obamatin. sadly they missed out on sending me the sauce for the bread pudding though so there was no amazake taste; guess I'll have to try it proper next time. ☺️
