Q: What do a mop handle 🧹, a bedside platform 🛏, a pair of socks 🧦 and a sack of rice 🍚 have in common?
A: They can be the everyday things to help you get movin’ and perspiring, especially during this circuit-breaker when getting your heart rate up might pose a challenge 💪

If you missed our first home workout instalment by our colleague Timothy Quek, here’s another to challenge yourself. Perfectly doable with the help of four household items and two different intensity levels – so there’s just no excuse. Try it! 😉
