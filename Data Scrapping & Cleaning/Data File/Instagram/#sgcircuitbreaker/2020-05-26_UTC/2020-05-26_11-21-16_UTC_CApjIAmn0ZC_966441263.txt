Challenging myself to make Thai style Pandan Leaf Chicken. Not bad for a first try. Surprisingly my saltiness level is spot on, but colour of the chicken wise not dark enough. May need to tweak the marinade abit. Also, learned a few lessons (1) use chicken thigh for these. Chicken breast is too dry (2) Smash lemongrass and leave them big in flavour for marinating, and for ease of removing (3) Oil fry beats air fry hands down. I air-fried these as i got no confident oil frying at home yet (4) good cooks need to have good craft skills too. Pic 1 is post fried, Pic 2 is pre fried
