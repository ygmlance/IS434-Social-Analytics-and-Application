26/31 - Swing Batter Batter Swing
Prompt: Whats a memory of collective ritual that was meaningful to some part of your identity?
Reaction: Since young, sports taught me a valuable lesson. And that is no matter how much effort you put in, it does not guarantee you success or victory. Because your opponent will likely be putting an equal amount of work or even more. This nuance was made clear especially so in softball. Where you step up on the plate and all those time in training can go to waste in that timespan if your not focused.

For #circuitbreakermay, i've decided to take on an experiment in abstract imagery using the prompts from #theisolationjournals , to inspire me from their writing. During the #ecbm (extended circuit breaker measures) that will be in place in #singapore for the month of may.
