Challenge: “Triple layered clothing (e.g coat + cardigan + dress, vest+ suspenders+ overalls? 😂)” from @theneonbear, thank you! 💝

I actually love this look, it’s super zen and minimalist, plus it’s SUPER comfy… if I didn’t live in sunny Singapore. 🤦🏻‍♀️ My hair is actually like this most days while I’m at home during this circuit breaker, and I decided to leave it in because it fits in with the effortless vibe I was getting from this outfit.
