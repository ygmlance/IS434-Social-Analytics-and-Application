Just admiring my @baaronovitch books. It was the book cover of #riversoflondon that got me interested at the very beginning (don’t judge a book by its cover, I hear you cry!). I like maps. And then the rest is history. It’s a bit hard to get these books in #Singapore so I’ve bought the missing titles through #bookdepository . I’ve enjoyed these and am looking forward to the next book after #theoctoberman . My mum is now reading them and she has just finished the first book. Onward to #moonoversoho . #covid19 #stayhome #stayhomeandread #sgcircuitbreaker #readingisfun
