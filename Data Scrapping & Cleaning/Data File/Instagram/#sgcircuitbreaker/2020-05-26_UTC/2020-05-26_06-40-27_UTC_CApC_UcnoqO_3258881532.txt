It is the third time our government has distributed masks to the community since the pandemic started. The circuit breaker has also been proved fruitful. However, we still need to stay vigilant. Our lives has not completely returned to the normal we knew. 
Thank you to Singapore government for your efforts amidst this pandemic.
I really appreciate it.
I respect you.
I support you.
(English translation by my son)
