Another bucket list down!

Thanks to #sgcircuitbreaker I had the chance to perfect many of my bucket list dishes.

#roastpork #roastporkbelly #烧肉#siuyuk #siuyok was one of them.

The previous roasted pork was always either too salty, too bland or had issues blistering.

With this, I think I nailed it! Perfect siu yok and evening char siu! For the first time, I made char siu without using the commercially prepared sauce cos I didn’t know it had run out. And omg it was so good too!
