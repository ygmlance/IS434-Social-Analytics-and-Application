Studs for a fellow book lover. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” #thelittleprince

And further readings below on the box with three holes, and the hat - or the boa constrictor who has swallowed an elephant. Because I am/was a book nerd / former Lit educator, I see it almost as my duty to share 🤓
--
The pilot attempts to ask what the little prince is doing there, but the little prince insists that he draw him a sheep. The narrator obliges, but the little prince rejects his first three attempts, saying that the first one is sickly, the second one is a ram, and the third one is too old. Frustrated, the narrator draws a box with holes for air and tells the little prince that the sheep is inside. To his surprise, the little prince is delighted with this drawing.

The little prince's ability to imagine a sheep in the pilot's drawing of the box directly contrasts the grownups' inability to tell a boa constrictor from a hat. The little prince is able to see the essential aspects of each drawing, delving into their details and their deeper meanings rather than settling on surface appearances.
