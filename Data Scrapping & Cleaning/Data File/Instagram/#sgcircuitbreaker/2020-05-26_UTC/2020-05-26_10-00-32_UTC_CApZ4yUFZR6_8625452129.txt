Having neither gin nor vermouth (nor the olives for that matter) to put this olive brine to good use, I did the next best thing: This Double Olive Bread from @huffpostlife. Sub the chopped olives with some Chinese preserves olive vegetable and added any herbs that need using up. And I’m fully on the #nokneadbread bandwagon now, so mixed, proofed overnight in fridge, shape, 2nd proofing and bake in the morning.

**Note: Not wanting to waste the brine, I used more than indicated in the recipe. You may have to reduce the amount of salt if you’re doing that .
