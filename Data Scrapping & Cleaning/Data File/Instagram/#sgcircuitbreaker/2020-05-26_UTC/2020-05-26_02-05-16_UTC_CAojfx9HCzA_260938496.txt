Will the CBD still be as peaceful on a weekday morning after the Circuit Breaker?

Took a slightly longer route today and saw a different perspective of things.

Circuit Breaker had indeed changed the habits of many people. At 7am on a Tuesday, many were usually rushing to get to work, heading to school or even going to have breakfast before going to the office. But now most people on the streets were mainly joggers, people taking a walk or those buying takeaway breakie.

How will life be from next Tuesday?
What is the new normal?
