How cute is this bag from @smiggle_ for kids? Although my daughter doesn't go to school now due to #sgcircuitbreaker, she carries her toys in this from room to room. She received it on her 2 nd birthday party from a family friend and she loves it since then. It is a bit transparent so that you can see what are the stuff inside. It has slots for snacks and her milk carton too if we are going out. The colour and design is super attractive.
