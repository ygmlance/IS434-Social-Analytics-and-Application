We're back on 2 June!!! & we can't wait for everyone to get their power on 🥳🤩💪.⁣
⁣
Your health & safety is our top priority. As such, we'll be taking some necessary measures as we re-open:⁣
⁣
1️⃣ Wear masks at ALL times 😷 SafeEntry for check-in and check-out ☑️⁣
⁣
2️⃣ PMs can only come during their allocated time slots - we will be calling you on 1 June to confirm this ⁣
⁣
3️⃣ Seats in the clinic are at least 1m apart (as per what we did pre-CB). We will also ensure space outside the clinic for PMs waiting for their turn ⁣
⁣
4️⃣ Temperature taking for all; anyone feeling unwell will be sent home 🤒🚫⁣
⁣
5️⃣ Wipe down the adjusting table after every adjustment. Increased frequency of centre cleaning 🧽🧼🧹⁣
⁣
6️⃣ Extended adusting sets in evenings and on Saturdays to minimize crowds ⁣
⁣
7️⃣ If you will like to book your first check-up with us, click on the link in bio to book today! You can also WhatsApp/DM us and we'll get back within 1 business day⁣

We know this #circuitbreaker and #WFH experience must have been difficult for everyone - we felt it too! But don't worry, we're back and we can't wait for everyone to reach their #fullpotential 🥰⁣
