When I showed my kids the Arashi Storytime, they are very amused by the lottery ladder part where the members randomly assigned themselves to a character role. It is commonly known as "Amidakuji" (Amida's halo) in Japan. M4 will always ask me to draw the ladder so he can play this with me. He likes to add a lot of lines so that can be quite tricky.‚Å£

This is a fun and low-prep visual tracking activity you can do with your kids! I wonder who will do the dishes today... ü§™‚Å£
