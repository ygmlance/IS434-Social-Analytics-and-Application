Pre-covid...(The end of Lockdown is near)
.
.
.
Sometime in early March before the lockdown happened in Singapore, I was able to head out to the southern island to explore the beauty that is St John Island for a 2nd time.
.
.
.
Saint John is one of a chain of island located in the south of Singapore. It was also where Raffles dock his ship before coming in to Singapore.

.
I miss going out on adventures like this.
Stay safe lockdown is ending!

More post coming when I can get out post-lockdown.
