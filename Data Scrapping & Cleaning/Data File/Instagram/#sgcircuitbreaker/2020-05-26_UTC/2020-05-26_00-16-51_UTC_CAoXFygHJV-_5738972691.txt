Had @youbloom.sg recreate this photo and makes me realise how much I miss seeing my friends.  Really hope we can see each other soon even it's just a quick catch up. 
Also I hope everyone out there is staying sane, not long to go so we can do this ðŸ’ª

I'm lucky that I've rediscovered my passion for making again and it's really made this whole CB a lot easier to handle.  Hope you guys have found a little hobby which has kept you guys busy mentally.

Anyway do go check out her work @youbloom.sg as now is a time to support anyway we can.
