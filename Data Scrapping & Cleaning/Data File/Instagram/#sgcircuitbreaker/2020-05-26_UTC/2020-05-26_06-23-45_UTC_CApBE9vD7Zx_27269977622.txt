Missing the wonderfully clean and delicious food 🍱from @mujisg. When they opened their huge store at @jewelchangiairport , my mum and I went to check out their cafe for the first time.
.
We were pleasantly delighted to see warm and cold dishes made with seasonal produce🍁 at the cafe. Love their fish items and lightly-tossed salads 🥗.
.
Most of all, we miss the simple act of #diningout. For now, it looks like we will be #diningin through to june in #singapore 
What #muji stuff do you love guys? I really dig their milk tea too 🍹. Could do with one right now🤪
