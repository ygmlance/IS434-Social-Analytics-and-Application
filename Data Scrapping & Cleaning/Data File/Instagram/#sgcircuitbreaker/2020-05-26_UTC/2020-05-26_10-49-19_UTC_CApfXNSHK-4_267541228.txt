#mamarazziTV | Circuit Breaker Hair Trend

Hairdressers are back to service but what happens when you are too lazy to go out for haircuts now that you are so used to staying home? Since there is no haircut delivery service, #sgmamarazzi, an experienced hairdresser (cut her son x1, did a botak style for her father-in-law x1) comes to the rescue!

It's far from nice but hey at least it can potentially be a father and son twinning style (if her toddler allow her to cut his hair again ðŸ˜†)! Who else cut your spouse's hair or had your hair cut by your spouse?
