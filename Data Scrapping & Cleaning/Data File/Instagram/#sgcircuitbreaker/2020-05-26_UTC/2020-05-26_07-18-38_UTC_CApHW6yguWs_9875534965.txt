Hi guys! We hope that you've been keeping well. As much as we miss seeing you in person in the library, unfortunately the library still has to close during the first phase of Singapore Safe Reopening from 2 June. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

No worries though, if you need any help with online resources or other things, do not hesitate to DM or email us at ls@nafa.edu.sg!⁣⁣⁣⁣
