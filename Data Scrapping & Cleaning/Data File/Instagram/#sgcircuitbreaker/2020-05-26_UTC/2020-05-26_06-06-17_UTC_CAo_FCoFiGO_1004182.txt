Lor Mai Gai
.
One of my favorite dim sum but so few places give it much respect. When @pameliachia was doing her live cook along I was still in the hospital but I watched the whole thing while being high on painkillers.

Today I finally made this, with homemade char siu. Still can’t taste or smell anything due to my surgery but according to @kvijaynathan it’s very good.

Recipe at @sgpnoodles if you want to give it a go.
