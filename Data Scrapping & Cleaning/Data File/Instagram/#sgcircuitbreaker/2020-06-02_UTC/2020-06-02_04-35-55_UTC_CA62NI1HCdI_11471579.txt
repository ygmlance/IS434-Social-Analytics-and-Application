Learning how to leave the house again because today marks the end of the circuit breaker and the start of Phase 1! 🙌🏽 ⁣
⁣
Coincidentally, today also marks the 60th TikTok video that I’ve done in a row! 😱⁣
⁣
I hope I’ve entertained you guys throughout the whole circuit breaker! ⁣
⁣
Now I’m thinking, should I go for 100 TikToks in a row? 🤔 ⁣
