We keep our Kombucha orders limited every week in order to ensure quality in every batch. 
Fermentation takes time, even more when brewed in small batches.
.
We seek your patience as we try our best to allow all of you to get your hands on our Kombucha as quickly as possible ðŸ˜‹ In the meantime, try our Milk Kefir! We promise youâ€™ll love it!
