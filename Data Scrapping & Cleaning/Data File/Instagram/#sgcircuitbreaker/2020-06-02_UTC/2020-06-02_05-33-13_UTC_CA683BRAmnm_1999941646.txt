The weather is so good today, glorious sun and clear blue sky.. The circuit breaker ended and we were heading to grandma's (across the small park from our place). More toys for the older one there.

Kasumi belle and Miss Fong convertible tote, my favourites have come along. 
Charlie's cross carry - very supportive with low gsm wrap! I'm not a precise wrapper. But baby is fast asleep so it's good enough.
