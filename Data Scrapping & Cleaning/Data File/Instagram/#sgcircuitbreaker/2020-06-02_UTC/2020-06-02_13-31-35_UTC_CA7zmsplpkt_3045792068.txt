It was so nice seeing everyone back in our centres today! ⁣🤗🥰

Thank you for patiently bearing with us as we ease into the new measures – we want to ensure that everyone can get their powers turned on in a safe environment. 💪🏼⁣

Please continue to adhere closely to your adjusting timings to help us manage traffic flow🚦 and don’t forget to use SafeEntry to check in and out of our centres! (psst – pro tip: it’s faster when you use the SingPass app📱) ⁣
