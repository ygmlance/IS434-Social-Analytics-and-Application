At the night of International Day for #ProtectionofChildren (#InternationalChildrensDay) (1-Jun-2020), our 3 year-old daughter made this drawing of #secondhandsmoke entering a house (she asked me how to spell "HOUSE"). Neither her older brother nor I asked or suggested her to draw it, perhaps she got the inspirations from seeing (1) smokers standing just next to our HDB block from our closed windows or (2) her brother who dreams for #smokefreeSG, doing his best to create/write/draw and find solutions instead of complaining. It was a rainy day in Singapore on 1-Jun-2020 (the last day of #circuitbreaker) and I tried several times to open our home's windows so we could enjoy some #freshair but I had to close them immediately after a few seconds as I could smell second hand smoke. We did not even have a break during the #WorldNoTobaccoDay on the day before. I am doing my best prevent our children from being #tobaccoExposed through prayers for smokers too so they want and could #quitsmoking, politely requesting them who smoked outside (when we were supposed to stay at home) not to smoke below our windows (keeping in mind the importance of harmony among neighbours), writing to leaders (for every smoker whose secondhand smoke harms my children, I see it as a message to write for a better tomorrow), closing our home windows and doors for almost whole day, switching on the air filters, what else can I do? We hope that children in Singapore will be safer from secondhand and #thirdhandsmoke than ever.
