Colour is a deep and mysterious language that will directly influences our dream! Seeing colourful flowers is like seeing hope, as spring arrives, it symbolises an opening up and a new beginning! 😍👍🏻

Congratulations to Singapore and all Singaporeans... today is our first day after 56 days of circuit breaker lockdown! We officially entering phrase 1 opening up! Yay... 😍👍🏻

Although to me it's still the same as lockdown... cos not able to travel not able to teach physical class, but at least I'm on celebratory mode for more things to open up today... at least, things are moving. ♥️👍🏻

Covid19 is still a threat to everyone and the world, we still need to be vigilant and practice good hygiene and social distancing. Now set my goal to wait for phrase 2 and 3 opening. We can do it together, go Singapore! 🇸🇬👍🏻
