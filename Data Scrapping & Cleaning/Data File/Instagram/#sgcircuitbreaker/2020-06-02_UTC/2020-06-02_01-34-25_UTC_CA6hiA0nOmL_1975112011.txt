We are often asked how our story began. Years ago, a friend brought back a chocolate bar from abroad. It had a lovely packaging with letterpress details, usually reserved for important invitation cards in an age where computerised printing is more common.

Tasting the chocolate, we immediately mistook it for a raspberry flavoured chocolate. But when we looked at the ingredient list we found only cocoa beans and sugar. There was no raspberry! We were captivated.

Back then, the only chocolate we could find at home were commercial mass-produced chocolate. Great for satisfying sweet cravings but didn’t carry real cocoa flavour. We decided to change that.

Fossa Chocolate began as a hobby, with one dream in mind: To bring forth the wonderful, natural flavours of cacao to our neighbourhood, while pushing flavour boundary to make chocolate interesting again for a population that doesn’t eat much chocolate.

That’s how we started and it continues to guide our growth today.
