On the last day of #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker (1-Jun-2020), instead of continuing to play with his little sister, our P1 son chose to write a #thankyouletter to every #deliveryworker #postman #postwoman #logisticworker, especially an Auntie who has delivered to us masks and a mosquito bat that we bought online. She always carries two big bags of parcels on her shoulders, bravely delivering essential items, rain or shine, amid the #covid19 pandemic. #our123gratitude #ThankYouDeliveryWorkers Thank you #SingaporePost @mysingpost
