When was the last time you thank someone from the bottom of your heart?

Well, I admit I haven’t done so for a while now. Living in what I will describe as a fast-paced society, I’ll often hustle through endless long gruelling days. Consequently, I’ve taken some things for granted.

Emphatically, this circuit breaker made me slowed down my work rate and to embrace the little things in life - I don’t need anything to be happy; just be happy.

Likewise, if our actions can spread happiness to our surrounding people, why not? Therefore, let’s bring joy to someone around us today. Sometimes, a simple smile is more than enough to lit up the person’s day.

Meanwhile, I’ll be ending the regular posting as circuit breaker comes to an end. I hope you’ve found some of these content to be helpful. As always, drop a comment if there’s anything that I can improve on, or if you have any topic suggestion. Stay safe! ❤️ 📖 Today’s Read:
