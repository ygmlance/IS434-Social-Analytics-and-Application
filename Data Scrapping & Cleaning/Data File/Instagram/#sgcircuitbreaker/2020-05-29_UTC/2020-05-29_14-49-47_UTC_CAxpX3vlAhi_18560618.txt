Circuit training through the circuit breaker.

HIIT has been a big part of my workout routine during this period to make up for the reduced activity level throughout the days staying at home esp when I don't diet strictly. Really love that you can burn a great deal of calories in a short period of time plus the fact that I'm not a fan of running.

I will alternate between HIIT and abs circuit every morning and have another training in the evening targeted at muscle toning/building.

What kind of training have you been doing this circuit breaker? 
Anyway great news ytd when govt announce that phase 2 might commence earlier. Fingers crossed that we all get to go back to the gym and smash some weights soon.
