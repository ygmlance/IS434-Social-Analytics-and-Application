What has CB done to u & ur pet?
We have been stuck at home for a while now so initially Sergeant got a little whinny when one of us leaves home for errands or when Big Boss goes out for cycling. 
Thankfully, he is better now. He knows we will be back just like the "old time" before CB.

On the other hand, he became cheekier. 
Since Big Boss has Zoom meeting almost every morning, Big Boss does the morning feeding at his usual feeding time and I get a few more hours of beauty sleep.
But this cheeky boy has his temperament. He will not eat until I wake up, even if that means way past his breakfast time.
Maybe the food tastes better if it is fed by me?
Anyway, I'm not sacrificing my beauty sleep for him. Big Boss continues with the morning feeding but if he decided to wait then he waits.........in hunger ðŸ˜†
