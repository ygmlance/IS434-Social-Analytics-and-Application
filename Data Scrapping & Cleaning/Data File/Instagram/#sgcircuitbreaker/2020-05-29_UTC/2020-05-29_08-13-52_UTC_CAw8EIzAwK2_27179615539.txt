Jelly Art ~Brawl Star Spike~

A surprise for my nephew 😆🌵
.
.
Occasionally I will bring over a jelly cake during the weekend dinner at our parents’ place. The kids simply love it and finish up the jelly very fast.

One Saturday when we arrived, Nephew Tai came up to me and asked if I have brought along a jelly cake. That was when I found out that he really loved it and such a coincidental that I did bring along one that evening.
.

And so for Nephew Tai’s birthday, I decided to make one especially for him. Asked his mum what is his favorite cartoon character right now, and she said “Brawl Stars!” Admittedly I am pretty clueless what’s in Brawl Stars other than knowing that the kids and their cousins like to play this game! Needless to say, I have to turn to the older kid for his recommendation which character is most interesting to them 😂
.
.
Their unanimous answer was “Spike”, and I could tell why... it’s a cute cactus character holding another mini cactus as his weapon in the game. I decided to recreate this Spike with its spiky body (he is smooth in the game) to make him look more like a cactus. The sliced peaches are like beams of power radiating out from him 😄
