Mango Chilli cooler.. That's what I named it..
I had this drink in last summer on our vacation since then we became fan of this drink😍.. it had some fashionable name in the menu card which I don't remember😄..so maine namkaran kar diya as a Mango chilli cooler❤..
This is my best memory from last summer💕.. sadly there won't be any holiday this year..
Recipe is pretty simple..
🥭Muddle mango pieces with fresh mint & very lil chilli...
🏵Add some powder sugar/sugar syrup if required I didn't as our beloved sweet #alphonso took good care of sweetness...
💠Finally add in Soda or water on lots ice cubes.. I used water as I don't prefer soda.. but it tastes better with Soda..
💮I like to add lil black salt to this spicy refreshing drink to enhance the taste..
This is a great treat those who like spicy drinks.....
