Friday's dinner indulgence - Original Lobster Rolls from @burgerandlobstersg! In my personal opinion, the best item on the menu is the lobster roll! The lobster chunks were generous and fresh and the lemon mayo butter sauce went very well with them. Only downside in our order was the fries which were too hard and my teeth hurt from eating them. Otherwise, it's a really satisfying meal!

While they have islandwide delivery, the delivery fee is calculated by distance and it costs $13.70 to deliver from their Raffles Hotel outlet to AMK. Thankfully, Grab is offering $10 off islandwide delivery till 1 June and we only had to pay $3.70 for delivery!
