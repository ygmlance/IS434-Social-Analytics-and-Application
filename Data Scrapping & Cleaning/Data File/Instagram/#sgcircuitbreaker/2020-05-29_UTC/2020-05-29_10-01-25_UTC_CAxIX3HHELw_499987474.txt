Challenge: “What you would wear on the PROWL if u were a FUCCBOI” from @jontan.co, thank you! 💝
.
The sky didn’t have to go so hard while I was shooting these but she went OFF.

Behold: my fuccboi lookbook.
.
I felt SO RIDICULOUS shooting these looks!! Everything from the outfits to the poses are so not me 🙊 I dressed up as 5 different personas (based on my research into fuccboi culture): The Gym Bro, The Urban Lumberjack, The Motorsport Fuccboi, The Sweater Weather Fuccboi, and The Summer Sexpistol 😂
.
This is the last of the challenges from you guys!! The next series I’m doing will be recreating iconic Asian TV/Movie characters, so excited! 🎉
