Went on a mummy & son date (to the hairdresser) with Quinton today... Helper dressed him up to twin with me after she saw what I was wearing... so sweet of her!

He’s usually more well-behaved and so much easier to manage when he with me alone. Funny that he acts this way. It’s like he is trying to seek for attention when around a crowd.

We had so much fun today. Think I should make it a point to bring him out on my own more...
