To make sure our kids continue learning and to allow support for the parents as they return to work as well, our preschool will reopen in phases from 2nd June 2020 as directed by Singapore's Multi-Ministry Task Force.  Thus, we are committed to help minimize the risks of viral transmission for the children, staff and the parents too! 
Here's our take on the back-to-school safety measures to help fight Covid19! 
Let's stay safe together! 
See you soon!
