So during this time of quarantine, I’ve been giving interviews on playing with sex toys for self pleasure to help maintain a balanced state of emotional, physical and mental wellbeing. Funnily enough, it took a global pandemic to make people sit up and realise the importance of sexual wellness as an integral part of one’s total wellbeing. BUT coronavirus or not, you ought to be taking care of yourself - getting to know your own body and discover what turns you on! 
Come next Tue, 2 June at 8pm SG Time, to celebrate the easing of Circuit Breaker (Yay!), join me and the lovely host @vonnylang of Turned-on, “An exclusively curated space for like-minded, conscious individuals to explore new ideas, share experiences, and connect on a deeper level” for a cosy chat on the basics of sex toys 101. This event is free and will be open to all genders. 
See you next Tue for a night of fun and laughter over toys and drinks! Have a fab weekend and stay Safe, Sound and S-E-X-Y! 🤓🌈✨
