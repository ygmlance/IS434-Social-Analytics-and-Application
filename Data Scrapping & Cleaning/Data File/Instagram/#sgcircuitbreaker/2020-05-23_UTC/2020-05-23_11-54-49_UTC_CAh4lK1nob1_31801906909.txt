Reading this reminds us of all the amazing places in Singapore! Inspired by #kidsbookedit ‘s theme of month (exploring), exploring this great city is something we’re going to lots of when things open up.

We love an A to Z and this fab book was written by wife and husband team that have gone on to set up a fantastic company- @retykle - that sells (and buys) secondhand luxury children’s clothes. Their stuff is gorgeous! Great book, great company!
