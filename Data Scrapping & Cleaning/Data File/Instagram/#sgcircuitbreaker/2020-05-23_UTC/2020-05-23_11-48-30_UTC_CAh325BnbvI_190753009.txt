Today I tabao Braised Duck Rice from Long House Soon Kee. I upsized with 50¢ Extra Rice, plus $1 Duck Liver. All items were good and yummilicious. The Sambal Chilli was sweet and tangy with a kick.

Soon Kee is closed on two alternate Wednesdays each month. Their next off-days on 27th May and 10th June 2020.

Hope everyone is eating well. Do stay safe and healthy.
