🍕DELICIOUS DEEP DISH PIZZAS
-
I've been ogling John's Pizzeria on my Instagram for wayyyy too long and I'm so happy to finally get some of their pizzas in my face hole. This was my celebration after I finished my undergraduate studies and I adored every bite. Also, pop some champagne to my first deep dish pizza ever. 👏

This is the John's 4-way ($42.90) and I purposely chose 2 white and 2 red pizza flavors;
😍Hawaiian (pineapples belong on pizza no matter what anyone says)
😍Four-Cheese
😍Ricotta Chicken Mushroom Bianca
😍Walnut Pesto Ricotta Parmesan

My fave is definitely the Hawaiian. I loved the thick fluffy sourdough crust and how it just soaked up all the cheese and sauces. They are super generous with the cheese too. The pesto flavor came in at a close second. It's so creamy and nutty.

I also had a Maple Walnut Snickerdoodle monster cookie. Its creamy in the center, almost like it was undercooked but it's actually perfectly cooked. 🤔 Just so magical with a delicious glaze on top and the taste of cinnamon.
