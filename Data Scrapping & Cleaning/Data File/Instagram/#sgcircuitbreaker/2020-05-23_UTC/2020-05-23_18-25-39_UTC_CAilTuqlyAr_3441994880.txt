SG Circuit Breaker - Day 47

女人啊，一定要好好的疼爱及滋润自己。桃胶不仅能增强体力、能控血糖、能降血脂、能美容养颜，也能补脑益智。今天第一次尝试烹煮黑糖桃胶莲子桂圆糖水，好好喝！会再尝试不同的食谱。

Ladies, we must make effort to pamper and nourish ourselves. Peach gum not only can it enhance your physical strength, it can control blood sugar and lower cholesterol, it is also nourishing to our skin and good for our brain.  Today I tried cooking peach gum with lotus seed, dried longan and brown sugar for the first time. Simply delicious! I’ll attempt other recipes again soon.
