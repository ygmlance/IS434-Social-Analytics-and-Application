Feeling tired in isolation? You are not alone ðŸ¤—ðŸ‘¬ I have done my research on this and so far my findings seem to point out that it is completely normal, considering all the activities you have to cope with (urgh, yes, sitting down for too long included), the roles and expectations that you have to handle, longer screen time and the list goes on... Take some break and try stretching and breathing along with some music reflections on my feed ðŸ’•

(seen here: Feeling some great energy after talking to bestie today ðŸ¤© He was in Melbourne, but really felt like our usual meal out after tennis, thanks to technology. Needless to say, our emotional connection made us feel as if we just met yesterday ðŸ™‚)

Perhaps it's time to connect with someone whom you haven't met or talked to for some time? Tag your bestie and show them how you care for one another ðŸ¤—ðŸ’ž
