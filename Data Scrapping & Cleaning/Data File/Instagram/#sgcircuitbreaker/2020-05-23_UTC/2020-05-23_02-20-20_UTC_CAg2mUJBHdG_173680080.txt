We started off with the Chicken Satay which came with six skewers of chicken thigh meat chunks, a generous amount of satay sauce and artfully placed cucumber slices.Meaty and juicy, the chicken chunks had just the right amount of smoky flavour which went well with the slightly spicy marinade. 
Next is the IKAN SEABASS BAKAR, which is whole seabass slowly chargrilled over Sundanese spice sauce. Again this is super tasty and flavorful. Goes well with plain rice and the sambal terasi.
The SIGNATURE SET (2PAX) is really good value for money.We choose the AYAM GORENG BEREMPAH SET which comes with ¼ chicken, prawn and kai lan, and omelette etc.  The other set we choose is the CUMI CUMI BAKAR SET. It also comes with Tahu Telur which is also our favourite. The Tahu Telur, simple dish of tofu and eggs was rendered more delicious than usual by the gravy provided. I loved how the outer layer was superbly crispy, but biting into it revealed a soft tofu bean curd centre. You’ll definitely want to eat each mouthful by drizzling the sweet sauce that came with the dish.  The Cumi-Cumi Bakar came with a sweet and spicy marinade. Seafood lovers will enjoy the fresh and chewy calamari pieces. Each bite was full of bouncy seafood goodness. Grilled enough to be cooked and having charred bits at some places.  As for the INDIVIDUAL SET, we tried the PANGGANG PANGGANG SET, consist of ¼ Ayam Panngang BBQ and Nasi Kuning, Gulai mixed vegetables , spicy green apple salad , Taju tempe goreng etc. Also a super value set. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the good quality of the dishes at Dancing Fish. The flavours of the dishes are robust, I am putting this as a good recommendation to order delivery or takeaway.
