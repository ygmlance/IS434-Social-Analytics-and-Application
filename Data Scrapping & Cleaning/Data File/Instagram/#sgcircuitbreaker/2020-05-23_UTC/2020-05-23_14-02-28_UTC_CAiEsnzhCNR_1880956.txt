Last year, both boys agreed to fast for half days, every weekend.
This year, I asked if they wanted to try full days, since we are all home.
To motivate them we did a different kind of reward system- for every day they complete their fast they get 2 points, half day is a point and if they didnâ€™t fast thereâ€™ll be no points for the day. For every 10 points, they can choose to either buy a toy or download a game. ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
Alhamdullilah. So proud of them.  #aydanziqry #autism  #autismawareness #differentnotless #aadilharis #storyteller #fivetastic #thenazris #sgunited #coveidraya #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhomeforsg
