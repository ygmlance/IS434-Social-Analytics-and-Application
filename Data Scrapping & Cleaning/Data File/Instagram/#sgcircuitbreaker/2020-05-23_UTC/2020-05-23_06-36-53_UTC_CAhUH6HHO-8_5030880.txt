I didnt reallly follow school's #hbl , most of time we own time own target and learn what he feels like or what i feel like teaching ðŸ˜† I am amazed by this lad's memory skills, he learnt this set of words in just 1 day ? And we probably go thru this for 10 times and we r off to play with other things. 
They always say, frm age 1 to 5, is the kid's prime years of learning. They are like a sponge & has the ability to absorb at a lightening speed ! 
Mummy is so proud of you ðŸ˜ƒ
