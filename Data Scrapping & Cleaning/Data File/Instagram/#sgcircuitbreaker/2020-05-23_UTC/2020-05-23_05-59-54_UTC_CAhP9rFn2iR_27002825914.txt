😻SHERMS COOKS: SHRIMP SALAD AND EGGS
-
Protein➡️Two beautiful sunny side up @nuyolksg eggs. I used to not like my eggs with a crispy bottom but I think I do more and more now 😂 I also have some akaebi sashimi (big red shrimp) inside my salad.
-
Carbs➡️A chocolate hot cross bun from @crownbakery! It's so chocolatey omg my fingers got really messy eating this haha.
-
Veggies➡️I have a spinach and rocket mix tossed in some Kewpie Caesar dressing. Also some of these super juicy cherry tomatoes I got from Don Don Donki.
