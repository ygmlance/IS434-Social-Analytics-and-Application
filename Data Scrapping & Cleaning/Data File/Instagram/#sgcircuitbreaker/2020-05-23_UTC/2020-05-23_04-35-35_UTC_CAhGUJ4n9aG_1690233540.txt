UPDATE:
the NDP committee is exploring letting people opt-out of this year's funpack! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . .

when i heard about this NDP Funpack thing this morning, I WAS SHOOKETH. (young friends am i using this right?) i'm getting anxiety about the potential amount of waste being generated by giving the funpack to EVERY SINGLE SG & PR HOUSEHOLD â€” that's estimated to be 1.2 million packs. and the things inside!

so please, take a moment, decide for yourself and your family if you really want / need this thing in your home. do it ASAP cos i won't be surprised if items are already being produced as we speak!
