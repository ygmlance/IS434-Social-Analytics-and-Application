CB Day 47...
It’s steak day again!!! And loving our latest investment (yet again), the Philips Air Fryer! Checkout the beef that was cooked effortlessly by the air fryer vs the ones that were cooked by my “personal” Ah Lao chef last week! 
Today’s beef was slurping juicy! And gosh.. 3 pieces like this not enuff for 2 adults and 3 kiddos.. all fighting to snatch my beloved piece of meat! 🤪

P.S: Tried 3 different parts of the cow and conclusion Ribeye is still da best! 👏🏻 #sgcircuitbreaker #staysafestayathome #airfryeristhebest #airfryersavesthebeef #creativeideaseveryday #gyjjj
