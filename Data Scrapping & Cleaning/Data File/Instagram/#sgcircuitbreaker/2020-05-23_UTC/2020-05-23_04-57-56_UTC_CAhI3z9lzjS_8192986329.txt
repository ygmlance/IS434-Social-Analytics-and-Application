Amrakhand Cheese Cake..
Yes you heard it right..
When Alphonso Mangoes are there I can't think of any other flavour😍.. #kingofflavor ...
I prepared this cheese cake from homemade Amrakhand and it tasted beyond delicious 😋😋.. It doesn't contain a single drop of cream cheese & if not told its impossible to makeout that its without cream cheese... I prepared this fusion dessert yesterday considering the long weekend but now only one last slice is remaining 😬.. I have already received a special request from my son to make it again today❤..
🏵Recipe..
Prepare Shrikhand with 2 cups hung curd & keep aside..
🔸️Break 1 tbsp china grass or agar agar into small pieces & soak in 1/2 cup or less water...
🔹️Prepare the base with digestive or crackers with butter into it & keep in the fridge to set...
🥭Take 1/2 cup or lil more of mango puree. Add in powder sugar if needed ( I didn't as mango was perfect sweet)...
💠Heat the disolved agar agar & bring it to boil same time heat the mango pulp also..
🟠Now pour agar agar mixture into hot mango pulp give a quick mix.Add in this pulp into Shrikhand & give a quick mix before it starts thickening..
Pour the entire mixture over the biscuit base & refrigerate. It will be set in arnd 2 hrs.. ( if your child doesn't open the fridge 100 times 🙄)...
Done Dona Done.. Garnish this beauty with dry fruits & saffron..
⭐This is a must try recipe... I won't use cream cheese here after... my desi flavoured cheese cake is super hit !!... Note : I didn't add any other flavour to retain the original flavour of our very most beloved Alphonso.. ❤Swipe ➡️ to see a gorgeous slice of it.. And without any confusion this fusion wala Amrakhand chhese cake is my contribution to the contest #summerfusiontreat
