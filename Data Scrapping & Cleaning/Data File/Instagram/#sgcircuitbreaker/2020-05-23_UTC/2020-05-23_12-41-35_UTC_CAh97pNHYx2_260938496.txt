Exactly 10 days left to the end of the Circuit Breaker.

This period felt a little bit like extended maternity leave, although it has been crazy having to work from home plus handle both the kids together.

I am sure that I would miss Kyleigh a lot when I return to work. Glad that I got to spend more time with her and witness her reaching many milestones.
