Mugwort Banana Walnut Cake 🌿🍌 During my family trip to Chiang Rai this Feb, we were given mugwort banana cakes on arrival with compliments of @rairuenrom organic farm.

So today I tried to create my version of mugwort banana cake with walnuts, by adding a tablespoon of mugwort powder (also bought from the same organic farm!) to the banana cake recipe which I adapted. Mugwort powder tastes similar to Matcha but more grassy, and gives the cake that unique greenish colour. 
Am so glad the taste is very similar to @rairuenrom 's version! The only thing missing is a glass of cold oat milk to go with the cake! (when I had the cake in Chiang Rai the farm also gave us organic home made oat milk which was so yummy I am missing that taste now 😭😭😭) This banana cake recipe which I used has no eggs and uses whole wheat flour: https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/eggless-banana-cake-recipe/. However, my batter was too dry so I added some milk, yoghurt and oil to the batter which was not in the recipe.
