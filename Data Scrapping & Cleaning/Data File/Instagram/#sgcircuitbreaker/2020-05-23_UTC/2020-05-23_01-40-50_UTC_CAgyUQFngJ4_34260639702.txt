Lemon pound cake - recipe from mommy oven on YouTube ! This is officially my fav bake so far as the cake is so moist and the lemon glaze rly complemented the cake so well. Not a fan of super sweet cakes so I reduced the sugar level (from 100g to 60g) and it was just right for me because the lemon glaze was also sweet ! the cake didn’t rise up as much because of the cut in sugar but I’m ok with that because it’s still moist and gd :-) I used 40g of icing sugar, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of water for the glaze and it was the perfect sweetness !
