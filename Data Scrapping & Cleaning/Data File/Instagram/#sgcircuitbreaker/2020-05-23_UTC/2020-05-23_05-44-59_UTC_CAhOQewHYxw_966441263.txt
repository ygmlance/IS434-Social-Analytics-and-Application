Today is white version. Penang Char Kuey Teow style. Leftover flat rice noodles, chinese sausage and fishcake from yesterday. So decided to just add prawns to change the style. Next time i will use fatter flat rice noodles. Thin one on photos no nice! Wahaha. And i donâ€™t like bean sprouts that it was conveniently left out. Do you like your char kuey teow black or white? Let me know
