ðŸ˜»SHERMS ACHIEVEMENT: POACHED EGG
My friends, my family, this is the first time in my life I have successfully poached an egg. For some reason I could never get that perfect eggy sphere through any method (stovetop, microwave etc). I was determined to achieve my goal tonight, especially since I had these beautiful @nuyolksg eggs.

I sous vide the egg for 45 mins at 145Â°F, then cracked it out over a perforated spoon to let the loose whites flow away. I then immersed the egg in simmering water to form the skin.

It's so yummy! The flowy yolk is the perfect topping to this beef brisket cauliflower fried rice, which is pimped with @deckerbarbecue leftover dino rib meat, BBQ sauce, king oyster mushroom, vine cherry tomatoes, mini bell peppers and half a bag of spinach. Ugh so good, I was in heaven with every bite which dripped with egg yolk, beef juices and crunchy cauliflower bits. And yet so packed with nutrients!

I also had a bowl of butternut squash soup and croutons made of sourdough bread butt ends.
