🍩THE CUTEST DONUTS
-
Aren't these just adorable!! I finally managed to pre-order these freshly fried babies from @haritts_singapore to go with my brunch today!!

From the upper left donut clockwise:
😋Original glazed
😋Pistachio
😋Ferrero Rocher
😋Cream cheese

They are so small and cute, which is good cause they are more affordable and I can try more flavors. My favorite is the Ferrero, which has an entire piece of its namesake chocolate stuffed inside. It becomes melty and is so delicious with the crunch of the biscuit and hazelnut wrapped inside a soft, fluffy, chocolate flavored blanket.

The cream cheese is also really nice, which consists of a sweet cream filling inside the donut. The dough is really yeasty and reminiscent of the Sweet Ring donuts I loved to eat as a kid. Except pimped up with all the fancy flavors. 👍

Now time to loll and bed, feeling the Doughboy I am. (Doughboy is the Pillsbury flour mascot and true to name, he is as blobby as a piece of dough)
