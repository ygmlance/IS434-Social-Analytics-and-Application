🍪1/2: LEVAIN INSPIRED (Halved batch) Recipe generously shared on @offeastandfield ig😋
Hide these from your fam. This is one HUGE decadent chocolatey cookie that no one can resist!
✻
Tips:
• I didn’t have good quality choco on hand, so I chopped up cadbury’s dark milk chocolate block (it’s so good on its own btw) and redman’s dark choco couverture in place of chocolate feves
• Do not cut back on the chocolate! (Swipe to last pic >> to see my failure)
