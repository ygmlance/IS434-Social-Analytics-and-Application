Last week of school holidays before school reopens on 2 June .

Morning brought  Linnet along to the supermarket to top up supplies.  Her first outing since CB commenced and she was surprised to see all the shops are closed except the essential services.  Different insight & experience for her.

Joined me on some workouts in the evening.  Great time spent.
