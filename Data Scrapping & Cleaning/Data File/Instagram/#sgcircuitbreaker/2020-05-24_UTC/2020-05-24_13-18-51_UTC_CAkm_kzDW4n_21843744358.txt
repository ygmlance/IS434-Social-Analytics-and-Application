From top-level executive at #LVMH to second runner-up in The Apprentice Asia with #TonyFernandes to driven #entrepreneur of #YOLO in the local F&B scene, #AlexisBauduin has come a long way indeed. 👏🏻 It all started with a mission: to stand at the forefront and lead the change in public’s perceptions towards healthy food. 🍽 Today, YOLO is going through their Series A #fundraising and is poised for enormous #growth. 🎉🏆 What do you want to stand up for? 🤔

P.S. We have teamed up with YOLO to bring you 20% off your food orders, just in time for #hariraya! 💚 They are also a Halal certified food provider. Here’s wishing all our Muslim friends a very Happy Hari Raya 😊😊😊
