Last night we were in the mood for Chinese food, so we ordered from Yanâ€™s Diningâ€”they deliver which was a big plus for us. ðŸ¥¢ First off, the portion sizes are hugeâ€”each dish can easily be shared by two people, so now we have lots of leftovers. ðŸ¥¢ Second, I adore their Old Shanghai Smoked Fish (photo 2). Next time, I will order that as my main! ðŸ¥¢
