22.05.2020 Happy double 3 to me!🎂 .
What an unique birthday to remember as being stuck at home on my birthday is not my usual style. This circuit breaker has stopped all birthday celebrations but it has instead made me feel more loved by my friends and family.❤️
.
Thanks all for showering me with gifts and food to make me fatter BUT I would finish them all for sure! Sorry I couldn't tag everyone who have sent me their deliveries but rest assured I would remember all of you cos u made me feel blissful on this special day. 🥰
.
Meanwhile, stay safe & be happy!🥰
