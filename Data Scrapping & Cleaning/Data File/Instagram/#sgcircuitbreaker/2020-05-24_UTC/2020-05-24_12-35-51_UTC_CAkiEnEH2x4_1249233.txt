A new "toy" since all I can do is run due to the #SGCircuitBreaker 
#Xiaomi #AmazfitBipS is really not too bad overall. It's lightweight. Really legible under the sun. Tracks the steps and the heart rate well. 
Anyway, the reason I got it is so as that I need not carry my phone when I run. However after my first run with it, I suspect it's accuracy as I know the distance measured might be wrong. It's proven today as I ran with it and my phone. I did 10 km in 54:47 but my watch clocked 6:95 km in 55:36. Benefit of a doubt, perhaps it's cos it kept trying to find the location. #HiiragiLife
