üç™ 2/2 BON APPETIT INSPIRED (Halved batch)
If levain is too chocolate-y for you, this basic one is a winner too. This is THE soft cookie you want to try. It boasts crispy edges and a soft chewy middle. Browning the butter brings out that umami flavour you‚Äôd never think makes a diff.

Method:
‚Ä¢Mix all flour, baking powder and baking soda in a bowl
‚Ä¢In a pot, melt butter on low heat until it foams and smells nutty. (Rmb to keep stirring) Let butter cool!
‚Ä¢When butter is cooled, mix in both sugars until glossy. Add in eggs and stir in the vanilla.
‚Ä¢Stir wet mixture in the pan into flour mixture and dump in choco chips
‚Ä¢Portion dough out using a small ice cream scoop and place in the freezer for 15-20mins. Once frozen, place in a ziplock bag and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.
