Happy Sunday guys and Salamat Hari Raya to everyone. .
My last NHS custom fundraising earring done and I'm glad to say $318 was raised!  There are still some pairs left in the shop so if they get sold I will donate those proceeds as well :) .
Thank you so much for contributing to the NHS.  I also clap for you guys 👏
