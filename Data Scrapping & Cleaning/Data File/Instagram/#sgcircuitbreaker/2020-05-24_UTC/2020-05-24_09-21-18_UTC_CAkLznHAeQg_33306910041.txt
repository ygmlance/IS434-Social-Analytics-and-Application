Using materials that we can #recycle (including a zoo map), our P1 son and his little sister built a "zoo" to play with at our home. We also had fun with virtual animals thanks to google (search #panda, click "Overview" tab, then "view in 3D space"). In 2019, our children visited #RiverSafariSingapore @riversafari.sg and #SingaporeZoo @singaporezoo.sg of @wrs.ig, each for more than once and our children were very delighted. #ThankYouZookeepers for keeping animals safe in this #covid19 pandemic. #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious
