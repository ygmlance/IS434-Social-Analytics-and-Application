Due to Covid-19 issue our helper can’t go back to her hometown and can’t have her off day as well. 
Therefore we cook this special menu to celebrate Hari Raya Idul Fitri with her.
Probably not the best but hopefully she enjoys the food 😊

🍚 Nasi Uduk / Steamed Rice with coconut milk & pandan 🍗 Opor Ayam / Chicken Curry (we use milk to replace the coconut milk)
🥔 Perkedel Kentang / Potato Fritters 🥚 Telur / Soft-boiled Egg
