Love this choreo to one of my all-time favourite songs since I caught my first ever musical, Chicago, back in 2009 ❤️ (I did my best to maintain my face 🤭😹) Thanks Viv for awesome choreo! 🤩
And I'm super impressed by the idea to put in the prison grilles!? Will share my setup for the grilles on my IG story in a bit! 😆
