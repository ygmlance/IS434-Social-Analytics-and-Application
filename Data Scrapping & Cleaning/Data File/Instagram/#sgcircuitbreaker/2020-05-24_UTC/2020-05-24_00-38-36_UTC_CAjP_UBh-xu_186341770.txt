There's no evil in religion, there's no untruth in god, there's no bad in beliefs! There's only evil, untruth and bad human beings! ♥️👍🏻

After spending some time in the middle east, and as a strong believer for religious harmony, I truly believe Islam is a beautiful religion! The five pillars of islam teaches Faith (shahada), Prayer (salat), Alms (zakat), Fasting (sawm), & Pilgrimage (Haji). ♥️👍🏻
.
None of these are teaching evils. 🥰🙏🏻
.
I sincerely wish all my muslim friends, Eid Mubarak to you and your family. May Allah open the doors of happiness, safety and prosperity to everyone in this world. Also pray for the end of pandemic, disaster and sufferings in this world! 🙏🏻
.
 Have a blessed celebration! ♥️👍🏻
