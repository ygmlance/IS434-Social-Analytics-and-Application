CB Day 48...
It’s mangoes day!!! Thank you Ah Fat 舅舅 @jackteo888  and Ah Fat 舅母 @lyanalim for the MSW mangoes! First time hear of MSW mango, but they are super sweet and juicy!!! When your kids love to eat what you also love, the plus point is that it is easier to buy food and also you will be taking in less calories since there’s limited qty to go around but the same point on the reverse is I can’t get to eat more what I love myself 😭
