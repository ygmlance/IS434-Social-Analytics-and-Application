Look for words around you and share them with your child. Start with street signs, the names of MRT stations, locations and groceries. Talk about what you plan to buy at the supermarket and include the foods that your children like. Talk about where you're travelling to and allow them to echo the destinations. Give younger children a chance too - they can still have fun with words and sounds, even though they may not be able to recognise letters! üçé#CarouselleLearning
