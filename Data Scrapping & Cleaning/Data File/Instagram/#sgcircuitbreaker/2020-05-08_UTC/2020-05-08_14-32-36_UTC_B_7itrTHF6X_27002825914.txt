🍩AMAZING DONUTS IN THE CBD
-
It's been so so so long since I ate a proper donut. Was so excited to try these fluffy dough rings from @koriosg since they appeared on Instagram sometime last year.

Managed to try most of their flavors, pre-ordered through their Oddle website:
😋Pandan Gula Melaka
😋White Chocolate with Hazelnut and Coconut
😋Dark Choc with Oreo Crumbles
😋Peanut Butter and Chocolate Drizzle
😋Original glazed
😋Peanut Butter and Jam

They're all so good, it's super hard to choose a favorite. But if I had to, I'd go for the peanut butter with choc drizzle, with is definitely strange cause I'm usually not a fan of peanut butter. But the balance of the salty peanut butter versus the chocolate is irresistible.

A close second is the pandan gula melaka. The pandan flavors come through so strongly and is so unique.
