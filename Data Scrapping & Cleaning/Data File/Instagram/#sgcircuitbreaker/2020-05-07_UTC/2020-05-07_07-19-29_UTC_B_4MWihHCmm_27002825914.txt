😻SHERMS COOKS: EASY BRUNCH PLATE
-
Carbs➡️Two slices of toasted and buttered rye cereal sourdough from @tiongbahrubakery :) I really love the crunch from all the seeds? Sourdough is just the best ❤️
-
Protein➡️Sunny-side eggs from @nuyolksg! It's my first time ordering from them after seeing them on @singaporeliciouz Instagram so many times. They are so pretty and bright orange! I also have some chicken and mushroom ragout from @thesoupspoonsg, which is so delicious with those chunks of chicken thigh. I love the creamy, stew-like texture.
-
Veggies➡️Some diced 🥑 and cherry 🍅! Love these Australian 🥑, they are just perfectly ripe too!
