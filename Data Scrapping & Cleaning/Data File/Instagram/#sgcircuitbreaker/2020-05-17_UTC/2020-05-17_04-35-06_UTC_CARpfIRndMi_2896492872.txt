Our local Hospitals have had no choice but to make difficult decisions about which patients they should treat and how to ration care. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
These measures will help to ensure they are not overwhelmed by the novel coronavirus. It also helps to protect patients and frontline workers from the risk of contracting the virus. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Many Podiatry patients have been affected at this time. Those suffering with underlying health conditions such as diabetes could be at risk if they do not keep up with their routine FOOTCARE appointments. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you or your loved ones are in need of a Podiatry appointment, we are open and we do have appointments immediately available. (link in bio) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
