When I was young, I was never good at sport and had bad memories of PE lessons. I had largely maintained a sedentary lifestyle but this had unfortunately taken a toll on my physical well-being and I knew I had to fix it. Started exercising in group classes and working out 🏋🏻‍♂️ in a gym and never looked back. Through determination, hard work and lots of sweat 💦, I have not only achieved better health, but also gained inner strength to embrace what life has to offer! ⁣⁣

Home-exercising in the meantime. Love my daily workout 🧘🏻‍♀️ and can't think of a better way to maintain the much needed balance during this period. Have you embarked on your fitness journey? 😊⁣
