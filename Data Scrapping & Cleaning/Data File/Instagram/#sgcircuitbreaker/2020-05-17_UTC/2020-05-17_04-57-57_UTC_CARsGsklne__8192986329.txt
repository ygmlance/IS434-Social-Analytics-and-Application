Dal Makhani or Maa ki dal..
The name itself is enough to brighten up  the mood😍...
One of the most favourite & popular dal.. whenever we go to restaurant this is the  one we order without fail... Creamy ,buttery & COOKED SLOWLY  that's how they describe in the menu card...😋😋 & I literally cooked it very sloooowly.. to get that ultimate flavour 😍
It goes great with Garlic Naan but we relished it with Hot hot rice... 🏵Just few ingredients & lots lots of butter & its  ready..
We enjoyed this flavorful yummy Dal served in #tableware @luzerneglobal #stayhomewithluzerne @n3fn3f ....
💮My kinda easy Recipe is in stories/highlights ..
