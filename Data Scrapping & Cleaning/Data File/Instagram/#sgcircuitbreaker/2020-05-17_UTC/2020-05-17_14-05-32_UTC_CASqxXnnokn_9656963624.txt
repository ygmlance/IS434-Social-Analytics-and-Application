One of Azel's wish is to go to Africa (specifically Malawi) when he is 21, to help the people there and be a blessing to the community. ‚Å£
‚Å£
"Whao your son is amazing, to have such a big heart for Africa at such a young age!"‚Å£
‚Å£
Whenever I hear this, I honestly don't quite know how to respond except for a humble thanks because my son is like any other child- he has his many interests (currently he is into collecting stamps, loves penguins, enjoys playing soccer among other things), he has his quirks (he absolutely detests bean sprouts, doesn't like wearing socks with too-thick seams), his strengths (warms up to people easily and enjoys talking to adults, loves solving problems) and weaknesses (has difficulty controlling his emotions at times and need reminders about his tidiness) and he still fight and quarrel with his younger brother (but are also best friends).‚Å£
‚Å£
In short, he is just a regular child.‚Å£
‚Å£
Every child is unique with their own ambitions, desires, and goals. My role as a parent is just to go with the flow of my child and enjoy the process of discovery with him through our many meaningful conversations.‚Å£
‚Å£
His interests in flags was what started us on his journey of finding out more about the African continent. Cos I too realized that I don't know much about the flags of the African continent.‚Å£
‚Å£
And because of what we do not know, we started finding out more about Africa:‚Å£
üîπborrow books from the library‚Å£
üîπresearch about the language/currency/climate‚Å£
üîπtalk to missionary friends in Malawi to find out real people's stories‚Å£
‚Å£
Our many meaningful conversations from these findings sparked his interest and subsequently his compassion for the people.‚Å£
‚Å£
Our conversations are always about‚Å£
‚ù§Ô∏è what is happening there ‚Å£
‚ù§Ô∏è who are there‚Å£
‚ù§Ô∏è how can we help‚Å£
‚ù§Ô∏è what we can do now‚Å£
‚Å£
I HEAR him and BELIEVE in him and that encourages him to talk about it more and we TAKE ACTION together. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Qns. Will he be able to eventually fulfill his dream?‚Å£
‚Å£
Ans. I honestly don't know but for now, I will love to continue to be on this amazing journey with him. ~ S‚Å£

Thank you Ms G @goshkids for having us! He was glad to be able to share his heart today.
