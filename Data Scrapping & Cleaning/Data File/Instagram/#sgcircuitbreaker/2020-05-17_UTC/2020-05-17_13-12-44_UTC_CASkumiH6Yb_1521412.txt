I’m so glad that I’m still able to do these activities with Sheldon despite having a newborn at home this week. It was made possible because I have a confinement lady! I’m thankful that @pemconfinementnanny did not fail us during this critical period. 🙏 #confinement #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #sheldonsim #2yo #29monthsold #sgbaby #sgtoddler #instatoddler #instababy #homebasedlearning
