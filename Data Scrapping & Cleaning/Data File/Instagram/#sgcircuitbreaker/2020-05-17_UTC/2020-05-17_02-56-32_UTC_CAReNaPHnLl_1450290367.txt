Our weekends breakfast used to a call away to decide which Coffeeshop to eat at and most of  #teoclanrocks and #teoscfamily members will turn up w/o fail. 
Nowadays, it has changed to a call away to ask if wanna tabao and we will pack for each family and deliver over. It’s just a pass-and-go relationship now. When can I meet my Teo clan again? 🥺🥺🥺 This is another 爱心早餐 from @yiksian ! Coupled with my favourite pack of Teh somemore! 🥰
