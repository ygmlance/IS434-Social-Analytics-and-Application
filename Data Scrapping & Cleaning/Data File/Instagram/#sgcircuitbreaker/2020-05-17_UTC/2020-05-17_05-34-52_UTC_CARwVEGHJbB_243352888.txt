🧚🏻‍♂️ Domestic Goddess... NOT! 🙅🏻‍♀️
.⁠
Cooking and cleaning takes up so much time... And I seem to always take more than the prescribed! 🤦🏻‍♀️ Recipes that indicate 'Preparation Time: 20mins, Cooking Time: 20mins' usually have me starting in the kitchen at 4PM and serving just-in-time at 7.30pm. HOW DO WORKING PARENTS DO THIS??? 🤷🏻‍♀️👏🏻😱 #RESPECT⁠

On my CB list is 'Bake/Cook once a week' 👩🏻‍🍳🍳🍰 I'm flat out by Saturday night from cooking ONE MEAL. Now I know what Hercules feels like with his Twelve Labours 🥒 Slaying the nine-headed Hydra is like me cutting onions... seemingly never ending and makes me cry 😅⁠
.⁠
🍴What DOES make me continue is seeing a physical outcome AND pottering together around the kitchen with @VincentCheokBC 🍝 So far, we've made baked salmon, (a lot of) minestrone soup and KFC chicken rice 🥞🍲🍚⁠

What beginner level recipes reap big yummy taste results for you? I would prefer not to spend half my weekend being domestic 🧹🧼😆⁠
