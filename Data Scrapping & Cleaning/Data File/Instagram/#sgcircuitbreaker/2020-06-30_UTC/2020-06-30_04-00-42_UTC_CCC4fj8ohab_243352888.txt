A mix of blah and good things came up unexpectedly this weekend 😓🤷🏻‍♀️😅⁠
.⁠
The sucky stuff: Someone I love hasn't been well again, so hello hospital 😷🏥👩🏻‍⚕️⁠
.⁠
The good stuff: 👧🏻 Hung out with my little niece, where we played "Where's 姑丈(GuZhang)“ with her baby photo album, had an insightful chat with @ZeroWasteSingapore about Sustainability 101 🌿 ♻️ and I'm hopefully one step closer to fixing my website ⁠
.⁠
Just really glad to have this man in my life, who helped me with some tediously boring website admin stuff when I dozed off 👫🏻 ⁠
.⁠
🙏🏻 What are three things you're grateful for this weekend? 🌟⁠
