A fresh, zesty bowl of Calamansi limes.... waiting to be transformed into our Teh Limau Kombucha. 

We use proprietary processes to incorporate 100% natural ingredients into our products, with rounded flavours, and full bodies, all while respecting the integrity of the product. 

Kombucha you see on shelves today somehow evolved into being branded as fizzy, artificially sweetened and flavoured tonic water. 

For as long as Le Vyr is around, we never want that to be the case. 🙇🏻‍♀️
