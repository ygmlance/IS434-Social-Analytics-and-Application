When Kombucha is under ferment, it means that most of the sugar in the sweet tea is still present and the SCOBY still hasn’t had enough time to do it’s thing yet! They are, however extremely safe to drink and would resemble the flavour profile of sweet tea than it’s usual tang.

When Kombucha is overly ferment, it simply means that enough time has passed for the bulk of the sugar to be consumed and yeasts present may potentially start to die; turning the beverage Vinegary. Reaching this point means that most of the probiotic benefits have diminished. However, there are no adverse health effects when this phase is achieved!

Through our extensive R&D, we have ensured consistent ferment throughout our small batches of Kombucha brewed. We also taste and reject batches that lack consistency and may be over/under ferment, achieving the right balance of sweetness & tang! 😌👌🏻
