The habits you formed during the circuit breaker might be causing an uptick in acne flare-ups.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Whether you have been keeping fit, rocking a new fringe, or masking on to stay safe, it is important to consider these tips to reduce breakouts and take better care of your skin.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
⁣⁣
1. Keep your workout area clean⁣⁣
⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Dirty floors and unclean exercise mats can easily cause sweat, dirt, and oil to clog pores. If you have been exercising regularly, be sure to keep your workout area clean and take a shower after to cleanse off any impurities. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
2. Let your skin breathe⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The trending #quarantinebangs may be a great back-to-work look, but they’re also a major cause of forehead acne. As the forehead is part of the T-zone, it is prone to clogging and becoming oily when fringe covers skin. Excess sebum and bacteria get trapped in this area, causing pimples to pop up. To minimise breakouts, reduce the use of hair styling products and tuck away your bangs whenever you have the chance to let skin breathe. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
3. Prep your skin before masking ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
As face masks become part of our daily wardrobe, ’maskne’ has become a common skin concern. Properly known as Acne Mechanica, these pesky spots are triggered by excess heat, friction, and rubbing of skin. While we can’t head out without a mask, keeping our skin bare, clean, and properly moisturised can help reduce breakouts. Opt to go makeup-free where possible and adopt a day and night moisturising routine — light moisturising in the day and heavy at night. ⁣⁣
