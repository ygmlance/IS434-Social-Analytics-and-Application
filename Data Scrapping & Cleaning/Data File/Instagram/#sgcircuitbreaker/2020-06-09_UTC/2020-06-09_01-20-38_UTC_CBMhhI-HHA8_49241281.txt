This mask is too pretty not to post. @breathehealthy.masks with the Breast Cancer Awareness Pink Ribbon.

I hope that for those that have somewhat returned to work you are adjusting well. And those still WFH keep being motivated!

Somehow it took me 1 whole week to adjust back to a different rhythm. It was a strange feeling, because I never expected to feel so tired. Every night I would be feeling heavy and reluctant to get up to do any house chores whatsoever.

Really looking forward to Phase 2 and Phase 3 right now ðŸ˜­
