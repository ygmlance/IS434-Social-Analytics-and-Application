Today marks the last day of my confinement. Thank you @pemconfinementnanny for the reliable service during this critical period. Having a nanny was the best reward after giving birth. I am grateful that my stomach was always filled with nourishing food and I got plenty of rest with a peace of mind. Well, all good things come to an end. From now onwards, the real battle starts. Although we are never readyðŸ˜°ðŸ˜…, but bring it on Sherelle and Sheldon! #weareneverready #justdoit #endofconfinement #sgparents #sgbaby #sgtoddler #sgfamily #confinementduringcircuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #parenting #daddybehindthelens #bareface #sheldonsim #sherellesim #2yoand1monthold
