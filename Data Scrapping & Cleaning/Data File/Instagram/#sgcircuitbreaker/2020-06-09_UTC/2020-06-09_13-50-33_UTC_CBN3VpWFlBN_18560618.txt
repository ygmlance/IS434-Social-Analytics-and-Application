Circuit Breaker shred?

The pic on the right was actually in End April/Early May which was where I reached my target weight and I have been maintaining it since as I did not want to go into too much of a deficit where Iâ€™m losing muscles.

This month has been about dialing back my training intensity so that I allow my body to take a steeper break from resistance training so that we can shock them to grow when the gym reopens in Phase 2. Does it work that way? Who knows? But if you never try, you will never know.
