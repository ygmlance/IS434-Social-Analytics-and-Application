🤩🧘🏻‍♀️😔 A whole lot of different emotions, which I haven't quite unpacked yet as the past few days have been run-run-run with lots to activate tomorrow!⠀
.⁠⠀
The one feeling I'm super certain of though is excitement about seeing my niece soon! 💖👧🏻💖 Twice weekly hang-outs with her have withered down to zoom calls, where I’ve to compete with her soft toys, building blocks and all snacks that my brother walks past with 🧸🏰🍪⁠😒⠀
.⁠⠀
🤷🏻‍♀️ Maybe I'm just not good with change? Or maybe I've done too well at making the best of this situation? 😝⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
What's the first different thing you're going to do when the gates open slightly more tomorrow? ✨⁠
