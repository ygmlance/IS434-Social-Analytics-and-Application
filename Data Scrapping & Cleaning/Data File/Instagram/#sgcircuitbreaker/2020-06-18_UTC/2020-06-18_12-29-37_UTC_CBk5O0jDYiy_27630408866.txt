My heart sank a little when I woke to the buzz of grass cutting. During the circuit breaker period (when no one keeps the grasses in check), I had very much appreciated the views of grassy knolls overgrown with dandelions and other wildflowers. Bye bye dandelions~ Well, this marks the entrance to phase 2 when the economy opens a little. I should be happy :)
