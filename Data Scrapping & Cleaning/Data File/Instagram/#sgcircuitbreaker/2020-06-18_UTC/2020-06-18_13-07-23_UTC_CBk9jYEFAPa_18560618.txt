Looks like the stage is set.

One day out to hitting the weight room.

Let's not take this for granted, wear a mask, practice good hygiene in the gym n concentrate on your workout, lock in and stop chatting, finish your workout and leave so that the next member waiting outside the gyms can come in and start their workouts.

Thankful to the circuit breaker for the opportunity to work on things I never had the time to work on and also led me to a few collaborations that's coming up so stay tune for those.

Once again, stay safe and stay active thru this period everyone!
