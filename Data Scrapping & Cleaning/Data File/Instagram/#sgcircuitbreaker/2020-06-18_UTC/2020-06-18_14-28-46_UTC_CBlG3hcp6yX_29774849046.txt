Day 73/74 of Sg lockdown (extended phase). Today at 2359, marks the end of Circuit breaker Phase 1. As we are stepping into Phase 2 in an hour+, climbing gyms are finally opening it's door.

#throwback to my resistance band that I had fully utilised throughout the whole circuit breaker to keep my joints & muscles strong. I hope I will be able to maintain my fitness, and hopefully push beyond my limits as we proceed into the uncertainties.
