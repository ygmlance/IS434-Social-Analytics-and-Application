Singapore opens up further tomorrow as we enter Phase 2, but the doors are still shut on me, and other fellow patients who suffer from chronic fever because of our conditions.
There are people out there who live with a fever everyday.
I wonâ€™t be able to dine-in or run errands at malls like others can, because my fever will get me stopped at the entrance when I will fail temperature screenings. Not that I want to go anywhere crowded or enclosed considering the current situation, but these are measures that are going to be around for a long time. Itâ€™s going to be hard for people like me to get around especially for crucial errands.
I had written to Ministry of Health to clarify policies for patients who hold a valid doctorâ€™s letter for chronic fevers but never got a response. ðŸ˜¢ So I designed this tee with @tjg.sg early last month to generate awareness. Yes, people like us are rare. But we exist. As the whole goes full-out hostile against those with fever, please donâ€™t forget that not all fever means Covid-19.
