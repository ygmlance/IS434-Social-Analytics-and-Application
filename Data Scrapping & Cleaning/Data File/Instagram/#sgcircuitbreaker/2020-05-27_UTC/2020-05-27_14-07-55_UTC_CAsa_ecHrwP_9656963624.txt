Can I have a confession to make? Sometimes when I am really busy in the kitchen, I would prepare the kids some coloring templates for them to colour in 🥴⁣
⁣
But I try to make up for it by talking with them about their choice of colours, the shapes that they have coloured in and also comparing them with the buildings around it, for this particular one!⁣
⁣
So here’s some color for this week!⁣
⁣
Hang in there, friends! We are almost at the tail end of circuit breaker 💪⁣
