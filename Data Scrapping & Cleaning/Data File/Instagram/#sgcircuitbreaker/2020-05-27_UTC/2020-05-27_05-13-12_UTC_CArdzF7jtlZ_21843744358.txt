You guys, Cedele has just launched new buns straight from the oven! 🥳 Think soft, pillowy milk and butter bread, sticky walnut & cinnamon brioches and spring onion sesame bread rolls… perfect for breakfasts in the mornings or afternoon tea. 😋😋😋⁠
⁠
They’ve also got lunch covered with tantalizing, good-for-you treats like Spicy Chicken Tom Yum Pasta ($13) and Grilled Cajun Chicken & Avocado Burger ($12). And also a multitude of essential healthy snacks like toasted coconut chips with cinnamon, salted gula melaka mixed nuts and various fresh, creamy nut butters. 🍪😆 The DIY overnight oats box also caught our eye – it’ll make a lovely gift for a family or friend during this circuit breaker period. 💝🎁⁠
⁠
We are thrilled to have teamed up with the good folks at @CedeleSingapore to bring you 15% off all food orders. Link in Bio ✨ Eat well, be well ladies. 😘
