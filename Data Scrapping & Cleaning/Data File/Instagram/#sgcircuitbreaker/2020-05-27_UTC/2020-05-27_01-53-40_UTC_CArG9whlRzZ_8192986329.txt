Kairi chi chutney aka Raw Mango Chutney..
🏵A summer mandate in our family..
This recipe comes from my Aaji (grandmother)..
In summer holidays whenever we all cousins visited her place this chutney used to be a must part of our everyday meal..
🧡She always insisted us to try her chutney over the ketchup.. & we really loved the idea..
Later we started calling this Chutney as a Aaji chi chutney (grandmother's chutney) 😀...
And now we all regularly prepare this chutney & we are trying to pass this recipe to our next generation... A real Treasure ❤..
⭐A perfect mixture of Kairi,Jaggery, chilli powder & seasoning of salt & dry roasted mustard seeds & fenugreek seeds make this chutney tangy, sweet & spicy at the same time..
💠This chutney stays good in the fridge easily for a month ( if you can save 😄)..
