We received many enquiries on our Kombucha preorders... 🤔

Announcements on more details will be made after June 3rd!

Due to the high demand and small batch brews, we are only able to do preorders so we recommend that you on our post notifications to avoid any disappointment once our preorders open again! 
We will be allocating only a fixed number of slots during the first week and the following vacancies will be for delivery the subsequent weeks after!
