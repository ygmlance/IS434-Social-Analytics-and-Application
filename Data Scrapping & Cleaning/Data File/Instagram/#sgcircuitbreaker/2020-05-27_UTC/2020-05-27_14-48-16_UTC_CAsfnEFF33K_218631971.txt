今天懒惰的我，下午煮了一锅熟的饭，里面加了午餐肉，红萝卜，玉蜀黍，蟹味菇，杏鲍菇还有调味料。不过因为有点贪心煮了1.5杯的米，结果煮出来的份量自己都吓到，因为平时的我两餐都是1杯的米😅不过因为煮出来的味道口感都很不错，一不小心就把全部的饭吃完了🙈 加上昨天的排骨香菇萝卜汤，我现在可以准备冬眠了😴

Overcooked my lunch and dinner but i managed to finished everything by myself because it’s so yummy (self-praising😝)! This pot of rice look like fried rice and taste like fried rice but i feel it’s taste better because it’s not too dry and it’s flavourful. Basically I just mixed luncheon meat, carrots, corns, king oyster mushroom, beech mushroom and some condiments then cook them in rice cooker. It’s really suitable when i’m lazy and busy at the same time! Had the rice with my pork rib radish soup, i’m ready to hibernate... #stayhome #dudukrumah #workfromhome #cookathome #eatathome #ricecookercooking #xinpeicancook #malaysiamco #sgcircuitbreaker #covid19 #goaway
