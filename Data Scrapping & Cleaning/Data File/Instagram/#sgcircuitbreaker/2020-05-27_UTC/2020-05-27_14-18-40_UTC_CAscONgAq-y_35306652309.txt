BFL’s first time: Smokin’ Boy | @threebunssg emerged as our favourite burger during our ‘CB burger test’ over the weekend 🍔 Flavourful but not overpowering; Very well-balanced with medium-done beef patty 😌 House fries is made with great potatoes paired with a bombastic-licious sauce. Completely satisfying! 📷: “Tasmanian Vintage beef patty with Dell beer & treacle streaky bacon 🥓 smoked Applewood cheddar 🧀 BBQ ketchup, smokey mayo and barang goreng in toasted demi brioche bun” #sgfoodtrend #supportlocal #sgcircuitbreaker #visitsingapore
