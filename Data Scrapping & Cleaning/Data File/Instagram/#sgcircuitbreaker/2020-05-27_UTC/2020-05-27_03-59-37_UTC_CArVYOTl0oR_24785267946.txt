Dalgona coffee, the "cloud coffee", is made by whipping instant coffee with sugar until a thick froth foams. Ever wondered if Dalgona coffee is healthier than the usual coffee? ⁣
⁣
If you follow the most commonly used recipe of two tablespoon of instant coffee, two tablespoon of white sugar and one cup of fresh milk, the nutritional value of one serving will be:⁣
⁣
374 calories⁣
14g protein⁣
9g fat⁣
60g carbs⁣
⁣
Instant coffee has to be used because of the xanthan gum found in instant coffee, which is essential to make it foam-ey.⁣
⁣
Sugar is also essential in making and stabilizing the super fluffy foam. As the sugar dissolves in the water mixture, it increases the viscosity of the liquid and increases the volume of the foam.⁣
⁣
Do take Dalgona coffee in moderation as it has very high content of sugar and caffeine. According to HPB, our intake of added sugar should not exceed 40-55g per day.⁣
⁣
So, Dalgona coffee - Yay or Nay?⁣
