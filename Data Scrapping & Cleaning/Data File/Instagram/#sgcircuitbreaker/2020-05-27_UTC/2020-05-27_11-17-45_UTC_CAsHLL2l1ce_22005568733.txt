Time flies and we are into the last week of our Home School Learning Journey. 
Our cubs had so much fun dancing, painting, baking, experimenting, exploring, planting, crafting, zooming and so much more. Thank you, parents, for your enthusiastic participation in this journey together with your child. 
We missed our cubs dearly and canâ€™t wait to see them back in school next week!
