Some of you asked me for tips on how to be productive when working from home and I thought it'll be apt to post it today cos I've been feeling so unmotivated ­Ъўъ­Ъўъ. It's my uni summer break now but I'm currently studying to become a certified personal trainer so I still need to study. So I wrote down some tips on HOW TO BE PRODUCTIVE AT HOME (if you need to get shit done):РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ

1№ИЈРЃБ Plan out what you need to do. I always do this and I find it really helpful because I know exactly what I need to do and won't waste time planning the next dayРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ

2№ИЈРЃБ Set up a fixed workstation to work. It's difficult to stay productive at home cos we view our home as a place for relaxation. So have a clean and neat workspace and only use it for work. This will help you get into the right mindset whenever you're at your workspace РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ

3№ИЈРЃБ Set a timer to do your work in intervals. Work for 45 minutes then take a 15 mins break. Taking breaks is important so that you can keep going for longerРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ

4№ИЈРЃБ If you can't bring yourself to start work, start with more manageable tasks. This way you'll feel a sense of accomplishment and generate momentum. Or you can set a timer for 10 minutes and tell yourself you'll only work for 10 minutes. Everytime I do this I end up completing the task because I get into the zone

5№ИЈРЃБ One problem I have is that I like to lie on my bed and scroll through insta (can you relate??) To get myself out of bed I countdown from 10 and once I hit 0 I'll force myself to get up. If you do this enough times it'll become a habit!РађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
I'm the kind of person who prefers studying at home anyway so these are the things I do on a daily basis. I hope these tips will help and JIAYOU everyone!!! ­Ъњф­ЪЈ╗­Ъњф­ЪЈ╗
