CB Day 51...
Daddy brought out Jaykorkor’s preloved Pororo house from the carton boxes and now it’s Mei-mei’s all-time favourite! She literally can play with it for a few hours!

One minor setback is our dear Jaydidi will come and “destroy” her peace and yes.. there goes our peace as well 🤦🏼‍♀️ Checkout how she “force” the mini Elsa hair and crown onto Lopey to make her a princess 🤣
