How did Cedele grow from a humble neighbourhood bakery 🥐 at Frankel Avenue to health food empire spanning 28 outlets across Singapore? Founded and ran by self-made entrepreneur Yeap Cheng Guat, Cedele has thrived but still remain firmly grounded in the same belief it was founded upon: helping others to eat well, be well. 🧘🏻‍♀️❣️😉⁠
