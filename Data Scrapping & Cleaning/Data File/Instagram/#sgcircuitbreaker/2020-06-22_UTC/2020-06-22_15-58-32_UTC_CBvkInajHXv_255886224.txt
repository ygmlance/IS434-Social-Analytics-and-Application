If you’d like limit your time in the salon for additional safety, you can wash your hair prior to your appointment and skip the shampoo step. Also, for those of you who get a blow-dry service, you can obviously forgo that to get you out quicker.  Additionally, hand sanitizer and alcohol pads will be provided to wipe down your phones and glasses. #crownnyc #crownme #phase2 #reopening
