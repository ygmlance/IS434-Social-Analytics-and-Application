I’m not a good writer.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
That’s a big problem considering the fact that I’m writing a post for people to actually read at this very moment.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
So what’s the solution? Refuse to share my work until I become a “good” writer (whatever that means)?⁣⁠
⁣⁠
And who decides whether or not I’m a “good” writer? Is there just one objective standard or do different people have different opinions?⁣⁠
⁣⁠
There are lots of people — and I’m not making this up — who think J.K. Rowling is a bad writer.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
She could have hid from the critics. She could have held her writing back until it was good enough for everyone to sing its praises.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
I’m sure glad she didn’t.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
I get that mastery is important, but you get there whether you practice in private or in public. Having the courage to practice in public gives you a head start in connecting with the people you want your work to impact.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
There’s no contest here. Practice in public.⁣⁠
