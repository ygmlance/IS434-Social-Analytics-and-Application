Library is a place where the books let me improve my knowledge about the world, sharpen my skills and change my attitude towards life without moving my feet! 😍👍🏻
.
Today I'm a reader, tomorrow I'm a leader! ♥️👍🏻
.
Indeed, I'm a leader of my life! I realised even tho we are small, but we can make big changes in our mindset and ultimately changed our life! 🥰👍🏻

If you think google can replace library and change our life then you are absolutely wrong, wikipedia cant replace school, WedMD cant replace clinics, hence google naturally cant replace library! 😍👍🏻

Phrase 2 has begun... stay safe and quiet especially when your in a library. Shsssss. 🥰👍🏻
