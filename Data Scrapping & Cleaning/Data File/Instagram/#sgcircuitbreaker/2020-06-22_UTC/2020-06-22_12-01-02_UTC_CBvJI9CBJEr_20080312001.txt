Virtual backgrounds help create the correct environment for presentations. It can make or break a talk, virtual product launch or a paid webinar. Your audience can see all the small details you tend to ignore and you get judged by every single detail in your background.
.
For privacy purposes or to maintain a professional look, you may want to hide your room background or your entire surroundings. Prof. Robert Kellyâ€™s background during a @bbc interview is among the most well-known examples of why people need to be able to control the scene around them during a video call.
.
The Virtual Background feature allows you to display an image or video as your background during a meeting or a webinar. The possibilities are endless so long as you have proper guidance!
