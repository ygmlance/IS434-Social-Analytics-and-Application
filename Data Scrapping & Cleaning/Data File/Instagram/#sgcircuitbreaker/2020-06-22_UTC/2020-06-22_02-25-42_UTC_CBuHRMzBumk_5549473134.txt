Another workout routine during CB with TDC Bachata group. Thanks @derricktdc for sharing with us your fitness routine.
A painful beginning all over again. Hoping to get stronger, be fit again and maintain it.

Props:
Water bottles, upgrade to wine bottles and upgrade again to 1.5L Ayataka pet bottles.
