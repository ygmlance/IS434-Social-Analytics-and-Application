Nature I miss you 🌿
•
Even with Singapore being such a green city - as I showed you the past few weeks - I must confess that I’m starting to feel trapped here these days. I’m tired of the buildings views and traffic sounds. I miss fresh air, open landscapes, endless panoramas, adventure 🦎 We are in June already and still didn’t do a single real hike (apart from here) or nature destination! We were supposed to finally have our dose by going to Bali in March and the Philippines in April/May after the beginning of our year was focused on cities, but clearly that didn’t happen 😅 another thing we took for granted! As soon as we can travel again (which is still not possible here because they’re extra careful), be ready for nature destinations cause I crave them too much right now!! Do you already know where you’ll go this summer? Are you more of a city or nature explorer?

The Cloud Forest is one of the two conservatories in the Gardens by the Bay, and by far my favorite! It hosts this breathtaking 35 meters-high indoor waterfall, the tallest in the world after Changi airport’s one (yes Singapore has both world records in this category 😂). The other amazing thing about this place is that, as it showcases plant life from tropical highlands up to 2,000m above sea level, it’s actually cold inside 🧊 Might not sound appealing to you, but wait until you experience Singapore’s outdoor heat 😅
