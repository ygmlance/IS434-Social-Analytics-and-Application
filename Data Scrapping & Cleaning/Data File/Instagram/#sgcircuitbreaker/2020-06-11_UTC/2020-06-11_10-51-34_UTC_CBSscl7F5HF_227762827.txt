Citronella Essential Oil is known to slow or prevent the growth and spread of harmful airborne bacteria while also repelling flying insects, such as mosquitos.
It eases and uplifts negative sentiments such as sadness, anxiety, and stress by relaxing the body and mind and promoting a sense of happiness.
Simply diffuse 3 drops in a diffuser to enjoy a sense of focus and calm the body and mind. 
For an invigorating massage, dilute 10-12 drops of Citronella Essential Oil in 30ml of carrier oil and massage it into the skin until it is fully absorbed, to promote the bodyâ€™s release of negative emotions such as aggression, restlessness, and sadness.

It is reputed to ease muscles spasms, such as menstrual cramps. 
Add 10 drops of Citronella Essential Oil and 10 ml of Carrier Oil, gently massage all over the body to boost immunity and circulation while soothing arthritic discomfort, back pain, abdominal cramps, and headache.
To stimulate digestion and reduce menstrual cramps, dilute 5 drops of Citronella Essential Oil in 5 ml Carrier Oil, massaged onto the abdomen in a circular motion for 1 minute or until fully absorbed into the skin.

Its fresh, bright citrus-like scent is an ideal ingredient in natural room sprays and diffuser blends. 
For an air freshener that disinfects while it boosts the mood, add 30 drops Citronella Essential Oil in a 240 ml glass spray bottle, then fill the rest of the bottle with distilled water, then spritz the mixture a few times into the air for a fresher scent and a lighter mood. Replace with new blend every 2-3 weeks. ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±
