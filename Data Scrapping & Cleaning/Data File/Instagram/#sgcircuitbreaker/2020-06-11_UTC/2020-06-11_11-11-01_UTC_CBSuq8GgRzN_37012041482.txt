We want the gyms to open as bad as you do! But for now, let's all be responsible and stay safe during this #covid19 pandemic and we'll get through it together! ⁠
⁠
Many people feel that strength training is usually associated with more experienced athletes, but that's not true ❌ at all! ⁠
⁠
Strength training has many physical, health and mental benefits and it's something that we all can do in the comfort of our own homes. ⁠
⁠
Benefits of Strength Training: ⁠
💪🏻increasing your physical work capacity ⁠
💪🏻improving bone density⁠
💪🏻promotes fat-free body mass ⁠
💪🏻increases strength of connective tissues, muscles, and tendons⁠
💪🏻improving quality of life⁠
⁠
With so many benefits, there's no time to lose! ⏰⁠
Start slowly in single sets and work your way up to multiple sets! Try out different weights and find the one that you're comfortable with. ⁠
⁠
Finally - remember to rest! You should wait at least 48 hours before you train the same muscle group once again 🙌🏻⁠
⁠
Watch this space as we have some exciting news to announce on SUNDAY and we know for sure that you don't want to miss it! ⁠
