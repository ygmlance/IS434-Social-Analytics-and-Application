Decadent lunch today from @gazette_sg Belgian food & beer - pate en croute, duck confit parmentier, burrata (ok, not so Belgian)...and of course some art historical research on the 15th-century Flemish painting of Mary of Burgundy (only child of Charles the Bold) they use on the beer label... #belgianfood #singapore #pÃ¢tÃ© #duckconfit #belgianbeer #lunchdeliver #workfromhome #lunchtime #SGcircuitbreaker #alwaysworking #ðŸ˜‰ #richfood #moreforlater #tastybeer! #mercipierre
