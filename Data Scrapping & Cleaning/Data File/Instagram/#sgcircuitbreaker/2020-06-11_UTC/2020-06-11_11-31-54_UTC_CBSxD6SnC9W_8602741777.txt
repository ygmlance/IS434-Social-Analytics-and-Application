Kiddo wanted to eat corn on National Corn On The Cob Day as we continue our conversations on respect and equality. His best friend is biracial and is moving back to the States next month so he is very worried for him and wants to help anyway he can. Weâ€™re reading books and talking about what we can do to educate everyone we know so look for more read alouds from us soon.
