Breathe. ⁠
⁠
To pause. ⁠
To make space. ⁠
To collect your thoughts.⁠
To remember. ⁠
To face the next moment. ⁠
To choose. ⁠
⁠
⁠
As we move into Phase 1, and soon to be Phase 2, let's make full use of our time to take a breather. Let's pause for a moment, reflect on what we've done and let's make great choices in the next phase of our life, especially in taking care of ourselves. Often times, we take care of our loved ones and forget about the most important person - ourselves. ⁠
⁠
So don't forget, Love Yourself! ⁠
