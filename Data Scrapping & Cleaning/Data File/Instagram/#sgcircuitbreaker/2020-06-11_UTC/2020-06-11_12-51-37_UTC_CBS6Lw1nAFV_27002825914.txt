😻SHERMS COOKS: BEEF BURGER
-
I love how easy this is to make yet how filling and satiating it is. I think burgers are demonized as being a super sinful food, but tbh I think my version is quite OK haha. (You get your carbs, protein and veggies all in one meal!) And trust me, I did not compromise on taste. 😉

Tips to making a healthier burger:
-
1. High-quality meat and buns! I used a beef patty from @thebutchersg, and brioche buns from @bakerybrera 😍 I even have a generous dollop of @thelokalsingapore 🍅 ketchup with some Dijon mustard on the buns. I used just a single slice of Havarti cheese. 🧀 That way, you avoid all the processed junk that comes in fast food burgers and you know exactly what you're putting in your body. 👏

2. Sides! Skip the carb heavy/deep-fried fries or Mac n cheese and go with some sort of vegetables. I have a spinach and wild rocket salad 🥬 with carrots🥕 and a chopped up Red Envy apple. 🍎

3. Cooking method! Lots of fast food places drown their patties in artery-clogging grease. :( I sous vide mine to a lovely medium-rare (129°F for 45 mins) and finished it off with a 30 second sear on each side with just a spray of olive oil. It was still cooked perfectly; tender and super flavorful. And I only used salt and pepper for seasoning. 👌
