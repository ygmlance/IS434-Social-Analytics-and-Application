I haven’t had had mee soto for a long time and I was craving so badly for one.
.
Today, I finally bought the one from my neighborhood.
.
I have been eating the mee soto here since young and I thought it was the best ever.
.
Until one fine day when I tried the one from Haig Road which made me realized what a fool I’ve been!
.
Needless to say, this bowl didn’t satisfy me at all and the crave wasn’t satiated.
