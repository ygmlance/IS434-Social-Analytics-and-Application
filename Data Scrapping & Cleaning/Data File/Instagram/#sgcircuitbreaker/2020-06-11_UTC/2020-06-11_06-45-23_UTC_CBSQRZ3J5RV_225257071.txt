Like most Asian households, rice is most loved in our home. Love to keep experimenting with different types of rice specialties. Tried my hand at Prawns Biryani after very many years during the CB time. I always try to keep 1-2 portions of marinated prawns in the freezer; an easy fix to satisfy last minute cravings like these.
