Here’s the gorgeous trio, ready to be devoured. We call it the Father’s Day Panggang Box, and for good reason. 
The word ‘panggang' loosely translates to ‘roasted/grilled over an open flame’, and you can be sure that these babies are kissed with an ample supply of fiery love.

Ordering opens today, so if you’re looking to celebrate Father’s Day early…. Or if you’re just in for a kickass weekend, with a BBQ theme, here’s to recap what our Father’s Day Panggang box contains:

Ayam Panggang - a whole chicken marinated with spices and grilled to perfection with a kicap manis glaze.

Char Siu Melaka - a generous cut of pork belly slow cooked with our very own original gula Melaka marinate.

Naughty BBQ Ribs - a full slab of baby back ribs flame grilled with our signature rich and spicy ’naughty’ sauce.

Accompanied by - Coconut Glutinous Rice | Pineapple Salad | Burnt Chilli

All for $65nett with islandwide delivery included. This box is available from 12 June to 21 June. We will be taking last orders on 20 June at 12pm. These things tend to go fast, so book early to avoid disappointment !
