3 financial mistakes i made during my younger times. Because there is no one to advise me on that and YOLO too much. Hence it is still not too late to change your mistake if you can recognise it.

Too much online shopping ? Buying too many luxury products? 
You might want to take a step back and reflect on your finances. Before it is too late.
