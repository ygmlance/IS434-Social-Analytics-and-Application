I’m super proud of this top cuz I made it from scratch!!!! I don’t have a top that looks like this and I was looking at the plain white t-shirt scraps I had from cropping my other t-shirts and just had the idea strike me… sooo glad it turned out well and I can’t wait to wear this with everything once we get to go out again 💃🏻
