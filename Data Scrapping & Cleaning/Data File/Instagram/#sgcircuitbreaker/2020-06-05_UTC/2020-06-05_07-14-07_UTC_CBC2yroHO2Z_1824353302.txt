Compliments & cons of this stunning & spacious LV Onthego GM. The monogram reverse canvas is striking 😍 but the tote is hefty!!😥😅 This tote is not merely an accessory but a necessity to contain my lunchbox in thermal bag & for easy retrieval of phone (for scanning QR code) & access card each time I enter work premises. But rest assured that though it’s an open tote, a slim wallet can be kept securely in the large zip compartment. 👍😊 And being able to alternate between shoulder sling & handcarry in the crook of the arm definitely makes me tolerant of its weight 😬

So would you consider this tote to be a splurge or an essential? 😉
