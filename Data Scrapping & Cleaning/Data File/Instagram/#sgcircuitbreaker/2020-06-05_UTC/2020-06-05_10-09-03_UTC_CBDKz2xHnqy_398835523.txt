eco u would like to wish everyone a happy World Environment Day! It's crucial to understand the delicate balance of nature, and this year’s theme, biodiversity, underscores that. As we currently fight against the global pandemic, let’s pay extra attention to reversing biodiversity loss and playing a greater role in recuperating the environment. Hand in hand with the planet, we will overcome 💪🏼 #ecou #responsibleconvenience #worldenvironmentday2020
