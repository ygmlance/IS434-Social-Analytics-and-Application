[Throwback]‚Å£ We are so missing those days where we can visit museums and libraries! This is a throwback to the time we went to Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (which is one of my favorite museums because of the layout and the whole experience of the place!) as he has been obsessed with fossils and dinosaurs for quite awhile now, especially after engaging with HARDWORKING: Bravery Magazine Issue 9 which features MARY ANNING, the paleontologist. ‚Å£
‚Å£
One exhibit that intrigued him was the skeleton of the Singapore Sperm Whale. We read that it was found dead off Jurong Island in 2015. He was amazed at the full size of it and how intact the skeletons were. A1 identified that place like that of Mary Anning‚Äôs Fossil Depot.‚Å£
‚Å£
While looking at the exhibits, we spoke about how scientists are patient, curious and persistent to be able to find out about these animals, study them and become an expert.‚Å£
‚Å£
A1 was curious and excited about them, always asking questions about what are they, if they are real and how did they find them.‚Å£
‚Å£
Throughout the whole experience there, I asked him the following questions just to probe him to think while we go along : ‚Å£
üîπ What do you think are the skills that a scientist would need?‚Å£
üîπ What is one thing that you are curious about and would love to find out more of?‚Å£
üîπ Which is your favorite exhibit and why?‚Å£
üîπ What is one thing that you would like to contribute to the museum?‚Å£
üîπ If you were to explain about this place to your friend, what would you say?‚Å£
‚Å£
Have you been to Lee Kong Chian National History Museum? Do you love the place too? ‚ù§Ô∏è
