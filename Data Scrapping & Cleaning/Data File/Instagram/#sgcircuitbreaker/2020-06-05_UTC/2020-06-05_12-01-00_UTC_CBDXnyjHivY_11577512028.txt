Small acts when multiplied by millions of people, can indeed change the world! .
Today, June 5, is World Environment Day. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has contributed - one way or another, to a sustainable Singapore. These sustainability heroes in our community are doing their parts to improve the environment that we live in. Together, we celebrate the tireless efforts of many more unsung sustainability heroes out there!
.
Tough challenges are ahead, but don’t be afraid, because we’re in this together!
.
Over the coming weeks, the Sustainable Singapore Gallery will be hosting new ONLINE sustainability events - featuring unique upcycling workshops and other exciting sustainability activities that you can participate in from home! Follow the Sustainable Singapore Gallery on Facebook (fb.me/ssgallery.sg) and Instagram (@ssgallery.sg) to stay updated on our upcoming events!
