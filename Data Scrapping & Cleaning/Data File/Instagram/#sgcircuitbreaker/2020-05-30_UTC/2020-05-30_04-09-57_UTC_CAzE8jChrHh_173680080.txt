N E W L A U N C H !

Kyoaji Premium Bento : the sushi and sashimi are top quality, fresh ingredients. Good value for money for such top grade combination.

We also tried the Gyuniku Ebi Shitake Bento which has one of the best beef available in any bento , soft and juicy beef with the right amount of fat that simply meat in your mouth. The ebi paste is fused onto the shitake mushroom and deep fried tempura style. Quite an unique combination and very tasty.

There are several other selection of bento, you can select at https://www.facebook.com/KyoajiSG/
