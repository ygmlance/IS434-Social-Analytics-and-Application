Delicious Jap food we had the other day that satisfied our cravings during #sgcircuitbreaker

One Sushi @onesushisg is providing delivery and takeaway options! 15% off thejr menu as well as promotions for the Grilled Salmon Head ($13.80 for 2pcs) and Tako Yaki Ball ($3.80) Free delivery for Yishun, Punggol and Sengkang with orders of $30 and above. Also available on Grabfood (promotions not applicable on this platform)! Food were pretty fresh and we enjoyed them! Especially love the sashimi (been craving these since being stuck at home) and the Grilled Salmon Head! The One Sushi Chirashi Don is also a good choice to have a variety of sashimi on a bed of warm Japanese rice. Shiok!
