How a sunset saved my life with 5 words

When I was 21, I was breaking down over tremendous emotional stress. I was questioning my existence every single day. However, two years later, I had become a totally different person; one who couldn’t imagine ever wanting to leave this life.

How? I decided to do a simple thing – I watched the sun disappear into the horizon.

More often than not, we don’t give the sky enough credit. Sunset happens everyday. And we pass it by. We don’t stare in awe at this phenomenon and take in this spectacularly beautiful moment. I am guilty of that too, until I stopped that day, to luxuriate in this free painting that was being created in front of my eyes. From that moment on, I realized and appreciate the symbolism of the sunset – Just as there’s no such thing as an ugly sunset, there’s no such thing as an ugly life.

Tomorrow, the sun will rise again. You will get another 24 hours. That’s 1,440 minutes that have been untouched by yesterday. 1,440 minutes that have not been written yet. 1,440 minutes to make into your own – 1,440 minutes that are there for the taking. It’s time to create, to work, to set a new goal, to climb a new hurdle. It’s time to share with your loved ones, it’s time to dig deeper into your own soul. It’s time that you will never get back - it’s a gift to be treasured.

Tomorrow, the sun will set again. Enjoy the beauty again. Enjoy the soft glow, the sense of peace, the feeling of stillness that touches everyone and everywhere – no matter who, or where you are. The dark isn’t scary. Let the night wash over you and lay down to rest with the satisfaction of a day well lived. Look forward to whatever tomorrow will bring.

It’s been 2 years - I have learnt to treasure and embrace every mistake for its lessons and opportunities. I am grateful for the mistakes I made, for they are what made me who I am today.

So which 5 words? There is beauty in tomorrow.
