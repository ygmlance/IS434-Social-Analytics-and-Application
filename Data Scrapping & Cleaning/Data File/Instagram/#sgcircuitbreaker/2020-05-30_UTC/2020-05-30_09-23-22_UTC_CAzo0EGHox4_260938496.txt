A little happiness amidst having to stay home...!!! We celebrated helperâ€™s birthday last night with @pizzahut_sg and a strawberry chocolate pudding cake from @chateraise.singapore

Totally feel that it must be tough on helper to be away from family and unable to go out to meet with friends during this time... Hope we were able to make her feel a little better... ðŸ˜Š

Quinton is always so happy to be part of any birthday celebration and Kyleigh is just super confused with whatâ€™s going on. ðŸ˜‚
