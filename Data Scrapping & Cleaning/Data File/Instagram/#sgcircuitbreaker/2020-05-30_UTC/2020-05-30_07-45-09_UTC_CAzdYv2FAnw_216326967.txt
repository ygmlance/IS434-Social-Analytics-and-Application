Now that there's some light at the end of the CB tunnel, here's another reunion jam with my old band, The Lilac Saints — likely our last collab for a while.
⠀
Great fun jamming with my bros @gogomonster (vocals, also part of local mandopop group Dreamz FM 梦‧飞船 ), @youjinoui (bass) & @lilacsaintdrums (cajon drum/shaker). Missing Bhaskar, wherever you are.

This song’ Gina’ was our first local hit back in 1995 (yes, we’re old) on the @987fm charts. We recorded it with a lo-fi four-track machine onto demo cassette tapes — crackly sound quality included — and passed those around to local radio DJs. How indie. I’m still amazed how we managed to get any airplay with that recording LOL. 'Gina', incidentally, is short for 'imagination'. What we all need a bit more of to get through this crazy time.
