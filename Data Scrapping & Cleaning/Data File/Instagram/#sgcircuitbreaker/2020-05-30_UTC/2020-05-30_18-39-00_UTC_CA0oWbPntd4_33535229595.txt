Drama: KHLOE EP 1 üì∫ @mewatch.mediacorp
‚û°Ô∏è I can't believe I binged watch ALL 10 EPISODES on meWATCH in 1 day üòÇ This series is a lot more different than I thought it would be. It is narrated alot by the female lead, Hanli Hoefer, where she gives her perspective on everything she sees/hears/does. It's really interesting because it goes to the heart of how dangerous social media can be (e.g. being fake on social media, how social media can hurt others and victims of sexual scandals).

Khloe Wong (Hanli Hoefer), a charismatic, but ruthless influencer, engineers a social media scandal to nab a starring role in acclaimed local director Bob Chandra's (Ebi Shankara) highly-anticipated comeback movie.
