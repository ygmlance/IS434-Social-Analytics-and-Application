Itâ€™s been awhile of staying home and finally weâ€™re towards the end of CB soon, so what had I discovered during this period?
The girls spent so much time cutting, tracing and pasting papers and I realised they have hidden talent in making their own masks, scrape book, storybook to share amongst themselves etc! They are able to dance quite well now and best of all to self-improvised on games to suit indoor play! ðŸ’¯ .
