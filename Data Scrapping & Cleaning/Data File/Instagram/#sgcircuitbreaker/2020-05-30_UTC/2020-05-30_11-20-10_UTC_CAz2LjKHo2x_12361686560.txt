I saw the news for Starker and I am so sad. Really one of the places that I enjoy hanging out with my friends. Lots of laughter and memories and can I say, I love their live band too.

Really unfortunate that this Covid-19 caused so much disruption for many businesses. But I do hope that once the situation eases, we will see more positive news that brings us better hope for the economy! 💪🏼
