CHASHU DON
Get in my belly!! 30mins of prep, pop them in the fridge overnight and they are ready to be served the next day! ✻
Ingredients:
•Pork belly (remove rind), cut into half or quarters depending on how much you bought
•1 cup soy sauce
•1 cup sake
•3/4 cup sugar
•2 cups of water
•1/2 a ginger, sliced
•3 leeks, sliced
✻
Method:
•In a frying pan, sear pork belly until all sides are golden brown
•Pour all ingredients (except pork) into a pot and bring them to a boil. Remember to stir and melt the sugar
•Place pork belly in (make sure it is fully covered by the seasoning). Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 2-3 hours until soft. Once done, refrigerate overnight
PS: I also made 6.5min eggs (tough with an induction stove) and soaked it together with the pork belly. If you do this make sure the sauce is completely cooled before you put your eggs in!
