My little rascal turns 2 today! Every day our love-hate relationship just keeps getting stronger. However, I know my boy today, will never gonna be the same boy tomorrow. And there is gonna come a day, he is not gonna run to me and ask me for 抱抱, or ask me, “daddy 吃什么?” or hold my hands with his tiny fingers. I know there are so many of these small moments that I'll yearn for just one more day of them.
So more now, I will make sure I treasure every little ones of them and be cheeky, be brave for the world. Happy Birthday, my darling boy 🎂
