Kefir (/kÉ™ËˆfÉªÉ™r/ kÉ™-FEER)

A fermented milk beverage, similar to yoghurtâ€¦ except it is not, itâ€™s even better!

The result is a rich, creamy and tangy beverage, packed with Probiotics, Protein, B Vitamins, and Calcium to maintain healthy bodily function. Fermented only with Organic Whole Milk, a serving of Kefir boasts an abundant of nutritional benefits.

We love both our Kefir and Kombucha, our go-to beverage fix, rich in healthful microbes. However, Kefir is a richer source of lactic acid bacteria which makes it more of a drinkable probiotic supplement, and Kombucha, more of a digestive aid! âœ¨ðŸ¥›
