.
☘️RASMISA Rajma/Kidney beans (Rajma cooked in very little oil in tomato gravy with Spices. Check my IG stories ) ☘️Jasmine Rice .
☘️ Crispy Pepper Tofu (Panfried) 🥒 Cucumber Kimchi (Slice Cucumber into half moon shape, Add salt, sugar and red chilli powder as per your taste and add a tsp of sesame oil , mix well and sprinkle toasted white sesame seeds and serve immediately. )
.🍹 Chilled 🥭 Aamras /Mango shake with Pecans. (I use Bangapalli Mangoes here , blend with Ice and add tsp of Maple Syrup as Mangoes 🥭 were already very sweet) Topped with Pecans.😋
