"Listen to me, we're going on a trip now, it's going to be rough. If you hear something in the woods, you tell me. if you hear something in the water, you tell me. But under no circumstances are you allowed to take off your blindfold." - Me forcing the girls to have their longgggg overdue afternoon nap. #birdbox #sgcircuitbreaker
