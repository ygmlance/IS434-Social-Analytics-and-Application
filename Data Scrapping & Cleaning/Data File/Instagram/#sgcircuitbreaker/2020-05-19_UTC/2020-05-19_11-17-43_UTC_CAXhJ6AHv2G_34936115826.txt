1-week “No Oil, No Salt, No Sauce Meal Challenge” begins!
Day 1
Breakfast: 2 hard-boiled eggs.
Lunch: 2 boiled drumsticks, boiled brocolli and potatoes with black pepper.
Dinner: Boiled minced pork collar, pumpkin, enoki mushrooms, airfried shitake mushrooms and scallops.
Already can feel the difference as compared to eating usual meals. Not as thirsty and lethargic post-meal💪🏼
Looking forward to Day 2😎 #healthyfood #healthylifestyle #nooilcooking #fitness #nutrition #cleaneating #health #food #eatinghealthy #deliciousandnutritious #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker
