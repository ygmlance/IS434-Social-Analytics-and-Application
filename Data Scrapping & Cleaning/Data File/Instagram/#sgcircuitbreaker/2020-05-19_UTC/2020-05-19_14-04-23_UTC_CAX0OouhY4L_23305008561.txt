19/31 - Ramjet Sneeze
Prompt: Write about a time you experienced something that may be a common human event.
Reaction: COVID brought to light on the devastating capacity our sneeze have. From the huge inhaling of air pre sneeze and releasing that shot of air & water droplet mixture, it almost feels like the way a ramjet works. .
For #circuitbreakermay, i've decided to take on an experiment in abstract imagery using the prompts from #theisolationjournals , to inspire me from their writing. During the #ecbm (extended circuit breaker measures) that will be in place in #singapore for the month of may.
