😻SHERMS COOKS: SOUS VIDE SALMON WITH FRUIT SALAD
-
Protein➡️Look at that ridiculously beautiful slab of salmon. I cooked this one at 125°F for 45 mins, which results in a tender, super flaky but not overly raw piece of fish (which was an issue for me cooking at lower temps). I have a drizzle of BBQ sauce for a smoky sweet flavor to balance out the richness of the fatty fish.

Veggies➡️Some snow peas steamed in the microwave. I also have a delicious fruit salad of pear🍐, apple🍎 and strawberry🍓.

Carbs➡️A walnut roll from @bakerandcooksg. Recently I've been really liking nuts and fruits in my bread, and this one is really good! Crackling crust on the outside yet soft and fluffy in the middle. I cut it in half and spread some vanilla Bordier butter on it. The walnuts really add a super delicious earthiness which is contrasted by the sweetness of the butter. 😋
