An iconic Singaporean dessert. A favorite of both the youthful and elderly, one might be surprised to find out that it was only recently created in 1984 on our shores. Inspired by local ingredients, a chef from Hong Kong created the dessert to provide a rich and delectable experience for his customers.

Three and a half decades later, we are proud to carry on this journey of innovation, creating Mango Sago with Kefir. Fruity and creamy, our kefir coats your mouth with the unctuous flavor of mango.

Made to order, our Mango Sago Kefir contains 100% of all the benefits of Kefir, with the natural flavor and fragrance of specially sourced Premium Mangoes. 
Best consumed on its own, without ice. Ceramic bowl and spoon optional (though it tastes better in our opinion) ðŸ¥­
