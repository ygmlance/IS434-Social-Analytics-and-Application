J for Jellybean üç° the kids have been snacking alot during the CB period, and what better way to squeeze in some simple exercise while munching on these Jellybeans!

Sarah learnt about the Jellybeans that grew in pods in Giants' land.. and she laid out the jellybeans in J and identified the letter amidst the other alphabets. .

I am so glad the kids are returning to school soon , the real work from home begins. For the past 2 months is just being a jack of all trades ü§≠ trying to come up with some sort of activity to occupy them in between concalls and spreadsheets. .
