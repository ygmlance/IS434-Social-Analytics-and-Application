How ready? ðŸ¤”

The inconvenience of the Covid-19 Circuit Breaker period has been really trying on most aspects of everyone's life. As much as we dislike it, this period has also given us an opportunity to do a lot of soul searching and reflecting on what we want to better and what we do not want to take for granted again.

We all look forward to the end of CB. Yet, are you ready for this opportune period for self-improvement to really end?

Is there a new responsibility you want to take seriously? Have you achieved something permanently positive of yourself? What's new?

Are you excited to step out of CB because you've done all you possibly can indoors to better yourself? Or are you still hazed in sleepiness and negativity of being home most times?

Have you managed to take advantage of this period in a way you're confident you're going to make a good kind of difference in at least 1 aspect of your life post-CB?

Or simply, if you think what you've done is enough then truly, it is enough.

If not, it's still not too late.

As for myself, I know I'm not ready, yet.
(Liddat CB can extend or not, huh? ðŸ¤ª)
