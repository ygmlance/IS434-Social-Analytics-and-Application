I'm a Running Man fan and loved their 9th anniversary concert finale performance, part of which was a choreo to this song. The song stuck since then, and I've always been thinking it'd be great if I could dance to this song someday 🙃 But I didn't (and still don't) think I can pull off the genres of dance that can go w this song well 😹🤦🏻‍♀️ Imagine my excitement finding out the song choice and how the choreo looked like 🤩🤩 Hopefully I did this cool choreo some justice! Sorry for the awkward movements at some points 😹 🎧: Boom by Tiesto & Sevenn
