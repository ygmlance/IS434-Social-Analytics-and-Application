It all started 3 years ago when I had to quit my full time job being a Montessori Directress as I gave birth to my lovely boy. While being a full-time mom, I decided to venture into baking! I made my son's first birthday cake with dessert table items and it all had to be Gluten-free as he had digesting issues as an infant. With the lovely support of my family and a pool of followers, I decided to start selling them. 
The Sweet Room by Arveen (@thesweetroombyarveen) has only been baking Gluten-free items ever since! Of course not all businesses can have a straight path of pure success. This circuit breaker did affect mine quite abit as many couldn't order their bakes from me due to the closing of all home based businesses that happened for about 2 weeks. I'm glad that it's picking up now and I can't thank all my supporters enough. 
If you wish to order some delicious Gluten-free bakes of mine, please do so 3 weeks in advance or enquire by clicking on this page ðŸ‘‰ @thesweetroombyarveen
