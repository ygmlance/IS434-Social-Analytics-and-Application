        "text": "I think this chart could be a little more specific in who the recipient of protection is. With surgical mask, for example, several health organizations informed that these don\u2019t largely protect the wearer, but instead filter out respiratory secretions of the wearer to prevent those around them from being infected (with 95% viral protection for others). Also research has been done on cloth mask efficacy (again protecting others). Way lower protection, and it varies on the make, but it can protect others at a lower percentage than surgical masks in much the same way. This efficacy can be improved by adding a nylon stocking layer according to researchers at Northeastern University. There is other research on cloth mask efficacy (adding extra layers, type of fabric, etc). The best case scenario is that both parties are wearing masks with viral protection or wearing a masks like the n95 (but in the US, these are mainly reserved for healthcare workers). But research keeps progressing on the subject, so understanding may change as well.",
