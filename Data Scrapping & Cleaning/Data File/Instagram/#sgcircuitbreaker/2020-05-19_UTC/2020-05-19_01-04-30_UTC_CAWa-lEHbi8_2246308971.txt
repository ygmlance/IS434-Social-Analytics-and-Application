#NothingMakesUsHappier than sharing our #SgCircuitBreaker #TimeCapsule with you!

As we start counting down to the end of our #CircuitBreaker, we would like to take a few moments to look back at what we will remember as one of the greatest disruptions to our lives. Working together with sister companies, Barking Dogs Design and GO! Events, we are happy to present out latest creation - My Circuit Breaker Time Capsule Booklet - printed on such nice luxurious paper that youâ€™ve got to have a copy! ðŸ˜‰ 
Join us in capturing these moments and creating a forever memory! Let's journal the hopes, fears, ups and downs we had during these challenging times before we start to dream again for a new future in a New Normal!

Comment below if you would like a free copy and we will send to you by mail or arrange for a pick up.

If you are an existing @BarkingDogs.sg @PrintDynamics.sg or @GoEvents.sg customer, please contact your sales person to reserve your priority copy! .
