Circuit Breaker Part 2. Day 1 vs Day 7 vs Day 14.
.
Been engaging in #chloetingchallenge and Hannah's @moving_mango Pilates. How will I look on Day 28? 🤔 Feels like Day 7 and Day 14 not much difference, although I can feel the strength difference when I workout. Definitely arm strength and core strength is getting stronger.

Circuit breaker is coming to an end soon, but we'll move into the next phase of a new lifestyle. Wonder when will we be able to head back to the gym. 🏋️‍♀️
