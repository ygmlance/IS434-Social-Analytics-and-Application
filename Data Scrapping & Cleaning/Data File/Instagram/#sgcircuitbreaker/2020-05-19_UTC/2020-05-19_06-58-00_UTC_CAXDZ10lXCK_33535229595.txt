Drama: KIN EP 396 ⚠️ 18 May 2020
‼️Ah Hock is too distracted impressing Emily Shelley by working on a big project with Kwan Shelley United Holdings (KSUH) and promising to deliver an A-🌟 result 💫, putting his company and partnership with Rickson at risk!! 🤑 Anyone should know by now that it is not the money that will impress Emily but the quality time (which James lack on giving her). 😢 Don't do this to yourself Ah Hock 😔

Plot:
About the complexities of life, love and family relationships, and office politics. Years have passed since Yoke and Ella had their lives turned upside-down when they returned to be with their rightful families after having been swapped at birth. Years later, Yoke has seemingly embraced her role as a status-conscious, high society Shelley, assuming a leadership role in the family business. Ella has accepted her fate as a member of the salt of the earth, working-class Loh family but struggles to make something of her life. The Lohs, Shelleys, Hassans, and Balas have overcome personal loss, incarceration, as well as estrangement of their loved ones; yet lingering tensions remain. (@mewatch.mediacorp)
