BE KIND- Let's choose to be kind to OURSELVES and give ourselves (as parents), some grace. ‚Å£
‚Å£
From yesterday's post about the book No Drama Discipline, we received so many direct messages asking about some tips from the book, and many others commenting that they need to read the book NOW because during this circuit breaker, they are seeing themselves losing their patience more often and having to be mediators in sibling squabbles once every hour, on top of having to manage work (be it in zoom meetings/answer calls/reply to emails), put food on the table and have the whole family's laundry washed/dried/somewhat folded.‚Å£
‚Å£
We FEEL you and UNDERSTAND you. ‚Å£
‚Å£
We don't have it together in our home all the time too. I have had to diffuse squabbles between the boys often, sit them down, look at them at eye level (three times today, I counted) to talk about fair play, unkind words said and manage a temper tantrum.‚Å£
‚Å£
But each time where I have to do that, I reframe my mind to see it as an opportunity instead to engage them in meaningful conversation by‚Å£
‚ù§Ô∏è first connecting with them‚Å£
‚ù§Ô∏è naming the emotion‚Å£
‚ù§Ô∏è the reason for the need to talk‚Å£
‚Å£
Is it hard? YOU BET! But I want to keep trying (though I may fail at times) to be better at this, for our children üòå‚Å£
‚Å£
Let's encourage each other on this journey üí™ and BE KIND to ourselves even when we fail ‚ù§Ô∏è.
