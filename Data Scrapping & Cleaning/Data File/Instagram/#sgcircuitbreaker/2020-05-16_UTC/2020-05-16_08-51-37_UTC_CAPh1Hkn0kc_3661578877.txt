An original song, “Together, We Will Survive” composed by Shirley Ho in April to sing my Covid-19 blues away and a reminder of the tough time that we went through #stnetschallenge #sgunited #sgunited🇸🇬 #stayhomeforsg#sgsingtogether#sgmusic#singersongwriters#singtogethersg#sgunited#sgcircuitbreaker#quarantinesongs#socialdistancing#straitstimes#nets_sg#tiktoksg#stayhomesafe#coronavirus#sgmusician#covid19sg #dearcovid19sg @nets_sg  @straits_times Song Title: Together, We will Survive
The siren’s ringing
My heart is racing 
We need solutions 
To all the bad situations 
We need to know how 
The best way to live 
Is to care and try 
That’s how we will survive whoa 
For you've got to know 
We are in this together 
You've got to know 
With hope, we will, survive 
Together, we will survive
