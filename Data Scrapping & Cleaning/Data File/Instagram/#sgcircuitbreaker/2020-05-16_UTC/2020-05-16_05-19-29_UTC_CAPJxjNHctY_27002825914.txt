😻SHERMS COOKS: HEALTHY FRUITY BRUNCH PLATE (swipe to see everything on my plate this afternoon!)
-
Fun fact: I love 🍞 so much, when the CB measures were tightened I was so worried they would include bread as part of the restrictions. My fave place to order bread at the moment is @sistersfield. Their soft bagels and sourdough are so good. 👏 I also love soft fluffy breads and buns like shokupan and steamed bread from Ya Kun kaya toast. I usually have my bread with some super good quality butter or cheese.

Protein➡️2 sunny @nuyolksg eggs (I screwed up the first one so it's hiding underneath the more perfect second one 😅) and a pile of my favorite smoked salmon.
-
Carbs➡️Plain bagel from @before_annd_after. I have vanilla butter on one half and strawberry jam on the other. I love how the bagels are just the perfect size, I don't trust myself to portion carbs when I'm hungry cause I always end up with TOO much. 😅
-
Veggies➡️A fruit salad of watermelon and blueberries. Okay these watermelon sticks were leftover from one of the patients at the hospital, he/she didn't even open the watermelon box so I quickly nabbed it and chucked it into fridge haha.
