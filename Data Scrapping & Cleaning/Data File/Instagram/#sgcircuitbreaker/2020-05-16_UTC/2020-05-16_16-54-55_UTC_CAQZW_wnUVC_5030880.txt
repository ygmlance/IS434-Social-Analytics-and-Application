Just before the Circuit breaker starts, I ran through my first aid box to ensure all the basic medications are well stocked , just in case I need to address to some common ailments at home should that happens !

Circuit breaker seems to be a good period to clean up the house but not when your nose suffers from the dust allergies whilst doing that ðŸ˜·

I am glad to be able to find #Clarityn at the major pharmacy near my house, Clarityn tablets is my usual top choice because :

1. No.1 OTC ( off the counter ) allergy brand in the world for more than 10 years !

2. Its non drowsy ! Meaning it wonâ€™t affect my work productivity when I am working from home should i suffer from any allergies / flu / sinus. Providing 24 hours of fast reliefs ðŸ¥³

3. Clarityn Tablets is able to relief more than 200 indoor and outdoor allergens. Eg : dust mites / pollen allergies / food allergies !

Clarityn tablets is mini-sized ( Swipe left to see ) , making it easy for everyone to swallow & guess what ! It has no interactions even if u take with your fav food juices ðŸ’›

Clarityn is available at all major pharmacy, its always good to have a ready box back at home for unforeseen circumstances ðŸ™‚ Be well prepared , stay safe in the meantime ðŸ¥°
