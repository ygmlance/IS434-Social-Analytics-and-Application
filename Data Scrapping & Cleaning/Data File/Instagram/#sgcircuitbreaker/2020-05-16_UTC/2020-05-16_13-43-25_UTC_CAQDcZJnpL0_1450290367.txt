CB Day 40...
What’s better to keep them entertained with some of the leftover (or rather “rejected”) cookies to design with! 
They still had fun colouring (and eating) them even though the cookies are “handicapped” 🤣🤣🤣 Thank you @skyhui18 for baking the delicious cookies and of cos @jackteo888 for helping to deliver all the cookies kits out today. Sounds like a Santa Claus 🎅 job! 🥰
