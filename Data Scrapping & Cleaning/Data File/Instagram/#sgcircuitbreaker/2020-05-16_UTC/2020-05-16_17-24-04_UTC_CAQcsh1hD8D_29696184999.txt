Singapore sits at the crossroads of Asia, and now the world. Our kombucha was created to reflect that diversity and heritage, right at our doorsteps. We aimed to use ingredients that were not only familiar, but that would invoke memories when consumed.

That crisp and delightful Teh-O Ping after a hard jog at your local park

A refreshingly tart beverage after a heavy supper at your neighbourhood prata house

Or even Momâ€™s special chrysanthemum tea for when the days got really warm

Weâ€™ve all had some form of these memories, and if you havenâ€™t, all the more weâ€™d love to have you join us. Weâ€™re only just beginning, stay tuned and you might just discover a thing or two about yourself at the bottom of a bottle.
