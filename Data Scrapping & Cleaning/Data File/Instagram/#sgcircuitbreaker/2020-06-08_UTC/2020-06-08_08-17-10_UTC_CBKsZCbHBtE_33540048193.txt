盐酥鸡 Salted Crispy Chicken
1️⃣ marinate chicken thigh pieces with a mixture of fermented beancurd, soy sauce and five spice powder for at least four hours (best overnight) 
2️⃣ stir in an egg white before coating with sweet potato flour
3️⃣ deep fry them twice (first in hot oil at medium heat to cook the meat, and a second time with the oil at high heat turned down to a medium to make it crispy on the outside).
.
⚠️Warning: Only do this if you're prepared to deal with oil splattering everywhere, including onto your hands and the stove top, and of course, a very oily kitchen floor. Having said that, the outcome was well worth it. But I wouldn't be doing this too often!
