We all have to start▶️ somewhere.
.
I started 2 years ago, low⬇️ confidence, scared😖 of public speaking. The reason why I decided to become an instructor🚴‍♀️ was to overcome performance anxiety.
.
I took baby👼 steps, pushed myself, and came in consistently.
.
I had to give myself credit💯 for how far I have come and my hard work translated into noticeable improvement on myself.
.
⚠️So, don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. If I can do it, you can too 🤩
