This #sgcircuitbreaker , i got alot of chance to cook the dishes that I have nv try b4 & #lasagna is one of them !

When i told hub i wanna make lasagna, his response was : siaooooo, so much work ! 
Honestly, i kinda enjoy the momentum of laying the layers ðŸ¤£

Spread the home made meat sauce, sprinkle the cheese, layer the lasagna sheets and spread the bechamel sauce. And you repeat it !

Another dish that was a hit with Kyan, he gave thumbs up for this ! M so glad I tried making this because the lasagna i get outside is always MEHHH ~
