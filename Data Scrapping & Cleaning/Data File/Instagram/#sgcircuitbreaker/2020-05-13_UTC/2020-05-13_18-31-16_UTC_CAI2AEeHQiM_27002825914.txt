🍕ALT PIZZA: THE PRAWNSTER
-
I got intro-ed to @altpizza a few months ago by a friend of mine, and this is my first time visiting their Robertson Quay outlet. They have 20% off all takeaways this circuit breaker period yay! 💫 This 11 inch, very filling pizza cost me $15, which is indeed quite affordable~

Their sourdough pizzas are hand-stretched upon order and it just tastes so lovely and crispy. The Prawnster comes on a tomato sauce base with garlic sautéed prawn, cheese, fresh basil and some roasted bell pepper (originally spinach but I had it changed). The prawns are so sweet and crunchy and contrast against the tanginess of the tomato sauce.

I ate this delightful pie by the Singapore River, watching the crowds go by. And then I got myself a Gianduia gelato from @trattorialuccas, and the night ended well. 😊
