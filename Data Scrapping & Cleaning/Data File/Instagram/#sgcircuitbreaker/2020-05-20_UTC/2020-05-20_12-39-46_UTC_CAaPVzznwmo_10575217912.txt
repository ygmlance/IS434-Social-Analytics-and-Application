CAULIFLOWER PIZZA
In case you missed this on my story, this is one low carb/calories pizza. Also makes me feel better eating half a pizza! Choice of ingredients completely up to you.

Ingredients:
• One head of cauliflower florets, chopped (or you can buy cauliflower rice but it’s more expensive)
• Salt and pepper
• Garlic powder
• Cheese
• 1 egg, beaten
• Tomato paste/Prego sauce
✻

Method:
•Steam or microwave cauliflower florets till softened
•In a blender or food processor, blend the cauliflower florets until it looks like rice
•Using a cloth bag, drain all the water out of the cauliflower rice. If you don’t have one use paper towels!
•Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder. Add in one beaten egg and a handful of cheese
•Form your pizza base on a parchment paper and bake for 20 mins at 200deg to get that nice crunch
•Once done, remove from oven and spread tomato paste and toppings. Further bake for 10 mins or until golden brown
PS: I tried baking the crust and toppings for 30 mins but the crust didn’t turn out as crispy!
