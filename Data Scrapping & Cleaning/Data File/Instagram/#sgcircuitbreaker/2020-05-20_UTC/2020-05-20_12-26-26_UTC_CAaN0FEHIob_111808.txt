We’ve had a number of insanely pretty sunsets since the lockdown started - an upside amidst the storm that is the pandemic. It’s like as if nature is putting on a show for all of us stuck in our homes, reminding us to slow down and watch the beauty outside. And indeed it is perfectly okay for us to slow down.
We’re in a pandemic. We’re all going through collective trauma right now regardless of where we are in the world. We’re humans with emotions, fears, insecurities and right now, our basic sense of security is being threatened with food shortages, disrupted healthcare and the perpetual threat of infection. It’s an existential crisis in the most literal sense. Don’t beat yourself up if you can’t focus, if you can’t get things done, if you’re not productive. That’s the last thing to worry about right now. Instead, take care of your health - both physical and mental.
For my fellow friends going through a hard time this pandemic, this post is for you. Unfortunately, this episode has also successfully brought my depression back, and I am also learning that it’s okay not to be okay. And at least, there’s the occasional pretty sunset to look forward to.
