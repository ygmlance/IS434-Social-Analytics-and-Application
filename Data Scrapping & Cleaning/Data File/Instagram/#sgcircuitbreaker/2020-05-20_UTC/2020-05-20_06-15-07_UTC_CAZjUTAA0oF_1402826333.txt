Sharing our love for lavender. This is a special range with Urtekram as it is enhanced with active probiotics ( lactobacilllius ferment)  to balance your skin’s pH and moisture level. Have you tried probiotics in your beauty regime?
Recently read up on the skin microbiome’s (check out Dr. Whitney Bowe’s book) and the research on probiotics has made a lot of progress in the last decade, showing a symbiotic relationship between certain strains of probiotics and healthy skin, where the right combination is excellent for fighting inflammation such as  acne and chronic skin conditions,Eg, eczema, dryness, rosacea. ⁣
