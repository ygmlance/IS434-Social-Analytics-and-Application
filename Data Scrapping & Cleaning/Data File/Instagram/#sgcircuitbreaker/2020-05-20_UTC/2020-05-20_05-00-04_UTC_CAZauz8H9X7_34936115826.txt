How much should I eat per day? 
Well that really depends on your goal. However, there are a few things that you should be aware of if you’re looking to start planning your daily food intake effectively in order to achieve your physical goals:

1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) & Maintenance Calories Per Day

2. Macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats) Distribution
The acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges (AMDR) are 45–65% of your daily calories from carbs, 20–35% from fats and 10–35% from protein. To lose weight, find a ratio you can stick with, focus on healthy foods and eat fewer calories than you burn.

3. Once you have established your Macronutrient Distribution (MD), it’s important to plan what your meals are made up of so that you fulfil your planned MD. Use apps like MyFitnessPal to estimate the macronutrients of foods you consume.

4. Spread out your meals evenly throughout the day to prevent blood sugar levels from spiking which will affect your body’s metabolism

5. Do not consume less than 1,200 calories (for women); 1,500 calories (for men) daily

6. Plan your calorie intake in comparison with your Maintenance Calories Per Day so that you result in a deficit (lose fat)/ balance (maintain body weight)/ surplus (gain fat), depending on your goal

Hope this helps in your fitness journey!😊💪🏼
