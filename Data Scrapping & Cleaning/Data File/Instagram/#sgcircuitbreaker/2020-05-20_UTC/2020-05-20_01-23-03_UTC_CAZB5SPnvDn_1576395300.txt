⁣Have you tried our Chicken Street Satays? This new menu addition lets you enjoy our crowd favourite jumbo-sized Chicken Satays in iconic street satay style! It's also made to the same delicious recipe, which @thehungrybunnie loved when she tried our jumbo-sized Chicken Satays. "The Chicken Satay was absolutely smashing, juicy, flavourful, and wonderfully smoky. I went through 2 sticks before I realised I'd clean forgotten about the peanut sauce, which was amazing on its own. Blended with grated pineapple for added oomph, its piquant spicy-sweet contrast enlivened the fresh cucumber, red onions, and soft steamed rice cakes." — @thehungrybunnie. Chicken Street Satay is exclusively available from Violet Oon Satay Bar & Grill. Swipe for more à la carte options. ⁣⠀ ⠀ ⠀
