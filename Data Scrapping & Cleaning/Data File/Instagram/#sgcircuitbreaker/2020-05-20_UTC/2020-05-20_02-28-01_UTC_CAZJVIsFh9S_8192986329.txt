Ragda Pattice..
Being Maharashtrian am a great fan of Mumbai street food .. I have very beautiful memories with chaat & my friends. Having chaat with friends specially when its raining😍..that was the best time of my life. We spent hours & hours after college not with coffee but having chaat ... may be it's a stall or a restaurant ... and now my son is a fan of chaat too.. inherited the same genes .. and I love to prepare chaat for him & for  me too..
So this is our midweek indulgence..
🏵For patties I used oats flour as a binder instead of bread crumbs & they turned out amazing in texture. Crisp exterior & soft interior....
💮recipe is in stories/highlights...
Do you have such precious memories of food with friends.. would love to know in comments😍...
