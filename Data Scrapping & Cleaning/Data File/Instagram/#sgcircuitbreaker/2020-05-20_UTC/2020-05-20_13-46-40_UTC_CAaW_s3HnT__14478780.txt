No. 18/52 Inktober 52

The new #inktober52 challenge with weekly prompts throughout the year. 
The prompt of last week was “praying mantis”. “Can you find the praying mantis amongst the ferns in the Botanical Gardens, Singapore?” I seriously thought I couldn’t pull off this prompt and had wanted to give up. Glad I persisted.
