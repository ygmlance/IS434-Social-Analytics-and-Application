➡️ This scene made me tear so much even though there wasn't a lot of dialogue to it. The way Ananya looked at Nina was as though she was looking at Deanna and just missing her best friend. The hug was so touching and I could tell that Ananya really just wants Nina to open up to her more 😢😭 Nina has a wall built around her and sometimes it's hard to just accept the changes around her. Nina was shocked to receive Ananya's hug but I know deep down she really felt the warmth and know that Ananya truly cares for her 🤗❤️

Plot:
About the complexities of life, love and family relationships, and office politics. Years have passed since Yoke and Ella had their lives turned upside-down when they returned to be with their rightful families after having been swapped at birth. Years later, Yoke has seemingly embraced her role as a status-conscious, high society Shelley, assuming a leadership role in the family business. Ella has accepted her fate as a member of the salt of the earth, working-class Loh family but struggles to make something of her life. The Lohs, Shelleys, Hassans, and Balas have overcome personal loss, incarceration, as well as estrangement of their loved ones; yet lingering tensions remain. (@mewatch.mediacorp)
