Taking a moment to dream about a better tomorrow that is yet to come ðŸ’«
.
Avyanna is happy to join hands with @mercurysocial , @jessicacindy_official and @voiceswellness to help raise funds for those who are most affected by the virus.
.
Eight generous and gorgeous women have opened up their homes and hearts to us to show how they continue to display resilience and grace during these harsh times through the lens of their own smartphones and without any external assistance.
.
From now until the end of June, Avyanna will pledge $120 from every piece of jewellery sold to the Singapore Childrenâ€™s Society @sgchildrensoc . Our funds will go directly towards providing meals, counselling and mental health resources to children, youth and families in need.
.
Now, letâ€™s help each other, uplift those who need help, and never lose sight of our dreams.
