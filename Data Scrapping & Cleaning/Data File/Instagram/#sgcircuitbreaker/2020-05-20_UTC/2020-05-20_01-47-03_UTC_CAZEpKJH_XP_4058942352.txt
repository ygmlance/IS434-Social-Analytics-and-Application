There may be some good news!! 👍

I know alot of you have been contacting me and wants to know if we are reopening as part of the phase 1. It looks like that's very likely, we just need to get MOH's final confirmation.
We also need to make the neccesary arrangements on our part to make sure we can abide by the guidelines given out by the authorities, to make sure everyone stays safe when visiting our clinic from the 2nd June onwards.

We will be contacting all of you very soon. Can't wait to see all the patients again. ✌️ #sgchiropractor #sgcircuitbreaker
