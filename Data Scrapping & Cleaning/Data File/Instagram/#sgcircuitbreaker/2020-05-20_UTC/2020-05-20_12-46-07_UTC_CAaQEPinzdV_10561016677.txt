These are unprecedented times as the COVID-19 situation continues to unfold. There is a plethora of negative emotions and anxiety. Yet, it is in our national psyche to adapt and grow.

The science of resilience can offer us skills to resurface our innate ability to adapt and grow.

In partnership with @nycsg , we are launching four interactive webinars to explore the science of resilience. This series, while addressing our fears and anxiety, is also about harnessing our innate ability to thrive.
