A busy sunday doing all the preparations. Since it is CB period, can only do a mini home birthday celebration for William.

Xandria enjoys doing the sponge cake, and this time the cake turns out better than the previous (Thanks to the handmixer!) She even help me to wash the rice üòò. Cooked the Claypot Chicken with Abalone (È≤çÈ±ºÈ∏°ÁÖ≤)ÔºåFried Seafood and Bamboo Pith soup with sharkfins to celebrate William's birthday.

Thanks to all the family members to do the Zoom cake-cutting together. Deeply appreciate all for making time to celebrate together.
