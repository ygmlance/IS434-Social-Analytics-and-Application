2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣0️⃣ Not a new decade I have envisioned it to be. Experienced a pandemic situation that has changed our lifestyle and learnt to adapt to the new normal. Thanks to technology, I could still see my parents over a device. Been working from home since 16 Mar, before Singapore circuit breaker kicked in on 7 Apr and extended till 2 June. Regardless of the old or the #newnormal .. keep calm, meditate, breath, go with the flow and continue to stay safe #covid19 #sgcircuitbreaker #whencanigohome #whatayearitsbeen #cantwaitforthistobeover #stayhomestaysafe
