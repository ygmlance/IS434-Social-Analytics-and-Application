Everyday, 5.30pm. My magic workout hour. Weekends I rest. Staying at home means we don‚Äôt stick to schedule and we tend to just nua at home. .

My first month of CB, I was busy watching dramas. Yes I am guilty. üòù Extension of CB, I became very busy with work. Too busy in fact, till I was zooming whole day everyday. But never too late to start. I do have my usual squats and crunches that I do daily. But I noticed because we do not go out, I need to up my workout intensity.

I am really counting down to being able to swim and play badminton cos at least I enjoy those sports better. What are you counting down to?
