Mango Basbousa..
Basbousa aka Harissa.. a famous middle eastern dessert.. basically a syrupy cake made from semolina & coconut flour ...
We often eat this dessert in Turkish restaurant.Since we are not able to go I decided to prepare at home..first time I tried my hands with indian twist  of Alphonso mango flavour #mangolove 😍 & here it is..
🥭Mango Basbousa turned out so good & flavorful .. & I got a big smile.on my face upon my creation 🤩..
🏵Softness of semolina & crunchy hint of coconut makes it utterly delicious & just melts in the mouth ..
I didn't have coconut flour so I went for desiccated coconut...
It's an absolutely fuss free recipe... 🔷️you don't need any fancy ingredients.. just dump everything in one bowl ,mix & bake. it's ready in very short time..
Swipe ➡️ to see the texture & after baking how beautiful it looked..
This is an absolutely fail proof recipe..
💠recipe will be in stories/highlights in short time..
🔶️This is a complete #vegan recipe..
⭐No artificial colour & flavour is used..
This fusion wala treat is my second contribution to #summerfusiontreat by @yummcrumbz @shrutiz_kitchen_journey @asthas_kitchen along with their sponsors @livingclay.ceramicware @bakersvilleindia ...
