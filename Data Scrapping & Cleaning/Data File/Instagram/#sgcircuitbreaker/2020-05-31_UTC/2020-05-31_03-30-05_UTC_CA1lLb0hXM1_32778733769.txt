In need of a weekend cocktail fix? @gibsonbarsg’s Sugarcane Daiquiri is available for delivery to your homes, daily from 12pm–9pm. In the same way that agave nectar (what tequila is made of) is used in the world-renowned Tommy’s Margarita, here Gibson uses sugarcane nectar to brighten the flavour of the rum. Let’s continue to support our eateries in Singapore through this difficult time by ordering via direct islandwide delivery.
