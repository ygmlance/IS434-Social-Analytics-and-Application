I had a conversation recently, with @stellanovamontessori and @abeatriceaday when we discovered an abundance of resources on our children and the environment. And what’s often missing in the equation is how we can adequately prepare ourselves, the adult.
.
We then found some like-minded friends to bounce off ideas... and that was how #thepreparedadult series was conceived.
.
🌿 At the heart of this collaboration is our desire to create a pool of resources for parents who want to learn how to be active participants in our children’s development.
.
🌿 And hopefully in this, we too, as #thepreparedadult , would also experience personal transformation.
.
🌿 We have here, 12 Montessorians who share the same passion. And we will, for the whole of June, bring to you information, ideas and reflections about #thepreparedadult.
.
🌿We also welcome you to use the hashtag so #thepreparedadult can be enriched with resources and ideas!
.
@stellanovamontessori have shared an introductory post on the triangle, and I invite you to hop over to her page to learn more. I’ll be sharing the link to her post in my stories.
