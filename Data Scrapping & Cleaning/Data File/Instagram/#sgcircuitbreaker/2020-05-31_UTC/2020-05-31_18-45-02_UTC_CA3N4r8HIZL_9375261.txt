These monkeys will be the last 2 from the house to be kicked back into the school compounds. How are we going to ensure #3 wears his mask the entire day? Ripping them off and leaving them lying around is a potential situation i foresee. No matter how well we prep them, they feel hot, they itch, who cares what masks what rules. Kids are kids, right? 🤷🏻‍♀️ #theaws #haileyaw #handsomeaw #胡blings #hublings_aw #stayathome #stayhomestaysafe #sgcircuitbreaker
