Amelie took this selfie in the taxi, we have so many photos in our masks in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ but this photo really jumped out at me. Kids living through a pandemic! I wonder how they will remember this time in their lives #maskup #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #lockdown #covid19 #pandemic2020 #singapore
