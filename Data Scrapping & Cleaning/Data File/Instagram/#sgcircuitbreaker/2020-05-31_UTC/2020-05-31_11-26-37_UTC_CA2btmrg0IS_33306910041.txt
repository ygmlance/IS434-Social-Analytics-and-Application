In the morning of #WorldNoTobaccoDay 2020, our P1 son was happy and thankful that there was no secondhand smoke entering our HDB home. He naively thought that smokers gave themselves and the affected neighbours a break from tobacco. In the afternoon, he was rushing to shut our windows and I could tell from his face that he was disappointed. Thus, my young gentleman who dreams of a #smokefreeSG, wrote again a heartfelt appeal to smokers, with tears (literally, thinking of his late grandfather who passed away from #lungcancer though he never smoked in his entire life), pain (see a photo of our child's thumb in the next post) and prayers for the smokers and affected non-smokers worldwide. This writing is the sixth sheet of paper that he used today. When the nearest library @publiclibrarysg re-opens, I will print his heartfelt request instead of letting him re-writing it. Our grade 1 child asked a lot of questions. Who invented cigarettes? | Why were cigarettes invented? | Why do people keep smoking though they know that it is bad for their health? | Why is there World No Tobacco day? https://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/previous/en/ "I hope that everyday is No Tobacco day!" | If there is no more cigarette factory, can the factory workers earn a living for their family?  After all, machines have reduced the number of required workers (https://www.vox.com/2015/3/18/8243707/cigarette-rolling-machines), these workers could re-train to work in other sectors. Indeed, everyone of us has to learn, unlearn (e.g. the #smokinghabit), re-learn to survive. #ThankYouSon #ThankYouFather #ThankYouGrandfather #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #TobaccoExposed #WorldNoTobaccoDay #DearCovid19SG https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
