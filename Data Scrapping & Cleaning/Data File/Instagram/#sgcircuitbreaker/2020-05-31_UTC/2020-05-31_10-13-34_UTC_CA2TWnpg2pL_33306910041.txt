During the #MOESingapore Mid-term break school holiday 2020, our children have drawn everyday heroes and heroines, including #firefighters. We respect every #fireman #firewoman who has risked their lives to save others from the rage of fire. On May 4th, we remembered #InternationalFirefightersDay and made a plan to especially appreciate the firefighters near us #myscdf @myscdf. Though I could not bring my children for her first visit to the iconic #CentralFireStation of Singapore during this school holiday, they enjoyed spotting #RedRhino (a light firefighting vehicle) from our HDB windows. #ThankYouFirefighters #ThankYouEngineers (https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/red-rhino-inspired-batmobile). We thank Dr Lee Bee Wah @leebeewahmp for sharing about the fire in the early hour of 20-May-2020 (https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fire-e-bike-battery-charging-yishun-12751526) and how an off-duty SCDF warrant officer Mr Nasiruddin extinguished the fire before it became worse. | We also have our worries about fire. Our upstairs neighbours littered cigarette butts and lighters, some of them landed on our air-cond latch. They are potential fire hazards. That's why, our son has dreamed for #smokefreeSG. #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #TobaccoExposed #WorldNoTobaccoDay #DearCovid19SG https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
