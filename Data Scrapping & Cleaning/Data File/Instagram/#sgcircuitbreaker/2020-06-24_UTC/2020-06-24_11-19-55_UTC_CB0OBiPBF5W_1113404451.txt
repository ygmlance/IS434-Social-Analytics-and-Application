Some Earl Grey Lavender madeleines I made! 🌸
I always use the Earl Grey Lavender from Gryphon Tea (love to drink their Nymph of the Nile too!) to make my madeleines, because it's my tried and tested go-to ingredient! Even packed a couple boxes to Tassie just for baking when I was there ☺️
この前焼いたの #アールグレイラベンダー #マドレーヌです！
いつも好きなGryphonティで作ってるし、めっちゃいい匂いがする☺️
Swipe to see the bits of tea! 🍵🤤
