𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡𝐲 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐭𝐬⁣⁠
⁣⁣⁣⁠
⁣Most adults are sedentary and immobile.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
Your body wasn’t designed to sit in a chair for eight hours every day at work only to come home and sit on the couch for another three.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
You body was made to move, so start moving.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
Go on walks. Stretch. Lift weights. Do yoga, gymnastics, Pilates, anything.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
Get comfortable moving your body intentionally and through full ranges of motion.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
Somewhere along the way I lost the ability to squat and keep my heels on the ground. This isn’t normal.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
If you look at little kids, they squat all the time. Kids can squat for 20+ minutes while reading a book.⁣⁠
