70% Dark Nama Chocolate with @ballantines Whiskey, recipe from @buttermilkpantry

This was really simple to make! Just make sure to use good chocolate since that's the majority of your base. Made this with Callebaut Couverture buttons. 
Fun fact, about half of Royce's nama chocolate offerings contain alcohol too.
