Have you heard the story of Lord Ganesh and the Moon? Enjoy this Ganesh Chaturthi story!â €
â €
Once Ganesha was riding on his little mouse when suddenly, a snake crossed his path. The mouse was terrified and ran off in fright and Ganesha fell down.â €
â €
The Moon saw this and began to laugh at the fallen Ganesha. Annoyed, Ganesha broke off one of his tusks and threw it at the Moon. As it struck the Moon, it lost all brightness.â €
â €
Dejected, the Moon went away. The world turned dark. People got scared, they screamed and wept. All the Gods were worried by the confusion. They prayed to Ganesha, "Please restore the Moon's brightness" The Moon also repented and prayed to be forgiven. â €
â €
Ganesha relented but he wanted to teach the Moon a lesson. So he proclaimed that the moon would grow thinner ðŸŒ™ each day and remain invisible for one day in a month, which is Amavasya.â €
â €
Lord Ganesha's story explains how anger gets to the best of us, but it is in our power to overcome it that makes us a better human being.ðŸ˜Œ
