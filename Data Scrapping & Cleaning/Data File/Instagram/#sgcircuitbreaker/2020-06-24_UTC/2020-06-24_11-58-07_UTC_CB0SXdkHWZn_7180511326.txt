For such days, #yinyoga is perfect for you.⁠
⁠
Here we have the yin version of the dragonfly pose, which provides a nice opening for your lower body, particularly the hips, groin, and hamstrings.⁠
⁠
We love this pose because it is like giving Mother Earth 🌾  a BIG HUG, surrendering to nature, and diving into serenity🍃. This pose is also part of our upcoming #functionalyin class launching in July.⁠
⁠
Functional yin yoga honours the uniqueness within our unique sense of self. It guides us to take a journey to explore our physical body, and harness its wholesomeness towards our mental and emotional self. ⁠
⁠
💜 There is no judgment, no competition. This is an experience to feel rather than speak or see.
