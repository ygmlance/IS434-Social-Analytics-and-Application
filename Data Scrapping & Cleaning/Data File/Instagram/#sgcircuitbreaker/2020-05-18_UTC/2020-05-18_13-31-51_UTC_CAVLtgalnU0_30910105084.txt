Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 42:
Practiced another @abccookingstudio_sg recipe! Still need to work on the shaping technique as each bun had a slightly different appearance ðŸ˜… 
The original recipe these Cherry Twist buns used white bean paste but I replaced it with red bean paste instead. Breakfast for hubs is settled!
