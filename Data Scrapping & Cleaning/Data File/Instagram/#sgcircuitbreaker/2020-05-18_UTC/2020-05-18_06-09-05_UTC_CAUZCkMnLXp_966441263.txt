You know you are too bored when u start playing with your food haha. I made instant noodle burger! Actually its only the patty of the burger made of the noodles. Rest of the inside meat, veg and sauces you can change it to your liking. I had mine with fish fillets, egg, cheese and coriander haha. These are the steps i followed (1) cook dry instant noodles as per normal (2) add in 1 egg (3) cling wrap it to shape (4) chill for at least 30mins (5) panfry with oil. Just for novelty. ➡️Picture 1 was what i envision my double fish burger to look like ➡️Picture 2 i was trying to deconstruct it ➡️ Picture 3 was how i actually ate it in the end
