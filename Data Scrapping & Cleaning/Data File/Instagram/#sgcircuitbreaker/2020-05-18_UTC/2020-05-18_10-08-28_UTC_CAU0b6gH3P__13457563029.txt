My playdough recipe has been tried over and over again, and I’m very confident you’ll find that this is the easiest way to make nice smelling dough with the best texture!
.
🤹🏻 I hope you’ll give it a go, because this is really one of the best toys children want to have in their play space.

I started making my own dough because I wasn’t happy with the store-bought set. The first time 👧🏻 played with it, I had a hard time cleaning up. It had a funny smell and I couldn’t find the ingredient list - too much mystery there.
.
I started looking out for homemade ones and I’ve tried many recipes since.
.
🙌🏼 With the multiple experimentations, I devised my best way to make playdough quickly and simply - because, 🤷🏻‍♀️ I’m a time-deprived mama.
.
This recipe I have here is what I find the best  and easiest way to make playdough - you’ll have a soft + fragrant but not-sticky dough - and I want to share it with you.
.
Pro tip:
🍡 Follow the recipe word for word (eg boiling water and extra fine salt are truly essential) - except for oil - you may choose what type you want to use.
🍡 Use a kitchen mixer to help you. A paddle mixer and a dough hook will be really handy.
.
🌿 If you are looking for one Montessori toy to own, then playdough is a must for your collection.
.
🌿 It is therapeutic to play with (for all ages!), trains those tiny hand muscles, and I bet, your kids will never get tired of playing with it!
.
♥️ I created a recipe card for you. Save it, share it or tag a friend who might find it useful.
.
Have fun!
