| Hanging Beads Mobile |‚Å£
‚Å£
A collaborative threading effort by the siblings. Using jewellery thin wire and a mixture of beads and buttons we have. The thin wire is the easiest materials I can find for then to thread through. A step up from chenille stems üòÜ. ‚Å£
‚Å£
We took about two weeks to complete this. Sometimes, the kids are not careful and let go of the end of the wire, the whole column of beads will drop to the floor and bounce everywhere. Hanging this in the living room to remind us no matter how difficult things get, we can overcome it together and make something beautiful out of it. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Å£
