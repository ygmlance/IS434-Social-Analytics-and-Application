RENGA-YA : HOUSE OF JAPANESE YAKINIKU BBQ. @rengayasg 
All the Japanese beef ingredients are imported directly from the factories of origin by Renga-Ya to ensure the traceability of the beef. Besides the traditional Japanese charcoal BBQ, wide variety of side dishes, and Sake/Wines are prepared for unique dining experience.

Yakiniku is an old friend to the Japanese. It‚Äôs simple cooking; grilling meat over a charcoal fire. That‚Äôs why the quality of ingredients is essential. At Renga-Ya, they serve only the freshest and the best.

We tried the following recently and would recommend this place if you are craving for some authentic Japanese food.

Charcoal Grilled King Prawn Mentai Bento, the king prawn is big and mentai sauce goes perfectly with it.

Charcoal Grilled Wagyu Steak Set, soft juicy wagyu that is their signature here at Rengaya. Next is the Charcoal Grilled Oyako Don, the chicken is not dry and retain its soft texture. It is not overly grilled like in some places the chicken is harden and difficult to eat. Another of our favourite is the Japanese Beef curry rice. Soft tender beef cooked just the right texture in Japanese curry. This dish is very easy to fall in love especially the curry over the rice.
