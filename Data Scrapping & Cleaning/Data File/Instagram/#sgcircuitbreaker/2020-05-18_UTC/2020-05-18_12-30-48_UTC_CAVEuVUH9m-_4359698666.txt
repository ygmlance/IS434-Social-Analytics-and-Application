Eclairs ($7.50-$8.50)
⭐️ 4/5 ⭐️
🍴 Have always enjoyed these artisan and delicate eclairs that are of good flavour profiles and have a nicely soft choux pastry. Most were sold-out by afternoon time so we only got our hands on the #lycheepeach ($8.50) which was topped with roses to give a flora aroma. However, the cream was quite light and we could hardly taste the lychee or peach 😅. The #lemoneclair ($8) was more classic and we enjoyed its sourness and tanginess
⚠️ These #eclairs are on the pricey side which  is what restrains us from indulging in them but do note that there are plenty of discounts now. They are currently offering 25% off all online orders for the #sgcircuitbreaker period although these preorder spots are quick to run out. They are also found on #entertainer and #burpplebeyond, and on #shopbackgo for additional 25% cashback
