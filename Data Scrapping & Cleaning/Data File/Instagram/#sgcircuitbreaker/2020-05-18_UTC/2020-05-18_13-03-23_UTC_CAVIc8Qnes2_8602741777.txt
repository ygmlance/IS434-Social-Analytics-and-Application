Blue : Hey Lloyd, remember the time when we visited the National Museum in Singapore?

Lloyd : I sure do Blue! Why do you ask?

Blue : Todayâ€™s National Museum Day and I wanted to visit a museum but none are open due to the Circuit Breaker.

Lloyd : There are lots of virtual museum tours Blue! What say we do one of those instead?
