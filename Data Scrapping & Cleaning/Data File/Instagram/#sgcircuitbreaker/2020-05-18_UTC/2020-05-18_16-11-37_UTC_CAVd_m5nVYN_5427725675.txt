ðŸŽ¨ As promised, here are a couple of our wooden blocks making another appearance in this week's #mathmondayfun post (theme: simple counting). I taped up each block to use them as dice: one with the numbers 1, 2 and 3 written on them, in numeral form and as dots, and the other with the colours red, orange, yellow, green and blue on five sides, with the sixth side showing all five colours.

ðŸŽ¨ The two dice, the strips of coloured paper I had cut out and a stick of glue were all we needed for this little game that the Little One enjoyed playing even more than I had hoped he would. We took turns rolling the dice to determine the number and colour of paper strips we would glue on to each of our paper chains. If your colour dice falls showing the face with all five colours you get to pick what colour, or combination of colours, to use. The Little One got a real kick out of that feature of the game!

ðŸŽ¨ He kept counting the rings in both our paper chains with each roll of the dice to see who would have the longer chain and it somehow ended up equalðŸ˜‹

ðŸŽ¨ While having the advantage of being easy to set up and giving me some one-on-one quality time with the Little One, this game was also a good way for him to work on his fine motor skills and hand eye coordination, with all that gluing and pasting. It took him a few tries to get the hang of how to stick each paper ring together but he was soon at it like a pro ðŸ˜‹ This is also a fun way to introduce number and colour identification to younger children.
