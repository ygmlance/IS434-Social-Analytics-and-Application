Tonight's homecooked udon noodle soup for dinner with some prawns, sliced pork, carrot, veg and mushrooms. We didn't have any Japanese soup base at home so we improvised with whatever we had. The udon went well with our improvised soup - at least this was something different from our usual fare.
. 
Time to go get some proper dashi or Japanese soup stock!
