“With each new interaction of old and new memories, the map lines shift, the places change again as they stay the same again. ... In this city, the past layers over and under the present, and I am transported back into a patina of other places, still existing, always fading, but never disappearing.”

A pensive, lyrical collection of essays perfect for the remainder of the circuit breaker, Indelible City ponders identity, cities, maps and home. When it is time for us to wander the streets again, what will have changed, what will we remember, and who will we have become by then?
