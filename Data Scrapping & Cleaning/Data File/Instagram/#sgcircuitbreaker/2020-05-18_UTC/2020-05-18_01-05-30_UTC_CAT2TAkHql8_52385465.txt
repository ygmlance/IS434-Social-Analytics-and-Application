CB Day #42

Great morning! It's Monday! 
2 more weeks to go!

Cody is super flexible and "pattern more than badminton". Pulled out the bedding and slept on the floor.

Was wondering how he positioned his feet and he lifted his head to show me his intertwined Limbs. Aiyoh, u can feel my vibes! ðŸ˜† 
Boy, it's time for your bath and grooming session!
