CB Day 42...
Time to pamper myself after so many days of workout! Thanks to @skyhui18 for the early bday present!

I must say this Ellure Tomato Bubble Mask is really goooooooood! The pores at my nose area can clearly tell that they are full of black/white heads and usually Iâ€™ll squeeze them out myself and my pores became damn big. After putting this mask, I can totally feel that the pores are all cleared and visually smaller! Can also feel that the usual skincare products I put on like essence and moisturiser are much better absorbed too! Really quite thumbs up!
