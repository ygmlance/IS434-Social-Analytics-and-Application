🤕What’s the dumbest way you’ve been injured? If you could name an ice-cream, what would it be called? 🍦What’s your biggest screw up in the kitchen? 🔥🔪🧤

💬 We answer these and more in my very first IG Live TV!

👯‍♀️ Serendipitously, Dee did her first Facebook Live with me on a project for Neutrogena 3 years ago, where we made her write blindfolded, with a stack of books on her head and with her left hand 😏 Now, I've done my first IG Live with her! She was much more gracious with me though, and we tackled ice breaker questions, chosen by YOU! 🙌🏻
.
💻 Why did we do this? We were laughing over Skype last weekend and thought: Maybe other people would like to be chatting and laughing with us too 🎥 So we decided to go live, get inputs from the friends who joined in and spread some happy chatty energy in our corner of IG!✨💖✨
.
I’ve added titles, so you scroll to the questions you’ve been dyingg to know the answers to! 😜
.
We're thinking of doing this next week, this time with storytelling AND painting 📖🎨🖌️ Mummy and daddy friends, which do you prefer? 👋🏻 Friday afternoon or Saturday afternoon? ⏰ Let us know in the comments below, and we'll make it HAPPEN!
