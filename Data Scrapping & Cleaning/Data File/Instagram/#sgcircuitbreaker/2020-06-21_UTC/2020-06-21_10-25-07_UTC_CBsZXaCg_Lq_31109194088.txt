As we enter Phase 2, we hope everyone took the opportunity to rest, relax and recharge during the circuit breaker! It must have been tough for all you mommas, but hey, we survived! We did it! Let's all embrace this new norm and all differences that come with it! And remember, shops and businesses are reopening because of the economy and not because it's safe. So we should continue to be socially responsible, and stay home as much as you can, so that we can rid this virus completely.
