We love rainy days🌧 , do you?⁠
⁠
Sometimes when we are feeling down, we can look to the falling rain ⛈  from the sky as Nature's way of showing sympathy, and empathising with us. She helps us cry out the sadness that we are unable to put into words. It is comforting to know she is crying with us. ⁠
⁠
In the past few days, the rain has been a constant companion in our days - sometime in the morning, sometimes into the night. ⁠
⁠
However, rain also offers us moments of freshness, relaxation, calm, hope, and a sense of rebirth🌿. With it, time seems to slow down and allows us to appreciate and enjoy what we have in our lives today🤗. ⁠
⁠
Either way, we always welcome the rain because we know there will always be rainbows after the rain.⁠
