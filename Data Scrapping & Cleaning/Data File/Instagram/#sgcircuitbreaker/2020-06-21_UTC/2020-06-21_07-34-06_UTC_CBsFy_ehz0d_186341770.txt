[Fathers' Day Special - An uncanny Discovery]
.
When I was little, my dad taught me about the world, he showed me his travel photographs, and told me fascinating travel tales when he travelled around the world. It was a very long time ago.. about 30 years ago... ‚ô•Ô∏è
.
I garnered interest about the world from him, he will never forget to get me toys or something from the places he visited. He always had so many things to share, not just material items but his life experiences. ‚ô•Ô∏è
.
He once told me the world has no borders, only human mapped it among ourselves. He inspired and impacted my life with his great wisdom and wide vast of knowledge. ‚ô•Ô∏è
.
Sometimes when I was travelling, I could sense his presence around me. Typically the incident in Vienna (his favourite city in the world, as he was a musician). I went for a musical concert in one of the famously oldest concert hall in Vienna. As I was travelling alone, I paid for the lowest tiered seats, but was upgraded for free for no reasons. I was told it was full, but strangely there was an empty seat right beside me throughout the concert. That night my connection with him felt typically strong in the concert hall. ‚ô•Ô∏è

As some of you might  know, back in 2013, I went back to his old travel albums (hardcopies of course), to my shocking discovery, I notice a lot of similarities to my travel photos (before TI360 time). The poses, the style and even the spot we stood were identical. Just different time zone. I got a lot of goosebumps that evening and decided to make a collage. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Dad's loves are amazing. Its powerful, strong, impactful and everlasting! He taught us great things! And he sacrificed his life for us to live a better life! üò≠
.
Yes, we wish he could still be with us!  Wish to tell him how much we love him and wants him to continue watch us grow and progress. How much we wish he could spend more time with the little monsters. How much we miss his cooking and how much we miss him! ‚ô•Ô∏è

Treasure everyday u have with your love ones. Make everyday a Fathers' Day cos they truly deserves it. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Happy Fathers's Day. üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
