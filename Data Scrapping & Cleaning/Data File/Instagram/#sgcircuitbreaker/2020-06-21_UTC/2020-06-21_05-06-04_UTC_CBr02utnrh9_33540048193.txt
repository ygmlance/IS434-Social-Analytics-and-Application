Delicious food from @whitebeehoonrestaurant to celebrate father's day at home! Delivery came right on time and we didn't have to wait at all.

Our order consisted of their signature white beehoon, seafood roll, fried tofu, salted egg sotong, sweet and sour pork rib and veg. All in medium size except for the beehoon which was large. It was enough to feed 6 adults and 2 kids. My favourite dish was the white beehoon!
