It used to be the case that our comfort zone and our safety zone were more or less the same thing.⁣⁠⁣⁠
⁣⁠⁣⁠
That uncomfortable feeling you got when you encountered a snarling bear was because you were in immediate physical danger.⁣⁠⁣⁠
⁣⁠⁣⁠
Life is pretty safe now. The most dangerous thing we do is driving, and even that’s pretty safe. Yet we’re all completely comfortable with driving and uncomfortable with far safer activities like public speaking.⁣⁠⁣⁠
⁣⁠⁣⁠
The comfort zone is no longer a reliable indicator of the safety zone.⁣⁠⁣⁠
⁣⁠⁣⁠
If you want to level up, you’re going to need to do things that scare the living daylights out of you.⁣⁠⁣⁠
⁣⁠⁣⁠
If what you wanted could be found in your comfort zone, you’d already have it.⁣⁠⁣⁠
