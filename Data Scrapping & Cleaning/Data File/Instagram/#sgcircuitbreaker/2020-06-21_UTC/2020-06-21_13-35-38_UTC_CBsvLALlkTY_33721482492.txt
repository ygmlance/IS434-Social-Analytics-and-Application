Holy Smokes (iii) | Father’s Day 2020
.
Thank you to all the fathers who support us by putting bread on the table and for being mentors in more ways than one. Hope everyone had a restful weekend with family!
.
A particularly huge thank you to my daddy taxi/delivery man - thanks for always supporting my passions and loves. For being sometimes emotionally constipated, but always loving. Happy Father’s Day
