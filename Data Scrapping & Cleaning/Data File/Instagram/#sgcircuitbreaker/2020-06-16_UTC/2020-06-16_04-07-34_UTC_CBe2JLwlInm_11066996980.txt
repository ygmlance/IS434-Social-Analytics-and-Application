Singapore’s top social media platform is #YouTube. This is followed closely by Facebook, and subsequently, Instagram and Twitter in the third and fourth spot.

Statistics from Google, App Annie, and Kantar TNS also show that 82% of all internet users in #Singapore access YouTube each month. 
Are you contributing to that percentage? 🙋🏻
