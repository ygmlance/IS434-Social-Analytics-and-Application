In the midst of the Circuit Breaker period, @laifabar started a fundraising campaign for the seniors at Lions Befrienders. Most of these elders do not have anyone to care for them and are no longer able to provide for themselves. The COVID-19 situation only made things even harder due to a lack of volunteers and sponsors. In this initiative, aptly named “Lai Fa Cares”, nutritious meals were delivered to the doorsteps of the seniors to ensure they did not have to worry about their next meal. Such people are truly a blessing to this community, going out of their way to help others in need. Let’s continue to support one another through this difficult period. How can you bless someone in need today?
