This is mee rebus from stall A (refer to previous post).
.
Once again, stall A has outshine stall B with their mee rebus.
.
Stall A’s gravy is smooth and subtly sweet. I believe they thickened their gravy with potato.
.
On the other hand, stall B’s gravy was lumpy (sometimes curdled like glue) as they probably used starch to thicken theirs.
.
Stall A is the clear winner.
.
I think stall A may have gotten their mojo back. It should be safe to patronize them again.
.
Mee siam next!
