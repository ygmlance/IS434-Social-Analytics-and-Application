Throughout the 2 years, regardless of my postings and time of book out, he would always try his best to pick me up so that I won't have to travel home with all my heavy bags. On the weekends, he would also arrange simple family outings to restaurants so that I can have some nice food. He would then bring me to the supermarket to get some necessities like biscuits and vitamin C that I can bring to camp so I can stay full and healthy. After this, he will drive and send me back to camp. The cycle consistently repeats itself and before I know it, 2 years just passed like that.\nPerhaps, the fondest memory I have of him is not an episodic event but an accumulation of love and dedicated efforts overtime. I would like to thank my dad for his love throughout the years. Happy Father's Day! :D\n\n@churavel @limzhenyang @_linying_",

Every single thing is important to take note as you will not know what will happen next. \nFrom young he always taught me to defend and protect myself especially safety as he told me is important wherever you go. A wisdom person who i always remember any single words he told me.\nHe will look after me no matter how busy he is and given lots of care & support. \nThere was once during my younger days i almost die at train station and staff quickly call my dad. My superhero quickly rush from home to the location giving me support to recuse me from death. He will always help those who in need of help no matter how busy he is.\nA great and kind man who always treat everybody sincerely.

And even release our sky lantern with our wishes written. \nMy parents had always been reluctant to travel cos of their food stall that they had been conscientiously\ud83d\udcaa working hard on to raise us 4kids . They had been really frugal and unwilling to spend much on themselves . So now we are all grown up , i decided to pamper them with this overseas holiday that they can enjoy and looking forward . \nMy dad was really elated and he told me he always been wanting to travel but always can\u2019t find time to go due to us , which I really felt bad on not been able to bring her earlier . \nI told my dad I shall bring him and mom more often to travel with us . I could see the glow in his face and now we tried to make it a point to travel yearly to the place they wanted to travel to. \nDuring the trip, I confessed to him being the youngest daughter I always made him and mom worry . Now being a mom myself I totally understand how it feels and really apologetic for all the rebellious acts and worries that I created for him and never failed to understand them as a working parents whom I always felt neglected . \nHe held my hands and told me you are my Daughter and of course I love and care for you. That  really made me teared when I heard his words . Thanks to him for his unwavering love for me and my family that he never give up on me . \nThankful that with the trip we became a lot closer to each other . \nThanks @liminal.sg for this generous prize and hope to be the lucky blessed Daughter to win for my dad\u2019s home. \n@layhoontoh @hlgoh.sg @gohsk7676 \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4d",

So one time, when I accidentally dropped a glass and spilt its sweet contents all over the floor at home, I immediately froze out of fear and broke into tears just imagining the scolding I was going to get from mom. She would be LIVID and start on her tirade about how I was so careless and that the ants would come etc. However, before mom arrived at the scene of my \"crime\", dad came to my rescue! He calmly told me to wipe away my tears and think about what we should do next to clean up the mess. Together, we quietly worked through sweeping up the glass shards and mopping up the liquid - not once did he berate me about the accident. That day, I learned that when faced with a bad situation, do not panic; instead, be practical! Take a breath and think of the possible solutions instead of being overwhelmed by your emotions. It's a lesson I practise to this day, and that I hope to pass on to my own children in the future! \ud83d\ude0a",

He is a man of few words, generous, loving and someone who is righteous. His love for the family is often unspoken and undeniable as he will quietly work hard and persevere even when the burden took a toil on him. His love is always catered for his own brothers and the family. I feel heartpain for him as most of the work burdens are on him. His brothers took up minority of the work. He will always go to his workplace every night and sleep for 3 to 4 hours before his goods arrive, to prepare, and to handle most of the crowds by himself. He has to brave through cold blowing wind every night too. As time pass, his health is not as healthy as before. As a daughter, there is nothing much i can do than giving him the best that i can. I feel thankful for his selfless love, love us abundantly, his care and concern. His undivided love for his daughters. I cannot wait to keep my parents safe and protected at their home sweet home. My way of loving him - I love you daddy! Happy Father's Day! @susantan1506 @susanglc @salina_bellona  FB: Bycl Lim",

Throughout the 2 years, regardless of my postings and time of book out, he would always try his best to pick me up so that I won't have to travel home with all my heavy bags. On the weekends, he would also arrange simple family outings to restaurants so that I can have some nice food. He would then bring me to the supermarket to get some necessities like biscuits and vitamin C that I can bring to camp so I can stay full and healthy. After this, he will drive and send me back to camp. The cycle consistently repeats itself and before I know it, 2 years just passed like that.\nPerhaps, the fondest memory I have of him is not an episodic event but an accumulation of love and dedicated efforts overtime. I would like to thank my dad for his love throughout the years. Happy Father's Day! :D\n\n@churavel @limzhenyang @_linying_",
