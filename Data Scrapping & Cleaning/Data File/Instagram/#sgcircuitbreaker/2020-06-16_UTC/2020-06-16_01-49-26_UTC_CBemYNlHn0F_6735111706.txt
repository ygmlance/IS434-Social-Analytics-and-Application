SINGAPORE 🇸🇬 — Cheers to staying safe these past few months. Cheers to being responsible (for those of us who actually were). Cheers for phase 2 and cheers to finally being able to get ourselves a drink.. Outside.

Just a reminder to everyone of you that while certain bans may be lifted, it doesn’t mean the situation should be taken lightly either. Observe and practice social distancing and keep a minimum of 1-meter apart! ☝🏼
