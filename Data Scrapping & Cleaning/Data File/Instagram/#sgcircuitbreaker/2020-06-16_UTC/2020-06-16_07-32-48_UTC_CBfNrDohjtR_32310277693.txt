The wait is finally over! Phase 2 will officially kick in this coming Saturday! We are excited to see everyone in our store again but if you choose to stay home, our delivery service is still available! We will be starting free pick up service once we implement safety measures in our store and we hope to see you on and offline soon! Stay safe!
