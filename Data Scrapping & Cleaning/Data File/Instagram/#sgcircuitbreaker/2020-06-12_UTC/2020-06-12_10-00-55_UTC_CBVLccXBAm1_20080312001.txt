Webinar attendees provide information to attend your webinar. You can also have virtually unlimited attendees at a single webinar! From a bare-minimum standpoint, that's like collecting a bunch of business cards.
.
But it's much more than that - webinars provide the benefit of almost filtering out or building up a lead. Since they are interested in attending your webinar in the first place, you know they are a qualified lead. They were seeking the benefit of your webinar first - this means they're interested in what you have to offer.
.
Also the kind of information you receive from your participants through your webinar can be very valuable. It may be that you can collect potential leads' job titles, responses to any polls or Q&A's you used in your webinar - and much more intimate data than simply a name and email address!
