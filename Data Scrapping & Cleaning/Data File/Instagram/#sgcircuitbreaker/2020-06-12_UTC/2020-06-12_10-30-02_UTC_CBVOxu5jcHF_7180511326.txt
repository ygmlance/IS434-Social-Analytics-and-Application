😍 Let's do a simple stretch at any time of the day!

Standing forward fold is a great way to stretch your hips, hamstrings, calves🦵, and bring relaxation to the nervous system.
.
The most important thing is not to become how it looks, but how it feels!
.
The idea of "keep the leg straight" isn't the goal of the pose. Instead, focus on closing the gap between belly and thighs while actively pressing down on all four corners of your feet to lift the pelvic! If you feel like your body is falling forward, you may touch your butt on wall to support your balancing.
.
Our new wall yin class will begin this sunday, 4.30pm. Join us and learn beginner-friendly poses on how to use the wall to rebalance our energies and bring much more equilibrium into our daily lives.🧘‍♀️
