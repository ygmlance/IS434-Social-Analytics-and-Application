The Best is Yet to Come!⁠
⁠
When we were kids, we were always ready to try new things, to paint, draw, and most of us were purely positive. As as the years go by, we clutter our mind with doubts, fears and self-deprecating thoughts. These thoughts can limit our potential and we may never know what we're actually capable of. It's not easy but as a starter, here are some tips: ⁠
⁠
⭐Substitute every negative thought for a positive one ⁠
⭐See the positive side to every situation ⁠
⭐Take time off every day to reflect on 5 things that you're grateful for ⁠
⭐Change the mental images that come to your mind ⁠
⁠
Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep working on yourself and your mind will automatically reject its negative thoughts and welcome the positive ones.⁠ ⁠
⁠
Why don't we take this opportunity on a Friday night to reflect on what happened this week, and what you're grateful for? A little step goes a long way! ⁠
