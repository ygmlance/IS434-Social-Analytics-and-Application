Mango Peda or Aam peda..
Am back with mango post again.. #mangomania 😍..
Since I had seen the gorgeous pedas made by Neha @saltsugarnspice (bana liye pede 😋)I was so craving for it ... since then it was in my list..
As Mangoes are still there so thought of why not go for mango flavour🥭.. & there it is..
Needless to say these pedas are packed with flavours & taste wonderful ..
You just need mango pulp,milk powder & sugar that's it. With these minimal ingredients you can prepare these pedas under 15 mins... probably the most easiest recipe of any Indian sweet..
🔷️It's a must try recipe & the taste definitely beats the store bought ones...
💮Easy peasy Recipe is in stories/highlights...
🏵Swipe to see the #nofilter pic & the beautiful texture..
