So I scored some fiddlehead ferns from my girlfriend. If you are not familiar, this is a typical spring veggie. You would usually see them in farmers' markets in the spring. I love the crunch of fiddleheads and I love the spiral look too...I also had spring green onions which is diff from scallions. It's leaves are stiffer and taste great charred. 
Tonight, I made dry tom yum prawn stir fry with fiddlehead ferns, charred spring onion tips and mushrooms 
1 cup of fiddlehead ferns
8-10 shrimp
1 clove garlic
1 Tbsp sambal prawn paste
1 red chilli 
Handful of Mushrooms 
Spring Green onions, sliced into long strips
1.5 Tbsp Fish sauce  Juice of half lemon

This recipe requires you to toast fermented prawn paste (so prevalent in Thai and southeast Asian cooking) the come in blocks (kind of like the Asian bullion cubes but a lot more pungent!) I crumble a tablespoon of the prawn paste in my frying pan to toast and release the flavor. Then I pound it with a clove of garlic and chilli. In this case I didn't have fresh red chilli (which is ideal) so I improvised + used 2 tsp Mr Bing's Chilli sauce @mrbingnyc

Get your wok piping hot. Take your green onions and sear them at the bottom of the pan until they have a nice char. Add the chilli paste. Stir to mix. Add the fiddleheads. Add  fish sauce,  mushrooms. Add a squeeze of half a lemon. .
