Dinner last night was baked cauliflower “steaks” 🌿This time I used tahini as my base for coating instead of Greek yohgurt. 🌿 I mixed it with lemon juice, a bit of water, ground cumin, salt, pepper, ground coriander and dried parsley. 🌿 The recipe is simple, straightforward and totally flexible in terms of what you want to add to your base. 🌿
