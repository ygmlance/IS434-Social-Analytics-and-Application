When you have great lighting, photo always comes out great.
When you have a positive mind, your day always comes out awesome.

I am kind of enjoying  this Circuit Breaker more than I expected. When circuit breaker was first initiated, I was so worried. I used to meet my clients physically for follow ups and chat about life then suddenly all these have to stop. I was worried that my clients would stop their program.

When I went for a training, a mentor (who used to be a orange picker) reminded me that our environment don't define us, we define our environment. We have a choice.

I started making plans to call my clients, communicate with them frequently and encourage their to join our Just 10 Days Online program since they are at home anyways. Best opportunity to lose weight cause minimal distraction. The change was hard and its needs to be done. 
I am truely grateful to my team and my clients. Even though I am at home, I am still able to help people get into amazing shape. It's really exciting when you you received messages from clients sharing their journey so far, enjoying the process and improving their health.

How's your circuit Breaker coming along?
