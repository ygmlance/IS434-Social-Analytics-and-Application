The body feels different each time even though it is the same class on the same day and same time. We learn to listen, accept and let go. As Mariah says- It is what it is ðŸ¦‹ðŸ¦‹ (Same for the Circuit Breaker) Today I felt good after doing some Backbend poses in class. So I have the extra motivation to self practice. Since is all about distancing nowadays, my theme is Chakrasana distancingðŸ˜€ I tried to move maybe  1 foot distance towards my hands. Can you tell? Just having fun with the ruler. Not obsessed with moreðŸ˜‚
