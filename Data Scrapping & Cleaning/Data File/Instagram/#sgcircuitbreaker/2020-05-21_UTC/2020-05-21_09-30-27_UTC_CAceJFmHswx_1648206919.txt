One of the most recognizable local dishes you will find, and certainly one of our most sought after!

Ngor Hiang is all about texture, and we’ve really pulled no punches when it comes to finding that perfect crunch. When you bite into it, what you’ll experience is the tenderness of the pork, then the juiciness of the prawns.

In between bites, the crispiness of that beancurd skin starts to take effect. Then of course, the fragrance of the seasoning and spices shine through with every bite.

A great amount of care goes into each Ngor Hiang roll. We fry them on-demand and ship them out ASAP, so that when it arrives at your house, you can still feel the love.

Now all that’s left is to choose what sauce to have it with. What’s your favourite sauce for Ngor Hiang?

For all you hungries, we’re open everyday for lunch and dinner, and we offer FREE ISLANDWIDE DELIVERY for orders $50 and above. Link in bio.
