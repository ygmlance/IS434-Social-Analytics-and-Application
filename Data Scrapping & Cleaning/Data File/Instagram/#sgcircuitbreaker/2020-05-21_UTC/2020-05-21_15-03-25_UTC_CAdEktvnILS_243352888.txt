Took leave tomorrow, so I’ve got a longgg weekend ahead!⁠ 💃🏻⠀
.⁠⠀
Things I wanna do, as two-day weekends just aren’t enough!⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
🔸Have bubble tea!⠀
🔹Sleep in every. single. day. ⠀
🔸Record some storytelling videos!⁠⠀
🔹 Record some videos for fun. Still on the fence about TikTok! 🤔⠀
🔸Update my website ⁠(omg, so many painful stories)⠀
🔹Make something in the kitchen⠀
🔸Support three small local businesses with my wallet⠀
🔹Work on a secret project for end-of-the-year⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Most of all, I’m committing to feeling whoopdido if I do 3/4 of this list. I tend to growl about how I’ve not done much every Sunday night, even when I’ve been doing doing doing. Not this weekend! 🙅🏻‍♀️ I’m gonna give myself a high five for every thing I tick off. Remind me on Monday night, ok?! 🙈⠀
