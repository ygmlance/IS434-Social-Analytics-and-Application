Have eggs for breakfast! Here’s why:
1. Extremely easy to prepare (just hard boil them if you’re lazy😂)
2. Keeps you full
3. High in protein which helps increase your metabolism early on in the day
4. High in nutritional value (vitamins, phosphorus, selenium, calcium, zinc & healthy fats)
5. Helps raise good cholesterol

Hope this info helps make your future breakfasts more EGGciting!😂👍🏻 Take care everybody😊 #eatinghealthy #breakfast #nutrition #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #goodfood #healthylifestyle #healthyfood #powerfoods #diet #healthydiet #health
