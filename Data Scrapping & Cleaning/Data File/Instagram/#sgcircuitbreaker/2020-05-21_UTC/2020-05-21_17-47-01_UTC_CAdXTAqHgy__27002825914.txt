😻SHERMS COOKS: THE BEST BURGER
No I don't even think it's an exaggeration. This burger is so delicious. I really need to do it more often.

Carbs➡️Brioche hamburger bun from @bakerybrera. Omg it's so good, it stands up perfectly to the beef patty, absorbing the juices without getting soggy. It's super fluffy and buttery too :) I toasted it and have Dijon mustard on one bun half and @thelokalsingapore homemade fermented ketchup on the other (legit ketchup really makes a huge difference wow 😮)

Protein➡️Beef burger patty from @ryansgrocery_sg. I sous vide it to medium rare then seared it off for a minute on each side. It's so incredibly delicious and tender. The juices just drip onto my fingers as I take each bite, and I can tell it's super good quality meat. I have a slice of mozzarella cheese melted on top of the patty.

Veggie➡️The salad in the background is just a simple spinach salad with cauliflower rice, juicy cherry tomatoes and cucumber with a generous drizzle of fat-free Italian dressing.
