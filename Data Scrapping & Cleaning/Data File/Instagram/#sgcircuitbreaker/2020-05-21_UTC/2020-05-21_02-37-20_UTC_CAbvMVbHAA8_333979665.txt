Morning ”tea” that's has anti-inflammatory and antiviral benefits! We recommend a pretty cup to drink from! 😍😂🌹. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of Nature’s Superfoods Raw Ginger Powder with 2 teaspoons of Nature’s Superfoods Raw Honey in warm water and enjoy it with a that book you've been wanting to start since the circuit breaker!
