As we work towards making Singapore more sustainable, many individuals in our community are going the extra mile. 🏃 They do not only incorporate sustainability into their own lives but also spread this important message to their friends and followers! 🤩

How have members of our local community contributed towards a sustainable Singapore? 🤔 Join us on Sun, 24 May at 2pm in our latest #GreenAtHomeSG event titled ‘We’re In This Together’ to find out!

Featuring graphics 🎨 illustrated by local eco-advocate @earthtodorcas, an ONLINE fabric 👕 multi-holder upcycling workshop and a photo-taking activity 📸 where you can showcase your own sustainability contributions to your friends and followers!

To participate, simply follow us on our Facebook or our Instagram or indicate your interest in our Facebook event (link in bio)! See you on Sunday at 2pm!
