Finally getting to this at home. There's not much space and height but it's better than nothing! Just enjoying the simple shapes and the spin. Can't wait to try it at the studio :( Thank you @hangoutwithkathy for the inspiration and the encouragement. Originally seen by @miss_macaroni . Love that twisty shape! Finding new pathways out of the move! .
