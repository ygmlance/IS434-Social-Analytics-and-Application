CB / lockdown taught us many things in past few months . We learnt how to enjoy a small simple celebration at home with very limited supplies in hand. Bake a homemade cake , cook party food at home, make hand made card & decor and not to forgot dress up like a princess wherever you are.

P.S This ‘big sister’ dress was for my mum baby shower we did last December. .
