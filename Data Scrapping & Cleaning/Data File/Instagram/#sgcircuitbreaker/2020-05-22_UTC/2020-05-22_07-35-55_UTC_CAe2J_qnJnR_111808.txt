My pandemic-induced depression is getting worse, triggered by an episode at the hospital yesterday when I was denied entry because of my chronic autoimmune fever. I had a doctor’s letter detailing my chronic and noninfectious fever but it was flat out rejected. After a bit of a struggle where the staff and doctor of my clinic were involved - I managed to get in to refill my much needed prescriptions. 
But at the same time, I cannot help but wonder what’s going to happen when I return for my physio/rheumo appointments as early as next month, and the ubiquitous temperature screening and health declarations aren’t going away in the near and foreseeable future.
There are people out there who live with a fever everyday because of chronic medical conditions like autoimmune diseases, disautonomia, thyroid diseases and others.
I’m one of them. 
As the world goes full out in implementing temperature screening everywhere and flat-out denying entry to everyone with a fever, please remember that people like me do exist. 🙏🏻😭
