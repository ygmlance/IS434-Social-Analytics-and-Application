It’s almost time to exit the #CircuitBreaker! As most of us are getting ready to go back to our normal life, we would like you to take a few moments to look back at what we will remember as one of the greatest disruptions to our lives.

Together with @printdynamics.sg and @goevents.sg , we are making ‘My Circuit Breaker Time Capsule’ booklet as a token to reflect, cherish, and preserve your bittersweet memories during these challenging times. We are handing out limited amount of these booklets for free, so give us a DM or comment down below if you want a copy and we will send to you by mail or arrange for a pick up! Stay Safe!
