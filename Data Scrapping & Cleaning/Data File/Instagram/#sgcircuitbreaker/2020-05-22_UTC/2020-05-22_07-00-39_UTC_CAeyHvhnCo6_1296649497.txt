Following this week's announcement, we have decided to stick to our planned June dates for @tp_therapy Level 1 and 2 and take the live workshop to Zoom! 🙏🏼We know that these are difficult times for everyone and we want to help our students and the industry as much as we can: we have discounted the Level 1 & 2 Combo by an extra $100 to make it $500!!! 😃This is AMAZING value for money as you are getting not only the TWO live workshops, a total of 1.2 ACE CEC’s/1.1 NASM CEU's but also all the Trigger Point Tools and course manuals!
Please note that this special price is only available through Offline payment (PayNow + Bank Transfer ONLY no credit card payment) and that registrations will close on Sunday June 7th. 📆Dates + Times⏱

Level 1: Friday 19 June 2020
9am to 1pm
There will be short breaks throughout the session.

Level 2: Friday 26 June 2020
9am to 12 pm & 2pm - 5pm
Again, we will make sure to allow a few short breaks within those sessions. 👨🏻‍🏫Educator
