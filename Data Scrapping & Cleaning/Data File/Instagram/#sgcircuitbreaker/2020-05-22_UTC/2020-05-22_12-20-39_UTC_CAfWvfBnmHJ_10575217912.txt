He’s so informative you will never fail! Here’s how I made adapted mine. (I used the 9 egg whites recipe!)
✻
TIP: Do not grease your pan and rmb to let it cool upside down! (See >> on how to cool it)
•No cake flour? Check out my highlights on how to make it with AP flour. I used top flour cause it’s better for chiffon cakes!
•Sub corn oil for organic extra virgin coconut oil and it smelt so amazing
•I couldn’t find full fat coconut milk so I used low fat. Imo no diff to me
•I actually used about 15-20 pandan leaves and used 4tbsp pandan extract + 1/2 tbsp pandan paste
•Will defo cut sugar in the ‘yellow team’ ONLY, to about 50-60g instead of 100g
