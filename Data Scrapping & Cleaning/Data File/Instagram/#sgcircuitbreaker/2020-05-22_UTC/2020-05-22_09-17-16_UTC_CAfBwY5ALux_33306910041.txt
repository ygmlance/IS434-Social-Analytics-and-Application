On 17-Feb-2020, I bought these two books for our daughter to learn alphabets from a nearby book store (I miss visiting book shops and #publiclibraries by @publiclibrarySG). She would write 1-2 pages almost every night and has completed them today. We postponed the plan to send her to a nursery due to #covid19. Her big brother (our P1 son) was worried that she did not really recognize the words (only the visuals, i.e. she could not read yet) so while I was cooking our lunch, he wrote all the words in a single page to "test" his sister, especially she has not started any schooling. He is getting determined to teach his little sister daily, especially in this school holiday (I shared with him that I volunteered to mentor and teach while a student). I hope that they learn the spirit of #teamwork and the virtue of #patience. I pray that he applied the patience that he has learned from his #kindergartenTeachers and #primarySchoolTeachers (though #onlineLearning #homeBasedLearning are increasingly prevalent now, we still appreciate learning directly or face-to-face as technology could not convey 100% of genuine human interactions). He is also concerned of his P6 friends (school bus mates) who would be taking PSLE in 4 months time, especially a P6 prefect who shared his umbrella on 25-March-2020 (yes we remember because our son counted it as his daily gratitude). I assured him that P6 pupils @MOESingapore and #MOESingapore teachers would do their best. “#Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today.” – #ThichNhatHanh @thichnhathanhsangha | #ThankYouTeachers #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #TobaccoExposed #WorldNoTobaccoDay https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
