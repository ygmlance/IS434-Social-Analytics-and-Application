It’s been a strange period for us. Once in a blue moon, we get something like this thrown upon us. Something unexpected that exposes, uncovers and reveals. Masks are torn off and carpets are overturned. The good, the bad and the ugly. All out in the open. And we are forced to confront our fears, insecurities and imperfections head on. Times like these, I deal by retreating to my running shoes and mat. 
1. It isn’t always what it seems. Something upsets you but sometimes the cause is really something else. My knees hurt but it’s my hips that are weak. I get upset when he doesn’t eat/sleep as planned but it’s because I myself haven’t had enough food or rest. Lots of much heavier content but it’s the same concept really. 
We can choose to dig deeper, expose the underlying and try to tackle it once and for all. Or put on a band aid and pray it won’t resurface (oh but it will). 2.There are days that are more off than the rest. There isn’t always a reason. It’s just like that. 
My legs feel heavier on some runs. He sleeps better on some days. Thoughts flow better at work on days where you don’t have to work. 
Sometimes we get obsessed with finding the reason but often, the reason only appears when we stop hunting for it. 
3. Do more of what we love. Make time for it. Even five minutes may make a difference. If that’s really impossible, then try to find joy in what we do, which isn’t that challenging if we really put our mind to it. 
A new day. 
There is always hope in a new day.
