Challenge: “No fabrics! Only like wood and plastic and metal and stuff” from @jontan.co, thank you! 💝

Y’all… this was by far THE MOST DIFFICULT outfit for many and obvious reasons!! But SO FUN.
.
I used a cut up piece of cardboard (from my years in LASALLE having to create presentation boards) and an old hanger that I bent into a circle (don’t worry I bent it back). After I got it on my body it was really hard to manoeuvre myself into frame to shoot. I also couldn’t do many poses because cardboard is not the most flexible material, but I love the thigh high slit and the neckline. I added some pearl jewelry cuz I felt a little like Audrey Hepburn from Breakfast at Tiffany’s… if she was really sweaty and salvaged clothes from the dumpster? 😂
.
I actually broke a chain belt trying to secure the cardboard before I resorted to using the hanger!! 😖 I can fix it but I don’t have the parts right now so it’s just sitting in my accessories box… rip
