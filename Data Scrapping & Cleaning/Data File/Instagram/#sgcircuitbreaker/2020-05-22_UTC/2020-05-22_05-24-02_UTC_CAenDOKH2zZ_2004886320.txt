#sideplank - on bended knee and leg raise 💪🏻
.
If I had to do this weeks ago, I'd probably not make it; won't be able to balance, won't be able to support myself on my bended knee, let alone raise my leg. But weeks of building strength has allowed me to be able to manage this.
.
Sometimes, keeping yourself fit and strong is not about how you look (not everyone will achieve the lean look as fast as others) but seeing yourself being able to do challenging exercises/workout.
.
I can feel how I'm growing in strength day by day. Gone are the days of backache and muscle cramps. Even my knee is hurting lesser and lesser. With post circuit breaker opening in phases, won't be heading into the gym anytime soon, so gotta keep this up 👍🏻
