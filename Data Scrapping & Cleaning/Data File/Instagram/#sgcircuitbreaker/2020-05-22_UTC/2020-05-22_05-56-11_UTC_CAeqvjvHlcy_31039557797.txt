■ Hey guys! Here's a Core Complex for you today! 
Remember that the core isnt just the "6 pack abs"...
This complex will target your abdominis, hip flexors, posterior chain (glutes & lower back), as well as your core rotational musculature.
Check out the demo, try it out and let me know how it goes! And as usual, dont forget to warm up and cool down!
.
■ Core Complex
• Repeat AMRAP
- V Ups x 30s
- Glute Bridges x 30s
- Russian Twists x 30s
- Rest x 30s
*You may start with bodyweight, or add additional load (i.e. med ball, dumbbell, kettlebell, backpack etc.)
.
■ How? - Set timer to 30sec repeats (im using the GymNext Flex Timer App)
- Perform 3 exercises (30s each), followed by a 30s rest
- Repeat as many rounds as you can (aim for 4~6 Rounds)
- Stop when you can no longer hold good form for any of the exercise
