| Phonics at Home Tutorial |‚Å£
‚Å£
I have uploaded a simple walkthrough of teaching simple phonics - different phonics programmes, a quick look at some decodable readers, how I teach my child blending and segmenting etc. ‚Å£

Sorry, I know the video not perfect. Use a ear piece so you can hear the sounds better. I had to rush this out at night while my kids were sleeping. I was so afraid they wake up so I don't dare to use my teacher voice ü§£.‚Å£

Special thanks to those who have watched and feedbacked to me. I am really glad that the tutorial helps some parents out there. ‚Å£

Remember to invest more money on picture books instead of basal readers. And invest more time on reading picture books and conversing with your child, instead of teaching them phonics. The demonstration I showed in the video is simple to follow and nothing fanciful. Lesson should be 30mins or less a day. Phonics is essential but doesn't mean it should be the only focus in language.‚Å£
