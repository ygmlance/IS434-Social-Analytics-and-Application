Hardly our most popular dish, but actually one of the tastiest… The name "Udang Masak Tauyu" literally means “prawns stir-fried in dark soya sauce”, and here’s a dramatic depiction of that very process.

Any seafood enthusiast would know that you always cook prawns with the shells on - this is to maximise flavour and also the pleasure of (for lack of a better term) “sucking” the juices out of those prawn heads. Paired with the umami of the soya sauce. Mmmmm.

This process of the stir-fry also means the cooking time is down to a bare minimum - the secret to a tasty prawn is pretty simple. Don’t overcook it! That way you get that tantalizing crunch and also all those delicious juices sealed in.

If you have another tasty method of cooking prawns, we’d love to know. Tell us in the comments down below.
