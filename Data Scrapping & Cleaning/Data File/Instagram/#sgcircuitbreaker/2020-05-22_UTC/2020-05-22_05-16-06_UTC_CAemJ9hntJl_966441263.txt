My version char kuey teow, without bean sprouts, cockles and lard. Haha too healthy to taste like the hawker centre ones. Changed it up abit to 月光河粉(moonlight horfan) cos i realised my fried eggs disappeared into the noodles. Cooking at home not only trains your patience to prepare food, it allows u to appreciate the hawkers and hawker food outside, agree? Lol
