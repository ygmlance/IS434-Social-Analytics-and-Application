Often we only post photo of ourselves when we feel others will be "not judge" us. Because of we don't like the current body body, we will hide behind others or only photos with the body cropped off. ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜¤ Enough is enough. I decided to stop living a life based on other people's judgement on us. I feel if you want to get into better shape, the first step is to embrace your own body and accept that your current body shape and make a decision to get into the shape you want. Only when you are filled with positivity and gratitude in your mind, you will truely experience the magical and fun journey.

What people like to say, let them be. Know what you want and make it happen. Use your results to talk to people. ðŸ˜‰

I am grateful for my team. @agnes_tttt @lynnkang @rosrossss @jenicekoo We recently randomly started a 5% Challenge and winner gets to pick a task for other participants. Super excited.

If you are also working towards your next body. Share in the comment what do you feel is the biggest challenge for you?
