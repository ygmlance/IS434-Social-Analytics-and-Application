Looking forward to the end of Circuit Breaker on June 1? Here are some things you need to know.

As the Circuit Breaker draws to a close, our government has released a new set of measures, shedding some light to as to how our city will be reopening safely. 
There will be 3 phases for our reopening, which will take place over several months. Some measures in Phase 1 (>4weeks) include some businesses opening and a limited number of family visitors are allowed in households. Schools will open partially, with pre-schools and student care centers to fully resume. In Phase 2 (over a few months), we will see F&B dine-in resuming, and other service sectors also opening. Schools and other amenities will fully open. In Phase 3, Singapore will enter a ‘new normal’ as social, culture, religious and business gatherings resume with limited crowd sizes.
