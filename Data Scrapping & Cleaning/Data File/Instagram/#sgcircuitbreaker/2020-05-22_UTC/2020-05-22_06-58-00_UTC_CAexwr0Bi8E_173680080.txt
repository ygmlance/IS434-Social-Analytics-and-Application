Rookery is a café by day and gastropub by night located in Singapore CBD. Inspired by the Australian and American casual dining culture, Rookery presents a unique dining experience. During this period you could order their special menu online rookery.oddle.me or just type rookery.sg and it will bring you there. 
We have the opportunity to taste some of their signature dishes and cocktail.
Start with Australian Angus Steak, 200gm Angus Striploin Seared To Perfection |Beef Jus, only S$17.00
Angus have always been bred purely for the production of highest quality beef indicated by the smooth, close-grained texture, carnation red colour and finely marbled fat within the lean muscle. You can’t go wrong with this meat. At $17 it’s a bargain, comes with two sides.
Signature Cheeseburger, Juicy Australian Beef Patty | Lettuce | Tomato | BBQ Sauce | Brioche Bun, 2 sides, only S$14.00. The beef patty is good quality and remain soft and juicy, flavorful and tasty. The size is also reasonably large compare to some mini size burgers sold online.
Roasted Miso Glazed Salmon, 160g of Air-Flown Chilled Norwegian Salmon, two sides, only S$16.00. Now this is another worth recommending, goes very well with rice or potato. Quite a large piece too.
Bangers & Mash, Italian Pork Sausage | Chicken Cheese Sausage | Mashed Potato | Chicken Jus, only S$12.00. For those who like some quality sausage can get this dish, goes well with some ice cold beer.
They offered cocktail too and so we tried the Tokyo Martini, Choya Umeshu | Dry Vermouth | Vodka | Japanese Plum | Shiso Powder, only S$10.00. I wasn’t expecting much but was pleasantly surprise by the quality of this drink. Right combination that gives you the kick. You soon find that one is not enough.
