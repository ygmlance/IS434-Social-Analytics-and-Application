Save the energy because you already know,you will.That’s  just human nature as much as I wish it weren’t so .I stopped fighting a Long time ago the way the world actually was.In doing that I realise my time and energy was way better spend on things I can control.Firstly,how I react when it happens.Now that I can control I use that as a Super power which in case you were wondering ,you better believe I do😝 ⁣
