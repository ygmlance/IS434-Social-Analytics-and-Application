Today's self-check series features the beautiful wheel pose✨!⁠
⁠
Wheel pose is an intermediate backbend pose that energises you physically and 🧠 mentally. ⁠
⁠
This pose tones and lengthens body muscles💪, and increases flexibility in your hip joints and spine while opening up your chest and lungs🌬. ⁠
⁠
More importantly, focus on actively pressing your feet into the mat to lift, instead of placing emphasis on where your knees and toes are pointing.⁠
⁠
If you encounter compression in the lower back, shaky arms, and legs when you attempt this pose, practise the earlier stage of asana such as bridge pose or cobra series first 👍.⁠
⁠
When you can, don’t hesitate to add the wheel pose to your daily routine! ⁠
⁠
Regular practice of wheel pose raises your personal confidence level🥰, enhances physical and emotional stability - promoting a positive attitude towards life and challenges which lead to greater peace and serenity🍀.⁠
⁠
Remember our mantra, focus on how it feels🤗, not how it looks!⁠
