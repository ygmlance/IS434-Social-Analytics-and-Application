Return 3 of those unsuitable and heavy:
#markcrossgracebox
#markcrossuptown
#loewepostal

Made some losses with the volatility of USD which drop so much during the returns. But yeah if it doesn't suit and is heavy, it simply ain't suitable for use.

Shopbop has great customer service, ship fast using DHL Express, 4 business days from USA-Singapore.

Mark Cross has good customer service but slow Fedex International Economy shipping method, 6 business days from USA-Singapore (touches the weekends, add 2 more days wasted in between). Offers 25% additional discount on the Susanna that came with damages.

Proenza Schouler has useless customer service and sold me a defect bag with severely corroded screw for additional 10% discount with no choice since they could only offer that or a full refund (but I like the PS1 Micro!). DHL Express Shipping was the fastest among all, purchased on Fri, received on Mon from Italy-Singapore.

24S DHL Express ships fast 2-3 business days from Paris, Customer Service reply are pretty slow. Sold me a damage Loewe Postal bag which I refunded since is heavy too.

Matchesfashion has okay customer service where the reply came after parcel is shipped (thus useless), 3 business days DHL Shipping from UK-Singapore.
