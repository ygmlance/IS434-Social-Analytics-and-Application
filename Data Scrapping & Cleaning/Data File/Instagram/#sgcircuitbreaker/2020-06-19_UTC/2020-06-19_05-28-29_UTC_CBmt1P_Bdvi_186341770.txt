Chillax... It's TGIF!!! And a great news to all Singaporeans. We are official entering phrase 2 of opening up our economy. ♥️👍🏻
.
While it's still a way to go to full recovery and obviously it's still not the time for party mode, but it's worth celebrating the mood. 😍👍🏻
.
Since is a happy day, randomly share two secrets with everyone today... 🤫👌🏻🤣
.
1) During the circuit breaker lockdown, for the past 2.5 months, I dont have to wash my pants at all! Only wear the top shirt for online classes, hence I save a lot of water and detergent. 🤣🤣🤣
.
2) During this photoshoot at @thetaarasmalaysia with @berjayahotelsresorts I didnt on that tap at all. It was a photoshoot! Haha sad me didnt have the time to enjoy the bath... I was there for an hour, cold and hungry... 🥺
.
Just for laugh... enjoy the weekend & fathers day. .
Remember to take precautions and stay safe! ♥️👍🏻
