It’s finally here. The greatest weekend all rolled into one. Today we open our doors for the first time in almost 3 months, to celebrate the first day of Phase 2 !

But don’t forget, it’s Father’s Day this coming Sunday. We’re back to dine in operations: 4pm to 10.30pm daily, and we’re also doing takeaways/deliveries from 12nn onwards.

For those who haven’t heard, we’re having a special Father’s Day Set box set of grilled meats.

And here’s what you get:

Ayam Panggang - a whole chicken marinated with spices and grilled to perfection with a kicap manis glaze.

Char Siu Melaka - a generous cut of pork belly slow cooked with our very own original gula Melaka marinate.

Naughty BBQ Ribs - a full slab of baby back ribs flame grilled with our signature rich and spicy ’naughty’ sauce.

Accompanied by - Coconut Glutinous Rice | Pineapple Salad | Burnt Chilli

All for $65nett with islandwide delivery included. This box is available until 21 June. We will be taking last orders on 20 June at 12pm. These things tend to go fast, so book early to avoid disappointment !

We’re open everyday for lunch and dinner, and we offer FREE ISLANDWIDE DELIVERY for orders $50 and above. Link in bio.
