Here's three ways to kick yourself back into action by creating momentum:⁣⁣⁠
⁣⁣⁠
𝟏.  𝐏𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 ✅⁠
Most of us tend to be better at getting things done for others than ourselves. If that's you, then get an accountability partner, a business bestie, or make a public announcement of your goal. Put purposeful accountability in place so you have to get it done.⁣⁣⁠
⁣⁣⁠
𝟐. 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐬⁣⁣ ✅⁠
Be specific and strict with the time frame you have to complete your goals and mini-goals for the day. The more specific you are, the higher the chances of completing it. No, "it takes a few hours' doesn't make the cut here!⁣⁣⁠
⁣⁣⁠
𝟑. 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐤 𝐢𝐭 𝐃𝐎𝗪𝐍!⁣⁣ ✅⁠
Some of us have big, fantabulous goals. But these goals can sometime feel too grand and big to achieve in one day, resulting in defeatism. Chunk your big goal down into mini milestones, and chunk it down further! Every step you take towards your goal MATTERS and you should allow yourself to feel proud for taking steps!⁣⁣⁠
