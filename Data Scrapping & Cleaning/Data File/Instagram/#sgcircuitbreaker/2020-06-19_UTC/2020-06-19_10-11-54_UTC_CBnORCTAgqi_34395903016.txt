Exiting phrase 1 and entering phrase 2 with new chapters and beginnings which marks the start of a new adventure to embark on. Its time to broaden out horizons and appreciate the work mother nature has done for us. For those undergoing stress due to exams, work or losses from the current situation, I hope that you would be able to remind yourself 
that there is a sliver lining to everything. Dont worry, we are all in this together, we will finish this well as a country. #phrase2 #sgcircuitbreaker #nature
