How did you spend the first day of phase 2? Hope everyone enjoyed that little bit of extra freedom today and get to visit family or friends we haven't seen in a while! Please do still stay safe and don't rush out to crowded places.. 😜
Sending everyone some love with this dreamy pink bouquet from sometime back. ❤
