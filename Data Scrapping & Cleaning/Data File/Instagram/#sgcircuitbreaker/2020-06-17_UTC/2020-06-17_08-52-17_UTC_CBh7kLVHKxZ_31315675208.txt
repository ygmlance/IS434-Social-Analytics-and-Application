Another Work-from-home day. Finally, we are moving into phrase 2 of reopening more businesses after the Circuit breaker. Everyone is excited so am I. I am really happy for all the business owners who have come this far in the fight to survive during this tough situation. The business will not be the same again as most of us have to cut our capacity in half. However, we have to keep the business going. There is light at the end of the tunnel.
