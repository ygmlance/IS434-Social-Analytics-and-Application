This circuit breaker lockdown teaches me that... we dont always need a plan, at times we just need to breathe, trust, let go and see what happens! 😍👍🏻

2.5 months of lockdown at home, I felt it's a learning journey. It changed me a little and let me appreciate even simpler things in life. E.g. Staying at home with family, seeing your siblings and friends. ♥️👍🏻
.
While we always learn dont take things for granted, I'm treasuring the quality time, also yearning the time to spend with siblings and buddies. 🥰👍🏻

It's been a while... ♥️👍🏻
