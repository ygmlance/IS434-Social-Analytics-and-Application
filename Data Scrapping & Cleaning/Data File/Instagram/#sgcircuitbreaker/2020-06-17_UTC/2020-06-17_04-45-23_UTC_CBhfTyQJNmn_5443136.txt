2 more days to Phase 2 of the #sgcircuitbreaker reopening of the economy, and I'm sure everyone is super excited about being able to dine out again after so long! WoOHOO!!! 😋
.
Throwback to the soul food I had at @spicythaithaicafe months ago, looking forward to munch on freshly cooked Lala and Fried Kang Kong really soon! 🥬🇹🇭 I'm still wary of the Rona virus though, so I'll be taking a cautious step when it comes to dining out and resuming gym activities... We're not out of the clear yet, people!!! Please be safe and wear your masks, avoiding crowded places as much as possible okayyyyy??? 😷✌🏻
.
Side note: I'm dying for Korean BBQ, but that's gonna have to wait a bit more... 😩
