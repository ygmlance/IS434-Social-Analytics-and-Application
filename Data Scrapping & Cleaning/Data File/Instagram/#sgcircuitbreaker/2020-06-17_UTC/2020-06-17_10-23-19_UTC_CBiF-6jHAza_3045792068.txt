Dear Healthcare Heroes, ⁣
⁣
Thank you for having our backs over the past few months – it’s time we help to take care of yours! We will be providing free chiropractic check-ups and adjustments from now until the end of July 2020. ⁣
⁣
Many of our members are healthcare workers, and common ailments that we can help with include headaches as well as neck and back pains from prolonged hours of work while fighting the pandemic. ⁣

We are located at Novena Specialist Center, Westgate Tower, and Harbourfront Tower, within walking distance of many major hospitals and clinics. ⁣X-rays are separately chargeable if needed. ⁣
