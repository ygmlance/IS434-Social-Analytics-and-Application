i think the phase 2 announcement was a sigh of relief for us all in at least one way or another,, while i'm really excited to be able to see friends (and play ball...... it's been a long long long while man), i'm kiinda a little sad because i think it's v rare to be able to stay home with the whole family & all i will really miss everyone when phase 2 begins & people start going back to work and i get caught up in my own uni life again... as much as it was frustrating to stay home with the same 3 people for 2.5 months straight, it made me truly appreciate the important things in life & all that shit AHAHAHAH mixed feelings are real :") but ok def excited to go ball again omg BUT don't go overboard @ everyone,,, take care & stay safe!!! ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª
