WARNING: SWIPE LEFT TO SEE HOW TENDER THIS BEEF IS.

Although it’s only been around for a week, we’ve already received quite a few orders for our Grilled USDA Angus Beef Short Rib, and we must say the feedback has been very encouraging…

We deliberately priced it at an attractive $48 so that our customers would have less of a barrier to ordering it. In short, we want everyone to try this damn cut of beef !

If you can’t finish it in one sitting, guess what? Pick it up later, heat it up and it’s just as good ! Of course, most of us here won’t have that problem at all.

We’re serving this in our restaurant for dine-in from 19 June onwards, and yes, we’re still delivering islandwide for free with orders $50 and above. Link in bio.
