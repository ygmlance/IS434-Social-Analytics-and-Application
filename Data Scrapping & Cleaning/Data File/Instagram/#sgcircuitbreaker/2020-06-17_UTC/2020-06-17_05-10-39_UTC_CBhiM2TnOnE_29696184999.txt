Kombucha typically has a pH of around 2.5-3.5 during bottling. We conduct pH testings to ensure that they are within the acceptable range before bottling! ðŸ˜‹

The low pH acts as a self preserving element that omits the requirement of any preservatives used to prevent unwanted food-borne bacteria from growing in the beverage! ðŸ¦  ðŸ§«
.
During fermentation, similar to fermenting beer, yeast and bacteria work together to complete the process. SCOBYs (Symbiotic Colony Of Bacteria & Yeast) generally produce acetic acid, regardless of the strains present which contributes to the low pH and itâ€™s health benefits! ðŸ’ŠðŸ§¬
.
Some of them include, reducing inflammation, lowering blood pressure and keeping low blood sugar level spikes throughout the day!

They work hand in hand with the healthy probiotics in Kombucha to make this drink a SUPERFOOD alternative to traditionally sweetened beverages!ðŸ›¡
