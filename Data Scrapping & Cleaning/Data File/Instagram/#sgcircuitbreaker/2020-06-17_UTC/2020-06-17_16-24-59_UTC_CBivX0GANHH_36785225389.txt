🍻🍻Let’s drink to the Phase 2 of Singapore’s reopening in less than 24 hours‼️🍻

Can’t wait to have my favourite Vietnamese pho! Yes, dine in and physical retail shops will finally be opened, with restrictions for the safety of all, which include mask wearing 😷and safe distancing.

Stay safe, everyone! Stay vigilant!🙏🙏
Let’s work together and look forward to the smooth transition to Phase 3, the “ new normal”!

We can do it together‼️ 👍🏻💪🏻🙏
