Chicken Teriyaki and Zaru Soba (swipe right)
.
This was lunch from few days ago. Second attempt on making teriyaki without ready sauce. Subtituted mirin (jap sweet rice wine) with chinese rice wine but added more sugar so that I can get enough sweetness and glaze on the chicken. Thank goodness it turned out quite nice with the chicken still succulent.
.
Zaru soba is great, cheap, and easy. I recommend buy it the noodles and noodle sauce from daiso.
