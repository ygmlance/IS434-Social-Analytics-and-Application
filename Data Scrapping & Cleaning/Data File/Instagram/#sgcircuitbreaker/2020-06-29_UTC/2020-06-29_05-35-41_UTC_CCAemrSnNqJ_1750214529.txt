Luncheon meat buns with @sulyntan soft milk bun as the base into 9 buns, topped with eggwash. Meat to bread ratio can be improved, ie make more buns with the same amount of dough.

This dough is forgiving and with practice, I was able to turn this around in 3.5 hours. Yay to homemade bakery style buns!
