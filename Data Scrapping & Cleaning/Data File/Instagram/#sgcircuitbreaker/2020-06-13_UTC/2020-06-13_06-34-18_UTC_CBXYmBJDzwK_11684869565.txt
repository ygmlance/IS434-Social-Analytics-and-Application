We arrived in Singapore 5 months ago on New Year’s Eve, got too busy looking for a new home and getting the big sister ready for her new school while also trying to not catch this (then) novel virus... then the city went into lockdown (which it calls “circuit-breaker). This was one of our only photos outside our serviced apartment. It was crowded that day in the old Chinatown as everyone was preparing for the lunar new year. Big crowd, no masks and no social distancing in restaurants - this feels so long ago. Right now all we want is to explore this city-state, meet friends old and new and maybe have other people in our photos (?), to not wear a mask anymore especially in this heat and humidity and constantly slathering our hands with hand sanitizers (and not freak out about germs we could be bringing with us because naturally we all live in symbiosis with other organisms). Singapore might fully open by month’s end and that’s one great news as we close the first quarter of this very strange, very interesting, very uncertain, but very wonderful, lessons-and-reforms full year. We’re truly excited and regardless how hard this year has been so far my heart is full of gratitude, optimism and eagerness and I hope  you all feel the same way too. #sgcircuitbreaker
