Casual and heart-to-heart talk at @ourhappykopitiam Episode 14 on 13 June, sharing about how we can do more to help those in need especially the seniors in the area of healthcare and digitalisation, support and assistance for Singaporeans during this #COVID19 period. Glad to have with us Minister @ng.chee.meng , @lei.wang and @anderenechoo ! 😊❤️
