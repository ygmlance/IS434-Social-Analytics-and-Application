this circuit breaker / phase 1 (or as i like to call it "non-lockdown lockdown") has vastly increased my screen-time. not like it wasn't high before. but also not like it was hard to adapt. that's the scary part.

because of this, it made me more motivated to dedicate time off-screen. i have started reading books again (yay!) i have also started sewing again ğŸ¥³

everyone in the house has this exact same mask so i decided to make mine more identifiable. freestyle stitches inspired by the wildflowers we see on the roadside (because we stopped cutting the grass lol) ğŸŒ¼ğŸŒ¼ğŸŒ¼ #

and with this, i also received the highest praise you can ever get from an asian parent: "not bad."
