On her way to Timbre for some roasted duck pizza 😛 🍕 They had a plan - it was a friend's birthday, and they had passed a couple of crimsom red roses to the helpful staff at the counter. The waiters trailed in at the end of their meal with a cake, and one by one, they handed each rose over to her dear friend as she giggled with surprise. (Thanks, sporting waiters for the fond memory!)
