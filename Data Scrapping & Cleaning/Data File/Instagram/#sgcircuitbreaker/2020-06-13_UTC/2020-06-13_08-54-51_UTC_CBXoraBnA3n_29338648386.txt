Next on the menu is homemade JAPCHAE! {swipe right for more details and video} I love chewy foods, and japchae’s on the list!!😍 Ive went on a japchae search in SG, but it’s hard to find good & cheap ones :’) Over circuit breaker period, I’ve been making this over and over again to curb craves + improve the taste of the noodles~

I’m selling homemade japchae which will be cooked just before collection! The portions are for 2 (a hungry me can finish one), and 4~ Feel free to satisfy ur japchae craves with your fam! ☺️ Japchae can be kept for about 2 days refrigerated, simply heat it up to enjoy it hot.

If you don’t know what Japchae is, it’s Korean stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables 😊 My japchae is vegetarian (u can add your own meat to it). This japchae is chewy, not overly saucey, and mixed with softened & flavourful vegetables, topped with sesame seeds✨

Add ons are available too! DM for orders, enquiries and special requests.
