Hello Saturday! 😎⁠
⁠
Time to rise and shine and start the day with some healthy smoothie and exercises! ⁠
⁠
Do you know that eating and exercise goes hand in hand? Many people actually exercise on an empty stomach for fear of getting side stitches, but not eating before you exercise is like driving a car without fuel 🚗⁠
⁠
The most important part is picking the right kind of food to munch on before your exercise and the right timing. ⁠
⁠
🍴 Eat breakfast at least one hour before you exercise ⁠
🍴 Good breakfast options are whole-grain cereals or bread,⁠
low-fat milk, juice, banana, yogurt⁠
🍴 Keep you portions small ⁠
🍴 If your workout is longer than 60 minutes, you may benefit by including a carbohydrate-rich food or beverage during the workout⁠
🍴 To help your muscles recover, eat a meal with both carbohydrates and protein within two hours of your exercise session⁠
⁠
⁠
So it's important to plan your meals with your exercise sessions to make the best of your workout! ⁠
