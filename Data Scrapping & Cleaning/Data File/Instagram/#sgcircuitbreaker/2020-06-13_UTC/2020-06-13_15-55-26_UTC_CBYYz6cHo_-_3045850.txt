We are finally ready to share our luxurious silk face mask, handcrafted from 100% silk⁣
⁣
This was created because I experience constant outbreaks on my lower face and jawline from wearing surgical masks ⁣
⁣
Silk is the finest in the market and more refined ⁣
Thus lightweight, breathable and gentle on our skin ⁣
⁣
It’s 100% natural, odorless and hypo-allergenic ⁣
Reduces possibilities of an allergic reaction ⁣
⁣
Impeccably handmade to perfection ⁣
- slot for filter⁣
- adjustable ear loops ⁣
- adheres well to face contour ⁣
- recommended for acne-prone or sensitive skin
