𝘛𝘳𝘪𝘱𝘭𝘦 𝘊𝘰𝘤𝘰 𝘍𝘶𝘥𝘨𝘺 𝘉𝘳𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘪𝘦 - a paradise for coco lovers. Recipe & fudgy video @gentlemans_cooking ⁣

This is a perfect timing to bake a birthday cake and to celebrate post COVID phase 1. For this cake, I could finally utilize my expiring-soon Valrhona cocoa powder 🤭 for the batter and layer in between with Whittakers 64% Samoan cocoa chocolate bar and Lindt Excellence extra creamy milk chocolate bar. During the whole baking process, I was watching out for cracks on the surface seen in the photos but that did not happen until I lifted the cake off the baking pan for cutting! Oh, I See, that’s how the earthquake cracks are formed!⁣
