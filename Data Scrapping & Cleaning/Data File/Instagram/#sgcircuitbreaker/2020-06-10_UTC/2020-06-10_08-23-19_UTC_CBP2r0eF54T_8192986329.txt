It's a popular #mumbaistreetfood prepared using boiled dried green peas.Usal Pav doesn't require an elaborate preparation like Misal..
Overnight soaked & boiled dried green peas are cooked with coconut,onion and tomatoes & seasoned with goda masala & chilli powder..
🔷️Top it up with onion ,fresh coriander,a dash of lime & Sev...Pair it up with Pav/bun.. it makes a complete meal..
