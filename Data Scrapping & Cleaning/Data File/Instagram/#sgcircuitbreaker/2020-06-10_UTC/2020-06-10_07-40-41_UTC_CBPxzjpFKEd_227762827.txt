Eucalyptus essential oil is often used to reduce the presence of bacterial, fungal, or viruses. This essential oil can help with minor pain and inflammation management, and ease unwanted muscle spasms.
Use in a steaming bowl of hot water 2-3 times a day as a preventative measure, at the first sign of a cold or flu.
Used in a diffuser to help purify the air when others are sick with the cold or flu to help minimize the spread of illness.
Dilute with carrier oil to help revitalize the skin and tired muscles.
