@jiggerandponysg presents fresh interpretations of classic cocktails, with its signature warm, convivial hospitality. Their 8th anniversary cocktail features a base of Havana Club 7yo Rum with delicate jasmine liqueur and a touch of sweetness with Okinawan sugar. The bottle also has an inner coating of beeswax that gives the cocktail a slight floral note. Letâ€™s continue to support our eateries in Singapore through this difficult time by ordering via direct islandwide delivery.
