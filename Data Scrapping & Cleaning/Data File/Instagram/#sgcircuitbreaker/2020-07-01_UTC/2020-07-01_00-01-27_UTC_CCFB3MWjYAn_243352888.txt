Anybody else feel that the first six months of the year snuck up on us, threw a party we didn't want and has now left us to clear up the mess? 🤔⁠
.⁠
🎉 A friend shared that 2020 was supposed to be a lucky year because of it's repeated number (the next one is 2121 in 101 years time, so not many of us are gonna be around for that) 🍀 Plus, its an even number and the start of a new decade + zodiac cycle, so 2020 had a lot going for it! 🐁⁠
.
Buttttt alas, you guys know how that's turned out so far 😝
.
2020 is not wasted though as per a post that's been circulating reminds⁠

💭 I think of 2020 H1 as the time when I've practice my crisis management dexterity, tried out many new things for my PositiveLeePeilin platform on the front and back end, and realised that an extrovert can love staying at home too 🏡⁠
.⁠
👫 Some of my relationships have evolved and even strengthened, when there is no food to detract from conversations 🛁  I'm sadly resigned to the fact that I still get pimples, even without makeup and outside dust 💄 Oh, and I am capable of eating my weight in potato chips, as long as there's a good Netflix series on 📺⁠
.⁠
😂 I also know now for fact that I sorely lack talent and interest in cooking, gardening and putting on false eyelashes 🍳👨🏼‍🌾👁️⁠

What has been your a-ha realistion these 6 months? 😅 Do share them in the comments, so we create a wave of satisfaction to start the next half year!⁠ 🤗⁠
