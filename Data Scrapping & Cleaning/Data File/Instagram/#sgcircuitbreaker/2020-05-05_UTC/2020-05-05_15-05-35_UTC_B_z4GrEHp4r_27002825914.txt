😻SHERMS COOKS: TRUFFLE FRIES AND SOUS VIDE SALMON
-
Carbs➡️For once not bread 😜 I have a russet potato cut up into strips and then oven-roasted and tossed in truffle oil. My attempt at truffle fries werent successful as the potatoes weren't crispy and stuck to the aluminum foil lining the pan! The 🥔 flavor is awesome though, definitely will keep working on them.

Protein➡️The most beautiful slab of Tasmanian salmon which I bought 'reduced to clear'. It includes part of the salmon belly, which is basically the most melt in your mouth part of the fish. And it flaked perfectly. It was so good.
-
Veggies➡️Roasted asparagus yumz 😋 I've grown quite fond of this strange, very un-Asian vegetable.

DESSERT (swipe!) ➡️I had a chocolate brownie and a sticky date pudding courtesy of @thelokalsingapore ❤️ Added some Waitrose vanilla ice cream (which tasted really good, "not fake vanilla" according to my dining partner) and some giant strawberries. The sticky date pudding comes with this awesome gooey, rich caramel sauce and the brownie is dense and super rich and chocolatey. 🍫 Goodness gracious its good.
