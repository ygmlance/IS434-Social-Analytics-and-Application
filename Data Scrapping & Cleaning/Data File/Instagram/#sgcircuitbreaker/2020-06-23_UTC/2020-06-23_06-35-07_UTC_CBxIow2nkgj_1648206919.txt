When the CB began suddenly in April, everyone was taken by surprise. We went into emergency gear, and rolled out the collaboration with Spice Peranakan, serving Nonya cuisine, which received lots of support from our regulars, friends and family.

Almost 3 months on, we have grown fond of all these local delights, but it’s time to say goodbye. With the beginning of Phase 2 and the opening of dine-in, the time has come to return to our roots - we will be welcoming back the burgers and finger food, and leaving the Peranakan menu behind.

We want to say Thank You again to all who have given their support. It truly has helped us get through the toughest times. Now we look ahead to better times.

As part of the journey with Spice Peranakan, we will also be featuring a grilled meat section, wholly inspired by local spices and tradition. We begin with 4 items, but will be adding more along the way. This new menu is available with both dine-in and delivery.
