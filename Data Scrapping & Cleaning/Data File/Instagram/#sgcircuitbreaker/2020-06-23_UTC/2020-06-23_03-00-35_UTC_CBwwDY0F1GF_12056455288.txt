⁣In case you missed it, that was the entire foundation of personal finance in less than 10 words:⁣⁠
⁣⁠
Spend less than you earn and invest the difference.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
Of course there’s three parts to it: Spend less, earn more, and invest.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
You should get really good at all three.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
Spending less reminds you that there is more to life than consumerism. It also protects you from risk, since a cheaper lifestyle is easier to fund.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
Earning more gives you confidence in your own ability to provide value. It also sets you up for future success since along the way you pick up useful knowledge and skills.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
Investing lets your money work for you.⁣⁠
