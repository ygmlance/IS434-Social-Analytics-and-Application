We can’t choose ! Spicy or cheesy ?

As you all know know, phase 2 has started, along with the re-opening of restaurant dine-in.

To welcome that back, we are bringing back our regular fare, with some of our crowd pleasers.

Here’s two types of popcorn chicken:

SPICY POPCORN CHICKEN | $10
Crispy chunks of chicken, bulldog sauce, kewpie mayo.

CHEEZY POPPERS | $12
Fried popcorn chicken, cheddar cheese sauce, spring onions, pickled jalapenōs

Choose your favourite, or just have BOTH. These champions are available for both dine-in and delivery.
