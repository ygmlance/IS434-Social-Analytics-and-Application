Muffins for my chocolate-loving father and a loaf for my bread-loving husband.
.
#throwback to Sunday when we celebrated these two amazing men in our lives! My father influenced most of who I am today, and my husband supports my every dream. Both, so different in personality, nurture my heart in their own loving ways.
.
Now, back to these bakes...
.
🍞 The bread turned out soft and fragrant but I think the muffins impressed me more! I didn’t expect it to turn out so tasty - crusty top with a moist centre. I cut down the sugar by 50% and added some ground peanuts as toppings - this upped the texture game and is a total delight for the palate. Even my savory tooth mum gave the muffins two thumbs up!

Would you like the recipe? Both are from @zoebakeforhappykids and I got them up in my bio. I’ll keep them there till Jul.
.
🤩 Have fun!
.
Whether you celebrated Father’s Day or not, I hope you had a well-rested weekend!
.
💕 Sending all the love from our family to yours.
