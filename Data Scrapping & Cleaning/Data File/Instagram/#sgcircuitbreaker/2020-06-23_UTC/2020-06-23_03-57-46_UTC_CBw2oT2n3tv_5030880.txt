After much hesitation, this lil one is back to school !â €
â €
Kyan has been asking when he can go back to school ! And when he found out his classmate is back to school, he asked why xxx go back to school le ah ?! Why i nv go ?! Briefed him on what is expected of him in class on hygiene level, mask wearing and tested him how to keep his mask and he showed it to me that he can do the necesary self protection himself well.â €
â €
ðŸŒŸ He told me : Covid 19 ABC ! Covid 19 we will beat ! ðŸŒŸ â €
â €
M glad that #Myfirstskool has taken the precaution measures well, reinforcing the #socialdistancing the kids need to maintain even in class. All kids are spaced out during curriculum activities and all are so well behaved ! Thank you teachers and school edu staffs for the constant updates in school portal ðŸ˜€â €
