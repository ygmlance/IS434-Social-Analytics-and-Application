After having spent almost 2 months everyday from morning till he sleptðŸ˜´, mummy is getting nervous and having separation anxiety! ðŸ˜­

Nacen will be starting school tomorrow! Mummy will miss the little joy so much! ðŸ˜¥

These 2 months of bonding is indeed memorable and rare. It's impossible to ever have this much time to slow down, have longer breakfast and lunch, to spend so much time together with your loved ones and to have work life balance.

There's no stress to stick to the ðŸ•˜9-6ðŸ•• office hours. And with Nacen at home, I can see how he's doing and keep track of his emotions better.

Sometimes I toy with the idea of home schooling so I can get to know him better.

I also do wish Singapore pace could be slower so we can have time to appreciate the surroundings, appreciate what we have and feel blessed, even with the simplest thing in life, and not to take things for granted.

Stay strong, stay safe everyone, for our family and loved ones.
