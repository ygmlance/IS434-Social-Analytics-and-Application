Doesn’t 2020 feel like we’re living in an alternate reality? Took a break from social media the past couple of days to listen to my surroundings and to also just soak in moments with these two as we slowly resume to normalcy and before our normal schedules take over our home life again. Two months of staying at home and having limited freedom had both been tough and easy and especially, memorable. I know it wasn’t the best of times, but very thankful to have more quality time with my children and my husband. It taught us so much and we have so much plans to look forward to - not just travels, but also changes we’re making to continue living fuller, slowly and consciously. #ourcandidlife #momlife #sgcircuitbreaker #delightsintheordinary #capturethemoments #slowlivingrevolution
