Dinner of ribs from @morganfieldssingapore last night and it was so gooood! I'm not doing justice to the food with this photo. I was too hungry from the smell of the food and didn't want to take too long trying to get a good pic and let the food turn cold. The food arrived warm, the meat was tender and fell off the bones, the mac and cheese was not too cheesy and very palatable, fries were not too hard (unlike many other orders) and the corn muffins made a nice dessert. Sausages, corn and salad were good too. 
We ordered the family meal for 4 pax plus one baby ribs and there was more than enough to feed at least 7 of us. It was a little pricey but do consider giving them a try! You won't regret it ðŸ˜‹
