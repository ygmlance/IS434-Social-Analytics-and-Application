😻SHERMS ASSEMBLES: SASHIMI BRUNCH
Yesterday I made a late night trip to my favorite gelato place in the whole world (@trattorialuccas at Robertson Quay sells the most amazingggg gelato, try their salty peanut, gianduia or pistachio flavors!) and decided to make a detour to the Don Don Donki at Clarke Quay. The spoils from that trip were today's brunch. And oh boy did I enjoy every bite.

Protein➡️That is an entire 200g slab of glorious salmon belly. It just melted in my mouth. I topped it with some ikura. Oh my, I am so addicted, that silky smooth fish with the saltiness of the ikura. I also have 3 fat scallops which were super satisfying and balanced out the fattiness of the fish.

Veggies➡️I have kimchi (I don't know how I got possessed to buy a huge 800g jar online and I am like, a third of the way through it already 😂) and some chuka wakame (seaweed salad). I love this ginger when I'm eating sashimi, it's vinegary acidity cuts through the fatty fish. I also had some homemade miso soup with more seaweed.

Carbs➡️Not in pic, but it was a warm and fluffy @kausmosg Oregano Milk bun. For once, the carb was totally overshadowed by how glorious that fish was 😅
