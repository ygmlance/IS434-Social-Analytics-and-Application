So I made this Taiwan delicacy for the kids. Braised meat and eggs in Chinese we call it the ”卤肉饭” it’s a dish from Taiwan. This dish goes perfectly with steam jasmine white rice!! Yummy and Savoury ! #卤肉饭 #taiwandishes #homecooking #cookingforkids #cookingforfamily #igsg #foodstagram #foodsofinstagram #sgcircuitbreaker #evescook #braisedmeat
