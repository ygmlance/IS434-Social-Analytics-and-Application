𝑷𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆
If a string is in a knot,
Patience will untie it.
Patience can do many things—
Did you ever try it?

If it was sold at any shop
I should like to buy it.
But you and I must find our own—
No other can supply it.
― Anna M. Pratt

We’d love to open our door and see you again. It’s been a while since we’ve had a chance to see the happy faces a new book can bring. But it’s important to stay safe at home in these times. So let’s dig deep for our patience and wait for these storm-filled days to pass.
