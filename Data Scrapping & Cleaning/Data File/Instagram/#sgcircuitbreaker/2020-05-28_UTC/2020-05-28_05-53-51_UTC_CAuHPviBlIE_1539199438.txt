ü§îHawker or Fitness,,,,
You want my truth? NEITHER! When I look at the permanent time frame. I've always known very clearly what im going for in life. It is the COMMON denominator between the both, hawker and fitness. The determination and endurance to work through 12hrs a day. And still be able to smile at you. The consistency to stick to boring routines daily to just to build a physique that could be lost in a simple fall, down the stairs... It is The FIGHT üî• 
It is the COURAGE üî•
It is the ability to SHINE when all seem so dark.
As an occupation,I dont know what to call/name it. I just know I need to work towards a day your kids tell you 'wa this uncle so dumb no talent still can make it, I also can!' My life would be complete le. Till then I won't be stopping.
.
Fitness is more than just health to me. It is my life philosophy; to get from point A to B in life. Time n effort is required. Fitness also brought me all the amazing brothers that invested in my vision b4 but failed big time. I know many of you started hating life, became dull and spiteful.
I owe it to you, it is my RESPONSIBILITY to shine so bright that your clouds of doubt have no choice but to dissipate. My mission is to be more than your inspiration, I'm going to be your IGNITOR!üí•MAKING YOU BELIEVE LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,AGAIN!

Lastly, huge thank you Ilsa and @8dayssg @8days_eat for such an amazing writeup!! ‚ù§
