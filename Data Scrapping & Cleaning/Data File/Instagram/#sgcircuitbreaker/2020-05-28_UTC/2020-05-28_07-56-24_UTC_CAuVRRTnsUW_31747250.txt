Butter chicken biryani ($3.90) with fragrant basmati rice from 7-11.
.
I have seen a number of people on IG trying this with positive feedback so I decided to give it a try as well.
.
Normally, I wouldn’t eat such microwave meals as I’d rather eat fresh ration however, I must say I am impressed by the flavors of this biryani.
.
The butter chicken doesn’t have the ‘frozen’ smell and in fact, tasted rather fresh. The curry is quite authentic and goes well with the basmati rice.
.
As for the brown sugar milk tea, it wasn’t too sweet so it’s good but it comes with konjac jelly instead of the usual pearls so I didn’t like it.
