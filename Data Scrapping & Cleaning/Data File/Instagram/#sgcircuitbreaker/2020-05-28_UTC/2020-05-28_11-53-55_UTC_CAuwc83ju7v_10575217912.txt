Method:
‚Ä¢In a food processor, pulse flour, cold butter and salt until combined. Add water a little at a time until it forms a dough. (You might not use the whole 1/2 cup water)
‚Ä¢Separate dough into two, flatten into discs and cling wrap. Place in the fridge until firm
‚Ä¢Peel, core and slice apples thinly. Add sugars, cinnamon and lemon juice. Mix well. Put apples in a sieve and place a bowl beneath to let the apples macerate. Refrigerate for 1.5 hours
‚Ä¢In a pot, pour in the liquid from the macerated apples. Over low heat, slowly whisk in corn flour and water. Stir continuously until sauce thickens and let it cool. Pour sauce back into bowl of apple slices
‚Ä¢Take dough 1 from the fridge, flatten it and roll it out to drape over the bottom of your pie tin. Fill up with apple slices
‚Ä¢Take dough 2 from fridge repeat and place on top of the apples. Gently pinch both top and bottom pastry to seal them and decorate your pie
‚Ä¢If your pie is not lattice styled, remember to cut slits in your pie using a knife
‚Ä¢Brush egg wash over the whole pie and bake at 200deg for 40-45mins until golden brown. Serve with ice cream!
