@candlenutsg prides themselves in serving inspired dishes with authentic Peranakan flavours. One of their classics is the Yeye Chicken Curry, a timeless recipe passed down from generations. It's a rich, white coconut curry cooked with tender Toh Thye San chicken, kaffir lime leaf and green banana. Slightly creamy, incredibly addictive - perfect for a rainy day. Try it for yourself today! Letâ€™s continue to support our eateries in Singapore through this difficult time by ordering via direct islandwide delivery.
