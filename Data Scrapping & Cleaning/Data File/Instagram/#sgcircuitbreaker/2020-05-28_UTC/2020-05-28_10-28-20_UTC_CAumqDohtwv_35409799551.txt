Stay calm
Circuit breaker is almost over but the road to full recovery is still long. Gentle reminder to stay calm in the midst of ever changing environment. 
How are you handling the CB and what are you looking forward to? For me, I'm looking forward to the day I have have meals with my family and friends again, exchanging stories and sharing laughters. Stay strong and stay calm folks!
