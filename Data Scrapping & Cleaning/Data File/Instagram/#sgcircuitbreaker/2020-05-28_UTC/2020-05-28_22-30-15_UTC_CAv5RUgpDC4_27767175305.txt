Lockdown, iso, circuit-breaker, quarantine - whatever you call it, it's given us all quite a bit of thinking time over these past few months, hasn't it? Taking us away from our day to day mania, rushing everywhere, constantly consuming - I hope it's given people a chance to check in as to what's really important. I feel really hopeful that significant positive changes can come out of it. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My post-lockdown hope is that we have an awakening of sorts, moving away from a world so focused on consumption and material things and towards a more balanced, sustainable future. What's your wish for the new normal?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
