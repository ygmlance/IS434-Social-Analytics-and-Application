Day 52

i actually took this photo right before circuit breaker started. this view gave me a sense of how the future (a.k.a. now) would feel like.. #

enclosed, yet safe.
isolated, yet warm.
there's a longing for
the outdoors,
meeting people,
going places,
sharing non-virtual experiences..
but that'll have to wait.
and i will be patient.

it also reminds me of a line i love:
there's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.
