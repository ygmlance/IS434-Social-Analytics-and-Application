#thankfulthursday Back in April it was a period of “instability” when most of my cases were caught in the #sgcircuitbreaker period. The new regulations, the limitations of not being able to meet my clients to sign documents...I’m grateful that eventually they are solved and praying for the completions be smoothly done in the months to come too. Thank you for the support and trust. Let’s believe good days are coming! :) #propnex #powerfulnegotiatorsgroup #onepng #propertyconsultant #propertyconsultantkaren #singapore #sgrealestate #sgrealtor #sgproperty #award #propertymanagement
