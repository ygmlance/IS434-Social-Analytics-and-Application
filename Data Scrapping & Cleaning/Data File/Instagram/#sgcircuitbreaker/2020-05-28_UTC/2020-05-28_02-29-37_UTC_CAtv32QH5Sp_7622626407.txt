R E N D A N G // sometimes I look at beautiful food feeds with all that natural lighting and wonder why I donâ€™t have the discipline for it â€” esp when I work in social media ðŸ˜³ but then again, does it mean i can only cook in the morning where I can catch that nice light in my balcony? do they just not post their dinners??? anyway. I reduced the gravy separately and it worked well. would have liked the colour to be deeper, but Iâ€™m not sure if it was because of the choice of meat (pork) or I just needed to cook it longer?

despite the lacklustre pic, this pork rendang was damn good. 7 hours in the making (cheated with the thermal cooker ðŸ¤“), gravy was flavourful, meat was so tender â€” tho it gave me a food coma ðŸ˜¶ will definitely make it again.
