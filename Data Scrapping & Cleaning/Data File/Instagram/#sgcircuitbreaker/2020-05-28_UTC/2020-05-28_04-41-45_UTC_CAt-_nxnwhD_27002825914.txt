😻SHERMS COOKS: CHICKEN AND VEGGIE BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP
-
At first I was thinking of plating it up as I normally do, but then the cherry tomatoes started getting very watery so I just thought to toss it all in a bowl of Trader Joe's Butternut Squash soup. 😂

Veggies➡️Love this butternut squash soup; it's sweet and low calorie! Also have half a box of spinach and some cherry tomatoes. And had some blueberries as a little dessert on the side.

Protein➡️Sous vide chicken breast marinated in some peri-peri sauce for a bit of flavor. I  cooked it a couple days ago and tossed it in the fridge, so super convenient 👌

Carbs➡️Multigrain sourdough by @fredosbaker. I don't understand how their sourdough can taste so delicious 😍 So tangy and the seeds have such a nice crunch 👌 I even bit down on a pumpkin seed, what a delightful explosion of flavor.
