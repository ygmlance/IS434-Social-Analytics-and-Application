Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 52:
Mapo tofu is a simple dish to cook with little preparation. This is one of the first few dishes mum taught us when we started learning how to cook. She introduced us to this spicy bean paste from @kwongwohhingsaucefactory as it has the best flavour out of all the different brand in the market. Seriously foolproof!

I had the mapo tofu with butterhead lettuce as a low-carb alternative. The butterhead lettuce holds the mapo tofu like a â˜• cup! Cute and tasty!

Recipe:
1. Stir fry the chopped garlic till fragrant.
2. Add in minced pork and fry till fully cooked. The meat will release some fat into the pan (depending on how fatty the mince is)
3. Add spicy bean paste into the pan and mix well. Add a spoonful of brown sugar to balance the flavour.
4. Have a taste of the sauce and season to taste accordingly. (You may need to add more bean paste or sugar, depending on your preference)
5. When ready, add in silken tofu and mix it gently into the minced meat. 
6. Garnish with spring onions and serve.
