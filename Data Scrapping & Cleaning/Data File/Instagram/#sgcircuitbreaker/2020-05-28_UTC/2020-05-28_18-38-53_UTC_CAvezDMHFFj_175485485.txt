The # SeeItBlue initiative is part of the global campaign # MakeItBlue that started in the UK and is currently in 17 countries, including USA, Canada, Mexico, Spain, France, Italy, Denmark, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and now Singapore. It has inspired several initiatives working with celebrities and organisations across the globe to help with the pandemic.

33 key Singapore landmarks across the island will turn blue as a display of solidarity against COVID-19.

Titled # SeeItBlue, this inaugural campaign seeks to highlight the importance of mental wellbeing during this trying time and raise awareness for mental health, as well as serve as an opportunity to thank all key workers on the frontline.

The nationwide light show will run every Thursday at 8pm starting from 7 May 2020 until the end of the “circuit breaker” on Jun 1.

The Singapore campaign is spearheaded by local communication agencies Hill + Knowlton Strategies, Lumina Live, Mercury Live and Mercury PR, and is supported by Keppel Group, Land Transport Authority, Marina Bay Alliance, Millenia Singapore, Pan Pacific Hotels Group, Singapore Tourism Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority.

The # SeeItBlue initiative intends to add more buildings and prominent areas over the next few weeks. The movement also seeks to encourage people to “see” and acknowledge the importance of mental well-being during these unprecedented times.

The National CARE Hotline provides emotional and psychological support for all who are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and is manned 24/7 by trained volunteers. If you need someone to talk to, please call the Hotline at 1800-202-6868 (From: CNA News)
