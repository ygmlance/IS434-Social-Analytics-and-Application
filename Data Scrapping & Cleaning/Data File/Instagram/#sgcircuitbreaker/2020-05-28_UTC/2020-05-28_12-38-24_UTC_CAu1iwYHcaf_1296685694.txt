Hubby cooked this Curry Fish upon my request for our wedding anniversary yesterday since we can’t dine out during circuit breaker period. .

A simple & satisfying meal that ends with my mango cheesecake for dessert. (see my previous post) .

Here’s the recipe for the curry fish if you wish to try:.

𝙄𝙣𝙜𝙧𝙚𝙙𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙨: 
1.7kg sea bass head & half body *
1 box Prima Taste Singapore Curry sauce kit
Chopped vegetables (we use lady fingers, brinjal and tomatoes)
1 pack tau pok
1 pack fried tau kee.
. *we bought a 3.5kg whole sea bass for $45.50 at the wet market and asked the fishmonger to cut into half for us and use the top half to make this curry fish head as we like to eat more fish meat. 😄

𝙈𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙙𝙨:
1) Steam fish for 15-25mins depending on the size of fish till cooked.
2) Pour 450ml water and Singapore Curry Paste into a big pot. Mix well and bring to a boil. 
3) Add in the tomatoes, brinjal, lady fingers and taupok. Mix well and bring to a boil. 
4) Mix Singapore Curry Premix with 200ml water. Add in the pot and simmer for about 7 mins without covering the pot, stirring occasionally. 
5) Place the cooked fish on top of the cooked vegetables together with fried tau kee. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2-3 minutes. 
6) Serve hot with rice. Enjoy! .
