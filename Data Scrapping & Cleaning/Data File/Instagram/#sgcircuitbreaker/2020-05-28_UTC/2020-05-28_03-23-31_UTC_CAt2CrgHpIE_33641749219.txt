There's so many different types of skincare products out there in the market, sometimes it is tough to decide which is suitable for your skin.

Researching is a big headache and that's why we've decided to bring you occasional reviews by our very own!

Our reviews will be based on products we have actually bought and tried ourselves. None of our products is sponsored. So you can be sure that our reviews are 100% unbiased 😊

Here's the first one!

"Having read all about the importance of double cleansing as the basis of every skincare routine, I decided to try out this oil cleanser every one was raving about.

Take note, I have not been using any oil cleanser all this while so this is definitely something new to me. I've always only been using a water based cleanser to remove my sunscreen and felt it was not quite enough.

After the first use, my skin was noticeably smoother and feels much cleaner than usual. Not exaggerating! It was then that I realized how useful oil cleansers are for deep cleansing and removing not only sunscreen but excess sebum too.

The texture of the oil balm feels like sorbet (y'know like the ice cream). It is easy to spread over my face and emulsifies into a milky liquid upon contact with water. 
The ingredients are gentle and suitable for sensitive skin and did not cause any breakout for me. In fact, I notice that I have lesser breakouts since using it.

Will definitely stock up when I'm done with the first tub. But there are also a few other balms out there that I'd still like to try ☺️." - D.
