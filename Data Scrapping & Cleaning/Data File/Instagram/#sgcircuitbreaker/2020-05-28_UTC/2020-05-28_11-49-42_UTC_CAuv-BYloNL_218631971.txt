简简单单又一餐！炒个菜，弄个妈蜜汤，再把剩下的午餐肉解决了。

话说我终于把一罐午餐肉解决了，一个人吃一罐真的很多。平时的我很少吃午餐肉，基本上我都不会选来吃，因为是加工食品，防腐剂调味料太多。不过因为行动管制，就买了两罐放在家。现在觉得我可以被防腐一阵子了，要等多几个星期才会把另一罐解决吧。

Simple and fast dinner tonight. Veggie, luncheon meat and marmite soup to settle my meal. 
Side note: finally I finished one can of luncheon meat by myself. It’s really too much to finish the whole can of luncheon meat alone especially when I seldom eat. Rather I choose not to eat because it’s processed meat where alot of preservatives were added. Probably will wait for a few more weeks before I will eat again since I will be preserved for the time being 😅
