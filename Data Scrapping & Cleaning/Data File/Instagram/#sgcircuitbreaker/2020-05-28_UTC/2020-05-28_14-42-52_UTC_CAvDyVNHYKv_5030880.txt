Guess what makes Kyan gave a satisfying thumbsup ? Swipe left to see What i #whippedup in the kitchen today !

Had some balance angus minced beef sitting in the fridge & i m kinda sick of the usual pasta dishes so I #google & i chanced upon this Asian Beef Bowl ! We love it so much cuz it tastes so different frm our usual eats !

The leftover sauce can also be used to make some noodles , thats what we did for dinner 👻 Mixed it in with some egg noodles & you are all good to pair it with some steamed #小笼包 🙃
