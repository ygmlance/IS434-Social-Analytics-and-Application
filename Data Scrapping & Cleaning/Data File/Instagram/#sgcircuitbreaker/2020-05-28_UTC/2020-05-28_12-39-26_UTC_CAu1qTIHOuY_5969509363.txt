{MINI BAKE SALE}

So last weekend I held my first bake sale in a box and it was a great success!! ðŸŽ‰ Featuring speculoos brownies, choc chunk macadamia nut cookies and lemon blondes ðŸ˜‹ am super grateful to all who supported me in this! Have always loved baking and glad to be able to bless others in this way :") part of the proceeds from the sale have been donated to Project Love: Overcoming COVID-19 For Families in Crisis.

Stay tuned for the next bake sale in June! ðŸŽ‰
