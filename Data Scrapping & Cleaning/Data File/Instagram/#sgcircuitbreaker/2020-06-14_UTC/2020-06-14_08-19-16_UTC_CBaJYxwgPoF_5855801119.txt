Are you looking for a motivating and yet efficient practice strategy? Backward 🔙practice is for you❗

Most of the students are very motivating to learn a new piece but in the half way or towards the end of the piece, the progress is getting slower🐌 and some students choose to give up.WHY❓

This is because the student always:-
.
💚Take longer time to learn the the second half of the piece
.
💚No more motivation to finish the piece
.
💚Know the starting very well and just keep repeating

Eventually, they set the MINDSET that second half of the piece is more 'difficult and harder'.
.
.
Hence, working from the end 🔚to the start is a FANTASTIC TIP for everyone. This will avoid the player to waste time to repeat the part that already mastered it.

Besides, you will stay VERY MOTIVATED because there is a 'hole'⛳ to fill up. At this time, you can't wait to finish the piece and this will PROMPT you to learn new section faster🎢.
.
.
As a result, you feel 'REWARDED'' 🎁as you're getting closer to your goal.

One thing we have to realiase the moment we start our practice, this could be the MOST important session as our battery is 💯 charged!

This is the reason why you need to backward practicr BEFORE you touch up the starting session.

Do you have students who keep repeating from the beginning❓👇COMMENT below...
