@fishncosg dinner treat from a friend - had to order my favourite New York Fish & Chips! Fish & Co. is offering two petite sized fish & chips (from a choice of 5 'countries') with two cans of coke for $25.90. We chose NY and Best. And we added in a seafood platter for one pax at $26.70 (2nd pic).
.
Ordered through grabfood but order came late bcos the pick-up got cancelled by two riders. So I guess the food was prepared on time but delivered late, hence we didn't get piping hot food (despite being in close proximity to the venue) and the fries had turned a little soggy. But still, both the fish and chips were well seasoned and fried to perfection. The grilled prawns from the seafood platter were so good and the grilled sotong were chewy. All in all, we had quite a full meal for four pax.
