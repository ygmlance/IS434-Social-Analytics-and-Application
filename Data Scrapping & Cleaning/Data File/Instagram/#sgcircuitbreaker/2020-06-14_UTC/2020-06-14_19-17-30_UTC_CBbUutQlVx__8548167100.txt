🌲 @gardensbythebay is a must go if you’re ever in singapore 🥺 it’s a full blown garden from your dreams! i was definitely most amazed by the supertree grove. these “trees” are so beautifully constructed, and home more than 700 species of plants on them! it’s hard not to fall in love with the architecture and beauty of this place. def recommend!⁣

🤔 singapore is my biggest travel fail when it comes to eating good food. they are PRIZED for their amazing hawker food, and we did not do our research and ended up eating mall food 😂😭 more reason to go back! what is your biggest travel food fail?⁣

💸 the supertree grove is free to walk through, but the observatory and skyway cost $8-$12. there are also other conservatories you can visit that are $28 for 2!⁣
