Post CB Master Chef not over yet ok. Really grateful for having had more time to explore cooking adventures at home.

The girls were literally arm deep into the cookie dough, kneading and enjoying the funny texture.

Initially we wanted to make chocolate chip cookies, but this forgetful mummy didn't buy any. So we resorted to nutella cookies.

No regrets here, super yummy treat of the weekend. Not buying outside cookies anymore I guess 😝🍪
