Walked round and round for miles last night because I couldnâ€™t find an exit. As part of its crowd control measures, Waterway Point closed most of its exits, so if you really want to hatch a Pokemon Egg or unlock a Wizards Unite Portkey in a safe and well-lit environment without really going anywhere, I highly recommend. 5/5. #sgcircuitbreaker #phase1
