Sunday is a great day to unwind🤸‍♀️⁠
⁠
While you are relaxing, try this simple pose that can help to stretch your hips and glutes, as well as lubricate your hip joints which can become stiff from long hours of sitting.⁠
⁠
For better restoration and grounding🏔, try our new supine yoga class on Tuesday evenings and Thursday mornings, which will bring you through a series of postures done on your back, face up. ⁠
⁠
These slow and controlled movements are coordinated with mindful breathing techniques🙆‍♀️, and are a great way to massage your abdominal pelvic muscles, increase flexibility, relieve stress, and nurture a healthy gut!⁠
