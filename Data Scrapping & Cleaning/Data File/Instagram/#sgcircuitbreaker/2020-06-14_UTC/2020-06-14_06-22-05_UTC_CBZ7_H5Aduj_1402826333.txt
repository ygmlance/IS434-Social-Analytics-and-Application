Happy Sunday! Sharing some notes 📝  on cellulite control. ⁣
Cellulite is caused by a buildup of fat underneath the skin. Some of us are more predisposed to it than others. The amount of cellulite you have and how noticeable it is, is likely attributed to factors like your genes, body fat percentage, and age. The thickness of your skin also affects the appearance of cellulite. People of all body types and weights can get cellulite, so you are not alone. ⁣
