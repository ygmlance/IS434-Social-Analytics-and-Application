Recently, I am on a discovery journey of myself. But in order to know who I really am, I need to know who this Mr Universe is. Who's my Creator? Who decides my paths and who decides when I should say farewell.
.
.
I will be the world's greatest fool to say my life is in my hands and I determine who I am. I definitely can't confess repeatedly and visualise to whatever I want, because there's a Greater Being who holds our lives in His hands. I think a wise man will instead ask what is His plan and respond to it accordingly. .
.
This is a very interesting journey. If this Mr Universe treasures me to the extent of giving His everything for me, how should I respond?
.
.
What if He says to me (you), "I want you to give up all these (business, achievements, fame etc)" Will I (you) give up even not knowing what the future holds?
.
.
What's my (your) response?
.
.
Are we ready to slow down, take a pause, reflect and ask a very important question in our lives, "What is Your desire for me". You see... It is so difficult to come to this place of asking, unless everything is taken away. Because it is so hard to let go. .
.
Many times (could be all the time) when things are taken away from us, it can be for a greater good. .
