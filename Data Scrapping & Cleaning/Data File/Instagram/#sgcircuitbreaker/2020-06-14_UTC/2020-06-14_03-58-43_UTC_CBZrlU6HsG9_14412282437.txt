How sweet are these colours! Very pleased with these compartments to store my clay! Made with used papers and washi tapes!
.
Anyway, sidetrack a little; wanna voice my thoughts since #sgcircuitbreaker started due to Covid. As non-essential workers had to stay home everyday, takeaways could become a daily lifestyle for some. Well, not sure if im the weird one but it disturbs me much when i see plastic containers being used only once and gone to waste just for the convenience of not needing to wash tupperwares and cutlery! Much more for plastic carriers😕
.
I feel, for starters, saying NO to plastic straws and cutlery is a very good start. At least washing spoons and forks aren't as tired as washing plates and bowls? Same for metal straws which usually come with suitable brush sizes for washing. Also, bring some used plastic carriers out whenever u leave home either for takeaways or grocery shopping. You'll be surprised how many times 1 plastic carrier can be used repeatedly till it gives in.
If you have read till here, thank you so much for listening to my tiny voice☺ Really hope we can all play our part for the environment 🌱🌍💖
