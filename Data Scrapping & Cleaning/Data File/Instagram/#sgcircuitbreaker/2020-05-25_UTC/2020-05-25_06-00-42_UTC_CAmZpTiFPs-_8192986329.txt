Long weekend calls for a special preparation..
❤Misal ... I know it doesn't require any intro..
झणझणीत ( hot & spicy).. Misal has very special place in my heart...
Irresistible delicacy from my hometown Kolhapur🤗...
I always try to save Misal for next day.. cuz it tastes even better 😋😋..
PS... Misal is served with a slice of bread in Kolhapur..
💠I like to eat less of bread & more of Misal (holding hanky in hand 🔥🔥)...
How do you guys like it..
⭐Traditional Kolhapuri recipe of Misal Tarri,Kat (red gravy) is in my stories/highlights ..

Have a Happy Long weekend..
