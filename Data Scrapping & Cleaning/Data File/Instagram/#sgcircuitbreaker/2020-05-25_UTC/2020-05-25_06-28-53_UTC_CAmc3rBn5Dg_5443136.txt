Got our @boberteasg fix, and every sip was well worth the carbs/ calories! Pleasantly surprised that the Brown Sugar Crème Brûlée Milk 😋🍮 wasn't as sweet as I had expected, the fragrance of brown sugar wasn't compromised, and the pearls were of perfect consistency.
.
The Taro Latte 🍠💜was also another surprising find, packed full of flavour, and came with one of the yummiest toppings around so far: Coconut Jelly!!! 🥥🌴 Nope, nothing close to the artificially flavoured "rainbow" jelly with the plasticky texture and aftertaste... But as close to real coconut as it gets. We highly recommend this combination, and will definitely order this again! 👍🏻💜💜💜
.
Unfortunately, the delivery menu is rather limited for now due to the nature of some drinks, and there are so many other flavours that I'd like to try when this #sgcircuitbreaker ends, and our fave  Bubble Tea stores are allowed to open again! 😍😋😛 Super happy to have had my bubble tea fix though!!!
