Kyan loves to build ! When he starts building, his creativity flows endlessly. 
Initially he asked me, mummy can you teach me how to build ? The next minute when i m done taking my dump, I came out to all these ðŸ¤© 
There are some things in life, kids can do it better than us. This for instance, they have better creativity that us :) Good job Kyan !
