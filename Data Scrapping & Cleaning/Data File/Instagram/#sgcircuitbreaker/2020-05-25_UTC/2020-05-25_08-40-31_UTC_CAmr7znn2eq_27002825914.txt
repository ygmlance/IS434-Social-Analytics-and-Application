😻SHERMS ASSEMBLES: ASIAN-THEMED LUNCH
I didn't cook a single thing on this plate 😂
-
Carbs➡️Matcha bagel stuffed with azuki and mochi filling from @sistersfield! I just recieved 16 bagels and a cranberry walnut sourdough from them ystd, can't wait to slowly eat my way through them 😋
-
Protein➡️Tuna sashimi (I got some sliced packaged tuna sashimi wholesale from @unicofoods_sg)
-
Veggies➡️Kimchi, 1 whole cucumber and some homemade miso soup (which is essentially dashi stock, 1/2tbsp miso, some seaweed and some enoki mushrooms I cooked in the microwave). So yummy and full of good probiotic bacteria!🔥
