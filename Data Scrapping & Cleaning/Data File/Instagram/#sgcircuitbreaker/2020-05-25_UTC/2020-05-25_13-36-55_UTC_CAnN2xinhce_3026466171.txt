Since everyone is at home, we held a Takoyaki party. Instead of the usual Octopus filling, we substituted with the Chinese dumpling 饺子filling. I must say, this actually tastes better than those I hv eaten in Osaka. I somba 🙋🏻‍♂️. .
It come with crunchy cabbage and flavourful juicy meat inside. And crispy outer surface with the sweet and tangy sauce. So yummy 😋 😋

This is my first time trying out the Takoyaki pan from @brunohotplatesg . It is so easy to use and we have so much fun cooking with it. .
