Throwback of yesterday lunch cooked for my birthday boy. I bought my Cooked Frozen Duck Confit from @singaporehomecooks group buy. .

This is so easy to cook. All you need is just pan fried the skin side till crispy and lightly cook on other side will do. .

The more lecheh one will be the creamy truffle mash. 
I peeled and cut potatoes into small chunk size and cooked them in salted boiling water for ard 15mins till softened. Drain off water, add in salted butter and mash it to paste. Add in cream mix well and push it thru a strainer to further refine it. Add in salt, pepper and milk, mix well to a creamy consistency. Add truffle oil to taste.

For the sauce, I heat up pan with duck fat and butter, add in cranberry jam mixed with water. Cook till thickened. Taste and add seasoning if required. .

The Duck Confit is so crispy on the skin and yet tender on the meat. I bet I gonna order some more again. .
