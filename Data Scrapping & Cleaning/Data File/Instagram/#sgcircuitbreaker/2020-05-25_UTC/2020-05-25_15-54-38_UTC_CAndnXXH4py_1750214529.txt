Yes I've been a #circuitbaker these few weeks. Already enjoyed making bread but found more time to try other types like tangzhong, ciabatta and foccacia.

Tangzhong works like a fluff it is for yeast breads, not sure why I've not done it earlier! It's basically an inclusion of a thick slurry/water roux made with flour and water at 1:5 ratio to yield a tender crumb and help bread stay soft and fresh longer.

Some math is involved if you want to convert a standard recipe as tangzhong should be utilized at between 5-10% of total flour required and is used inclusive, not in addition, to an ideally 75% hydration dough.

Suggest to try a recipe off the Web and get comfortable with the technique first!
