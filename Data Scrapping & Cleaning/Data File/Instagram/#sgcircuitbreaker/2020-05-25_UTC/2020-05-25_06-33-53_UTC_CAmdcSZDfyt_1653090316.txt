Made this holey and crispy edge pizza. Everyone loves it, good thing I was still able to bake it, as the oven that I often used for baking pizza is faulty, causing my circuit breaker to trip. Good thing my other smaller oven works well 😅. The pizza was topped with truffle salami with olives and yellow bell pepper . Swipe left/right to browse through the pic. ☺️
