Was reading that gas build up in a bunny is a painful thing. Then my mind started wandering and I remembered a doggy once upon a many years who used to open the door and sat lovingly looking at me while I was asleep. No sound was heard but man, the pong would always get a scream out of me. They do say the silent ones are the deadly ones. Have a good Monday. .
