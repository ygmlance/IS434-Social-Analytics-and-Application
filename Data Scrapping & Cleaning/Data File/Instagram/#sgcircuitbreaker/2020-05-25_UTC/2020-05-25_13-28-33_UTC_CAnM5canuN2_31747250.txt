Maggi curry with a side of freezepak chicken nuggets.
.
So, recently there’s been some commotion regarding how the freezepak chicken nuggets is almost similar to McNuggets but I begged to differ.
.
The “meat” is rather mushy to me like it has been emulsified into a paste with other fillers though I don’t mind eating it.
.
I preferred seaweed chicken as it tastes more like real chicken meat.
