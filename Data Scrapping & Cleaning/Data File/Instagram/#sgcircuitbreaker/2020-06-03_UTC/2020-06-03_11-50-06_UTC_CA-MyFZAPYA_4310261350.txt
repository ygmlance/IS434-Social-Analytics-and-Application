Coral Charm Peonies are such unusual chameleons.
. 
They start off as tightly packed, golf ball sized buds,  gradually opening up into enormous fluffy flowers (as big as cabbages...? ðŸ˜†). .
Once fully bloomed, the petals gradually morph from a striking magenta to a pretty pink, slowly softening to the prettiest shade of dusty rose. A most unusual flower. .
