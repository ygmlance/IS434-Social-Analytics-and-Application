@laohuotanggroup for dinner tonight ‘cuz it’s my girl’s FAV soup restaurant! 🥣 I swear I’m not saying this cuz’ it’s sponsored, if you followed me for some time already you’d probably have seen us dining out at their outlet few times a week. Hehe. 🙃
-
Our must orders:
1️⃣Apple Pear Soup - Fayth & Hope’s FAV!
2️⃣Lotus Root Soup - who doesn’t love a good one?
3️⃣Pork Tribe Soup - the Hubs love the soup but he doesn’t know how to eat innards so it’s mine. Eh I tell you I don’t normally eat pig stomach but LHT’s one is SUPER SOFT & not rubbery at all! My fav! 😋

Anyway @laohuotanggroup is now available for Islandwide Delivery via WhatsApp 8323 9119 & Oddle! Grabfood, Foodpanda & Deliveroo!
