It's the end of the circuit breaker! While it's not a big change for many, families do get to rejoice (some sort). Since there's the whole 2-persons-to-visit thing, only Ryleigh gets to stay with grandma. She's bloody happy. 
As compared to when she stays with me and she looks like a tired mom like me. 
On another note, Arielle fell asleep last night calling out for her older sister in the most pitiful voice.  She even started calling Ayah "Aileeeeee". I'm still Mahhh mehhhhh.
