Dinner feast from @jacksplacesg last night to celebrate the father's 80th birthday! Steak turned out too tough when ordered in. The best item we ordered was the beef stew. And I like that they packed the toppings for the baked potato separately. Delivery came 45 mins early though and threw us off our timing. Still worth considering this for your dinner as food was still warm when it arrived!
