Watching Lucas grow up has been such a joy ü•∞
One thing I never compromise on is what I feed my son. I place a lot of importance on product authenticity and ensure that Lucas gets complete and balanced nutrition to support his growing needs. 
That‚Äôs why I only give him PediaSure Gold purchased from official sources. PediaSure Gold is made, stored, and safely delivered by trusted Singapore logistics partners. With official sellers, (such as major supermarkets + official online stores), I have no doubt about the source and the quality of the product. If you‚Äôre shopping online, look out for the ‚ÄúSingapore Trust‚Äù logo.

For moms who are value seekers, PediaSure Gold offers 25% savings with their 2.4kg value pack (consists of 4x 600g). @PediaSure.sg
