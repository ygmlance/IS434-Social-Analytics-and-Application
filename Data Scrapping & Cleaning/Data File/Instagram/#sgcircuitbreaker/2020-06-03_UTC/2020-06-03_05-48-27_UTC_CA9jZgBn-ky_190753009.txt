Today I tabao Yam Cake and Glutinous Rice from Thong Kay. Yam Cake had a soft silky texture, with small Yam Cubes. Glutinous Rice was well-cooked, not too soggy and sticky. All items were delicious, not overly salty and oily. Generous portion at $2 each.

It’s now Post Circuit Breaker Phase 1. Do continue to eat well, stay safe and healthy.
