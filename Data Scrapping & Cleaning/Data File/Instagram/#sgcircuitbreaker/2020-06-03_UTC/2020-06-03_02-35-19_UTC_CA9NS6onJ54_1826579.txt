Rochor River with demolished Rochor Centre. Months ago, I was doing an architecture photoshoot mins away & this location caught my attention when I drove pass. I decided to walk down the river with my gears to capture a scene to remember Rochor Centre. I also include a "human element" of myself, which makes a perfect scene. Do you agree? haha ðŸ˜†
