⁣“MJ tonight?”⠀
⠀
It’s been an awful long time since I’ve asked or been asked these questions.  Get ready to HUAT in Phase 2 of Circuit Breaker with this Catbreed-19, but remember to wear a mask!⠀
⠀
Catbreed-19 is now available in the form of collar pins. You can spruce up your outfit, pencil cases, purses, bags etc with these cuties. Since we will never ever forget this moment, why not embrace it and remember it for life? ⠀
⠀
Catbreed-19 pins make perfect gifts and they are definitely a great conversation starter! Send these pins to your MJ kakis as Fortune Cats are also known to bring luck. ⠀
⠀
It’s available in Silver and Gold. For every Catbreed-19 pin sold, Maneki Meowment will be donating 10% of its proceeds to our frontline heroes. Support local and support a good cause at the same time.⠀
