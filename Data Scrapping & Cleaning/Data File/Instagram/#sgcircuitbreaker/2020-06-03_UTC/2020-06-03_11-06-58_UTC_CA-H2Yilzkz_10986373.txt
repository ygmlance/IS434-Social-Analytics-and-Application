There's more to Singapore street language other than the popular Singlish.
â €
In tomorrowâ€™s livestream COCO CHAT, Singaporean comedian Farah Lola will talk us through a very uniquely Singaporean street language commonly used within the Malay minority.
â €
There's really no specific name for this language, but it has been around for ages, just existing on the sidelines.
â €
Tune in to catch the conversation at 1pm SG time on June 4!
