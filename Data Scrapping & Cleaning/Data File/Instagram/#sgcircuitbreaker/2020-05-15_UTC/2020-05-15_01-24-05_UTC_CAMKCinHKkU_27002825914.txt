üòªSHERMS COOKS: PASTA AND MEATBALLS
-
Protein‚û°Ô∏èLOVE these meatballs by @miatavola_, they are so juicy and tender even after being frozen for a while. One of these whopping fistfuls of meat weigh a hefty 70 grams. And they're super flavorful and delicious. Even the tomato sauce freezes well and is still tangy and thick.

Carbs‚û°Ô∏èIts my first time having this unique Sicilian pasta, Casarecce; short twists of pasta rolled up onto themselves. The pasta is from @miatavola_ too, I got a bag of their handmade artisanal pasta. It takes about 6 mins to cook al dente, and I finished the last minute of cooking in a simple tomato sauce with garlic. I don't like my pasta too saucy (like 1/4 cup for this portion is good for me). Oh added in some parmesan cheese too. So yummy. And I'm not even a huge pasta fan.

Veggies‚û°Ô∏èJust some broccoli that was dying at the bottom of my refrigerator. I usually just microwave vegetables nowadays to steam/cook them.
