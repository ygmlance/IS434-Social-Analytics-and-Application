Do you feel happy listening to this tune, "you are my sunshine"☀️? Our mood usually change with the tune and lyrics of a song. A song with a more lively tune and positive lyrics tend to make people happier when listening to it and vice versa.

In sound healing, we apply neutral tone using acoustic tools (most of the time pure toning without a melody). This helps to eliminate the emotional attachment to certain tunes and lyrics, promoting healing on a deeper level, working all the way to the root cause of an issue.☘
