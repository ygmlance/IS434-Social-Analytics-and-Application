We shudder to see our amber glass bottles ending up in landfills... In the pursuit of global environmental sustainability, Le Vyr will be taking them back for reuse in Phase 3!

For every 7 bottles returned, we will give you back 1 free Kombucha of your choice for your next purchase! We would appreciate that the bottles are emptied out and cleaned, but otherwise we will still accept them to be deeply sterilised before reuse!

Bottles that are cracked, chipped, fractured or damaged in any way will not be accepted as they’ll not be safe for reuse!

More details on this initiative will be released nearer to Phase 3! 💪🏻 ⚠️: only applicable for our brown amber Kombucha bottles
