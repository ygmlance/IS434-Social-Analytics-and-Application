⁣One reason that people often struggle with the advice “follow your passion” is because “passion” is a nebulous term.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
At any given moment your passion may be hard to pin down, and even if it weren’t, it might change in a few years anyway.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
An easier approach is to follow your curiosity.⁣⁠
⁣⁠
