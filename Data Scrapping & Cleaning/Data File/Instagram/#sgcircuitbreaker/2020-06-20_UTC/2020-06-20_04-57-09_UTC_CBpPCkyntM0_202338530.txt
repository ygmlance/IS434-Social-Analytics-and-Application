Had a hair cut around Telok Ayer area. Decided to do take away. Before circuit breaker there is always a long line at @dumpling.darlings now, it has just reopened, it is a great chance to try. Had the original, fried pierogi and duck dumplings. My favorite are the fried pierogi and original. The noodles are very decent too. Would definitely do dine in go get more freshly prepared crisp and texture!! #musttry #takeaway #sg #sgcircuitbreaker #foodie #sgfoodie #foodporn #sgfoodporn #lunch #dumplings #pierogi #gyoza #noodles #stayathome
