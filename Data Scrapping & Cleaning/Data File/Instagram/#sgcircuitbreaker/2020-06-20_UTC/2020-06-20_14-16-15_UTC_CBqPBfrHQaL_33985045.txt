As we end phase 1 of CB and enter into phase 2, here I present to you the rump. The rump steak, more specifically the picanha, has a wonderful flavour with decent marbling. It’s our first time trying and what a wonderful piece of steak it was. On a side note, it’s pretty cheap as well! Thanks to @themeaterysg for recommending. Gonna be trying the Wagyu picanha next time round. Look for them for some nice cuts #supportlocal .
