Welcome Back 🌿 It was fantastic to have some dine-in customers yesterday, thank you very much for your support!  We look forward to serving more of our regulars and new customers at WANNA CUPPA. It would be wonderful to have the conversations💕, the jazz music🎷, the smell of great coffee☕️ and food🍝 filling this space again.
