Sorry guys ! Our Father’s Day Set is sold out !

We’re in the trenches this weekend, trying to get all these sets out, while handling the dine-in crowd that we miss so much.

THANK YOU for the support, anyone that has ordered delivery or takeaway from us during the CB period, and those visiting us again for dine-in.

Although the grilled meat set is sold out, we are still serving up our regular Peranakan Food menu for delivery, and you can still place your orders in time for Father’s Day.

Don’t forget, we offer FREE ISLANDWIDE DELIVERY for orders $50 and above. Link in bio.
