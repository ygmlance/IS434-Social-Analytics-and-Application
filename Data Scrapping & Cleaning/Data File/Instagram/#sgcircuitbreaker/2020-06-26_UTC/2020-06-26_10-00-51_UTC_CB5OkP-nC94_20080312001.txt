Test the technology ahead of time. Nothing kills momentum at the start of an online event like a 15-minute delay because people need to download software, canâ€™t get the audio and video to work, etc. This is a big no-no for us. Prior to a virtual event, speakers, moderators and participants should test the technology and make sure they are comfortable with the major features.
.
We walk our clients through the process of checking that everything is set up properly prior to their online event and ensure there will be no surprises during the webinar. This way, both the speakers and participants enjoy their online events!
