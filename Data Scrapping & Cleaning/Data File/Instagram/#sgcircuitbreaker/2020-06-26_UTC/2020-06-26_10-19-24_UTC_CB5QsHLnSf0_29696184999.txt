We wanted to fuse two of our favourite things together, Local Coffee & Kombucha. We were inspired by our nostalgic childhood, creating something so foreign yet familiar to all of us. ☕️
.
Remember having Kaya Toast Set breakfasts with mom and dad every weekend? Paired with a perfectly roasted brew of Kopi-O served on iconic ceramic wares.
.
Flavour so deep that runs from a fragrant, aromatic punch, slowly diffusing into a smoky, acidic finish. It was a perfect balance to round off every mouthful from lightly toasted kaya butter toasts dipped in half boiled eggs.

You won’t want to miss this! 😋
Launching on 8 July!
