If your day didn't start out too well, practise the Happy Baby Pose👶 !⁠
⁠
Just like the name itself, this pose can restore your good mood. Your spine has many nerves running through that feed your sensory experience with the world. By lying on your back, the intimate connection between the Earth 🌏  and your spine will help melt away stress, increase vitality, and cultivate inner joy🌟 !⁠
⁠
Happy Baby Pose is a great way to open up your hips, inner thighs and groins to release tension and stress accumulated in the hips and lower back. ⁠
⁠
If you have 1 minute to spare today 👉  settle down into this pose and give your spine and back muscles a good massage and amazing stretch!⁠
⁠
This pose is also part of a series of yoga postures and breathing exercises practiced on our back, face up, at our supine yoga class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. ⁠
⁠
Looking forward to seeing your happy faces on zoom, and at our studio opening on 4 July!⁠
