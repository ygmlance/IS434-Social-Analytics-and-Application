This sweet boy parked himself on my lap the minute I came home from work. He's telling me how much he misses me.

This doggie has been rejecting breakfast for the past week ever since I left for work. He only eats after I came home.

I guess he is having CB withdrawal syndrome. It might hit him hard again when big boss goes back to office.

P/S:
Have to give Big Boss a shout-out for waking up at 8am daily during the whole CB period to feed him👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I sleep in till 10am 😆😆😆 #sgpetstagram
