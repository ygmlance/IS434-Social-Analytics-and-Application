Perhaps the most creative-demanding thing a creative must continually deal with during the entirety of his/her career 𝙟𝙪𝙨𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙠𝙚𝙚𝙥 𝙞𝙩, is to come out with innovative ways to pattern break a certain stigma.

This post is another one of those attempts.

In response to this survey/infographic published on the Straits Times, a creative friend told me: ”It’s always like this. Artists first to be cited irrelevant. The 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙘𝙚𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 that we’ve been building around the industry, reduced and set back by an infographic”

I feel a jadedness in his tone. This is nothing new no matter the context. I could almost hear a silent plea: “𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙥 𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙞𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙪𝙨 𝙖𝙡𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙮”

What are we telling our young aspiring creatives? What are we instilling in the industry that already has a stigma to it within and without? What’s the point of this survey really?

Are creatives really just offended or are we simply defending our sense of identity and livelihood?

Art is so much closer to our day-to-day than we think. It is purposed to be particularly sensitive to the human condition and it’s in the business of creating human 𝙚𝙭𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙨.

This level of prevalence is also probably why it’s so “hidden” from many of us.

Believe me, we understand why you feel it’s not that important but we cannot just stand there without a response.
