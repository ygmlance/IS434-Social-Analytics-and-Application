Let’s bring back the community & kampung spirit!!! .
.
.
As society advance, kampung may have disappeared in our beloved homeland, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t continue the kampung spirit! .
.
.
Just a simple sharing with everyone what myself with my dear neighbours in my Punggol estate are doing to keep the kampung spirit going!! .
.
.
1. Introduce ourselves to our direct neighbours. Say hello neighbours & make aquaintances with them.
.
.
.
2. Food!!! Sharing lobangs through group chats, and making group buys too! Everyone can still enjoy our delicious local food at the comfort of our homes 🤗🤗 .
.
.
Anyone has any other ‘#kampung spirit’ activities that u are involved in with your neighbourhood estate too? Do share with me too! 😁😁🙏🏻🙏🏻
