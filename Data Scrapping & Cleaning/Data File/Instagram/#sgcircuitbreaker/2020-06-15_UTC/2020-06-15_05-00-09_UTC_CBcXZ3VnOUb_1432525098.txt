Don't liddat leh. Why need to be so Zek-Art to artist? The 71% are also trying to making their living.

Why does that survey hurt? For design related industry, it's not only a matter of being able to make things look good. In many occasions, we are always trying to evoke positive emotions, making things work out not only aesthetically, but also catering to physical, mental or market needs.

For Tee-Saurus and Rawr, its always about creating Happier Products for Happier Days, we want people to get a smile on their everyday life. And its the same as other designer brands in Singapore.

I know there's no right or wrong in the vote, it's just a survey. But do not dilute the very fact that design makes the world a much more beautiful place, visually, mentally and spirituality. And design culture shapes the entire way how we perceive the everyday life as well.

And lastly, the 71% non-essential artists are also only trying to survive and make ends meet. Be supportive of them, to us, design is not a profession, its a passion to drive and change the monotone to a livelier world and design means the whole world to us.â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
