One of my hobbies is indoor gardening! It requires specialised knowledge, patience, responsibility and watchful care. There is a joy in watching your plants bloom & flourish!⁣

In my opinion, I feel there are many similarities between my work as an aesthetic doctor and gardening 🌿🌸⁣

I have many plants babies at home - but these are a few I decided to put on my Instagram! In no particular order - I have a Peace Lily, Mint, Brazilian Pothos and a Sweet Basil plant. My pots are from @tumbleweedplantssg 🥰 ⁣

I miss going to the clinic. Can we move into Phase 2 already 😭⁣
