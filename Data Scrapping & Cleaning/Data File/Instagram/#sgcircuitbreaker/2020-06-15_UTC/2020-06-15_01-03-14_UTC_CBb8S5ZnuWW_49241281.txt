When I returned to Singapore back in mid 2005 I really couldn't stand the taste of durian, though I was totally alright with the smell.

I was a kind of a "potato" back then that only knew how to enjoy good chilli during school days. I still remember my classmates gasping in awe, because I used chopsticks to eat 😂

My absolute favorite now is D13 as it is super sweet and still creamy at the same time! The girls wouldn't have any of it though. Haha! Time to train you girls soon 😉 If not, more for me then 😋

Tried @pangzi.durian this time round. Approved! ❤️
