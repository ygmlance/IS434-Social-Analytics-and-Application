It's been almost 2 weeks since I last posted anything and today is the official announcement of Phase 2!! #sgcircuitbreaker started on 07-Apr and got extended till 01-Jun. We all 乖乖 stayed home for 56 days! And we began Phase 1 on 02-Jun thinking it would last for at least 4 weeks but we're well ahead of time! While Phase 2 commences this Friday on 19-Jun, let's continue to take the necessary precautions to stay safe and continue to be more socially responsible!  We'll beat this sh**! #stayunited #staysafeandstaysane #maskson #coronavirus #covid19 #singapore #circuitbreaker
