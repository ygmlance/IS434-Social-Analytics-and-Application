It has been years since I last patronized this other Malay stall (stall A) at my neighborhood.
.
I used to frequent them for their mee siam which used to be sooo good.
.
I like how intense the mee siam gravy is. The sourness from the assam together with the sweetness and spiciness from the sambal is very shiok.
.
Unfortunately, for some reason, their standard began dropping thus I jumped ship to stall B (which is where the mee soto in a previous post is from).
.
Today, I wanted to have mee soto again but stall B was closed hence I returned to stall A.
.
Both stalls are selling their mee soto at the same price ($3.50), but I am surprised to find a chicken drumstick in stall Aâ€™s mee soto (Stall B had chicken shreds).
.
I do not remember stall A offering drumsticks in their mee soto before.
.
Drumstick vs chicken shreds, which one would you go for?
