Happy Monday!

The hbb.sg team is excited to introduce our mascot Hubbuba (pronounced ha-ba-ba). Hubbuba is an HDB flat that came alive because he really wants to do something to help home-based businesses (HBBs) and self-employed Singaporeans, many of whom are his residents!

Hubbuba would like to ask for your help to like and share this post.

Thank you so much! (P.S. hubbub is a loud noise or general excitement and activity)
