Benefits of this pose

Stretches and Strengthens:
The active use of the hip flexors, stretches the muscles of the legs, psoas, and pelvis, in the downward movement of the legs. Together these muscles work on strengthening the core and abdominal muscles keeping the lumbar region (lower back) active and engaged too. With strong core muscles it acts as a support system for the lower back and hips.

Posture and Toning:
various muscles of the back are stretched and contracted. The active use of the shoulders and chest lengthens the sides of the upper body. The repeated stretching helps in toning and improving the posture of the back. Hence a good practice for students with a hunchback, or those who are obese.

Stimulation and Metabolism:
strengthens the inner-core muscles that surround the abdominal organs. The active engaging of the abdominal muscles (stretching and contracting) helps in stimulating the internal organs, with a primary focus on improving digestion and the assimilation of food. It also helps to relieve symptoms of stomach related problems such as gastritis, flatulence and bloating.

世界上有很多的东西
你生不带来死不带去
你能带走的只有自己和自己的脾气
你曾拥有最美的爱情
你听过最美丽的旋律
触摸过一个人孤独的恐惧
也看到过最美的风景
我跌跌撞撞奔向你。。。
