Here’s what our Father’s Day Box of Kueh looks like when arranged together. The Rempah Udang and Kueh Kochi all come nicely wrapped up in banana leaf of course, but we’ve ‘opened’ them up so that you get a nice look at what’s inside those parcels.

This new Father’s Day Box is available from now till 21 June, and is just $25nett to buy. Here’s a recap of all the goodies you get inside:

Kuih Kochi (4pcs)- Dumplings made from glutinous rice flour and stuffed with grated coconut

Pulut Inti (1pc) - Steamed glutinous rice with coconut filling,wrapped nicely in a banana leaf parcel

Kuih Kosui (6pcs) - Soft wobbly kuih flavoured with gula meleka, topped with grated coconut

Rempah Udang (2pcs)- Fragrant shrimp paste and glutinous rice wrapped in banana leaf

These things tend to go fast, so book early to avoid disappointment ! Order at link in bio.
