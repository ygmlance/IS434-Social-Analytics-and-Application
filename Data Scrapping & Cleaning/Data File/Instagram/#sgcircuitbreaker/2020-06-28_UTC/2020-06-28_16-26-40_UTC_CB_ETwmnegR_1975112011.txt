Presenting the latest addition to our collection. Chrysanthemum is a symbol of longevity and rejuvenation. Brewed as a tea, it is believed to have cooling and cleansing properties. This bar showcases prized chrysanthemum buds (杭州胎菊) sourced from Zhejiang, China, which are blended with fruity cacao from Rehoboth Estate, bringing forth elegant floral aroma and notes of honey with a long sweet lingering finish. Stocks are now available on our webstore.
