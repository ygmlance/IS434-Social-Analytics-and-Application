My lil foodie who likes to eat, eat, eat and eat ! Finallly headed out to town after the end of the circuit breaker , did alot of retail and f&b therapy ! We headed to @hoshinocoffeesg for some leg rest whilst he napped. Had their signature strawberry souffle pancake & mentai mayo fries and when he woke, his eyes reallly lit up !

Missing all these cafe hoppings alot but  fears still lingers deep in us whilst we do it due to #covid19 , hopefully like how the songs goes ... ABCs are what we need, Covid-19 we will beat ðŸ’ª

Stay safe everyone when u head out, rmb to be social responsible ! Have fun n stay safe !
