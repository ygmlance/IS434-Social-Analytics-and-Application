Spaghetti alla Carbonara.

Traditional carbonara with egg yolk. Dont need instant sauce.
This was made with bacon because it's almost impossible to find guanciale/panchetta in sg, especially during #sgcircuitbreaker
Authentic carbonara doesnt have any herbs like shown on photo but this was my first traditional carbonara and I have fallen in love with making this dish ever since because it's actually quite simple.
