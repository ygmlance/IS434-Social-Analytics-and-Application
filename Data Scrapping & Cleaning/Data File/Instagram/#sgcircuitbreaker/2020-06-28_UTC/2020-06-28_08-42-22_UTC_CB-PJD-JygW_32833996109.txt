Recently heard of this dough that is made of plain flour, salt, water, cream of tartar, oil and food-grade coloring! 
Deemed to be taste safe, non-toxic and no chemicals for the little ones.

Perfect for Nacen as he tends to put his fingers in his mouth! 🤭

For him, it is his first time trying his hand on a play dough! No double guessing here, he'd wants to make some food out of it! 😋

Having lots of fun making his yummy strawberries🍓!
