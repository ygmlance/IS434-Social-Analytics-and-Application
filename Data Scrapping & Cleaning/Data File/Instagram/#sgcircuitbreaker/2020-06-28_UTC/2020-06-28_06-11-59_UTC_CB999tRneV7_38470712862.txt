Pek Cha Kway Teow with eggs.
Tips: high heat. add the egg the last so that it's not overcooked.

Sometimes I miss home and simple comfort food like this plain fried kway teow. As medan lang with Hokkien (福建) heritage, this is one of the most basic yet endearing Hokkien food. If there is any cooking I cant live without it's fried kway teow. 
Als, basically it's akin to Aglio Olio Hokkien style
