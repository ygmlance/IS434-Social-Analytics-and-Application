Cold calling - part and parcel of life of any insurance agent, telemarketers.

BUT ITS A NIGHTMARE !!! Plus WFH !!! However, told myself not to give up because giving up is for the weak ! 
I am on a mission to call every singaporean i can to check if they have upgraded their medishield life as this is a critical period and everyone should be at least covered for the hospital bills.

For someone with covid 19, the government will cover the hospital bills. But do you know that there is a mini epidemic not known to many ? 
That is DENGUE ! As of 3 june 2020, there are about 9000 cases and 176 active clusters.  Someone unfortunate who contracted dengue will have to pay their own hospital bill, and if someone do not have it, its coming out of your own pocket.

Hence, be safe and get yourself protected.
