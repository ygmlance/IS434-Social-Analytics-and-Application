Ever wonder what is behind success of a business? Many sleepless, stressful nights, late night work, long working hours and even lack of time for family. Furthermore, success is a journey not destination. I know it all because I married a man who is a serial entrepreneur and slogged many years together as a couple. However tough it is, we have come a long way for more than 5 years now so here's to many more (hopefully less tiring years haha). The founder behind @woodlandsdurian is my partner for the current giveaway (check out the post). Pm me for special promo code if interested. Hope I wont get fat or diabetes eating durians at this rate haha. .
