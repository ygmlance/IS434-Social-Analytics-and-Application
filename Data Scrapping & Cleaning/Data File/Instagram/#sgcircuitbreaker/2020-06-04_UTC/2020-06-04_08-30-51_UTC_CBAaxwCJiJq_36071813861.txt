We spent the mid year #schoolholiday of 2020 at home 24/7. This was in contrast with 2019 when we visited museums, libraries, parks and gardens. Nevertheless, our P1 son was learning more about mathematics and trying to teach his little sister in #summer2020. #our123gratitude #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe
