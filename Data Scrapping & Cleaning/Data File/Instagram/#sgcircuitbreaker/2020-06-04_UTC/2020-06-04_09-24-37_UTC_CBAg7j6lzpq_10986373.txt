A local minimart said Tuesday it tracked down a customer it overcharged by over S$1,000 (US$700).
⠀
The Angel Supermart in Ang Mo Kio said it managed to find the unidentified man charged S$1,397 instead of S$13.97 for his Sunday snacks and drinks. The grocer even posted a selfie with him online to show all was forgiven.
⠀
“Customer found, apology accepted, wefie with our team taken,” the minimart wrote on its Facebook page this morning, a day after it put up an appeal to find him. The neighborhood grocery store did not reveal the man’s name.
⠀
“We are SORRY! Our staff pressed the wrong amount and failed to verify, pls contact us for refund!” the supermarket said in an online post yesterday evening with an image of the receipt.
⠀
For his trouble, the man also received a VIP membership card that allows him to get a supply of free drinks and snacks from the mart.
⠀
Founder Daniel Tan told Coconuts Singapore that they only identified the error after the shop had closed and the day’s sales registered.
⠀
The minimart tried searching to no avail for the man’s personal details in its list of loyalty program members as well as the credit card clearing center. They then decided to go public on to avoid any misunderstanding.
⠀
He said the bucks have been passed to the errant employees.
⠀
“The staff has been issued a warning and are counseled. They will be paying the credit card surcharges pertaining to the refund,” he said.
⠀
The employees were new and would keep their jobs.
⠀
“We would like to provide a conducive environment for staff to learn and grow,” he added.
