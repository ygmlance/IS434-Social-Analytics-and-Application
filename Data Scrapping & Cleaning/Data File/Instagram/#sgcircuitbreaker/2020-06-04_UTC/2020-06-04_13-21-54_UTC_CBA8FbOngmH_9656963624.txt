Did you know that Bessie Coleman was the FIRST African American to earn a pilot's license?⁣
⁣
From the time she was young, Bessie worked hard to get what she wanted. When she decided to become a pilot, Bessie didn't let anything get in the way of her dream.⁣
⁣
Because of her race, Bessie couldn't learn to fly in the United States (and this shouldn't be the case for anyone, that our race be a stumbling block!). She took French lessons, worked many different jobs to earn money, then travelled to France to attend flight school. After earning her pilot's license, Bessie performed daring stunts in air shows for large crowds in Europe and the United States.⁣
⁣
Before she died, Bessie also dreamed of starting a flight school in the United States for people of color ❤️ Also, ADVENTUROUS: Bravery Magazine Issue 5 – AMELIA EARHART AND BESSIE COLEMAN + Conversation Guides, is a special anniversary edition featuring TWO adventurous aviators: Amelia Earhart and Bessie Coleman! Issue five is a "flip flop" issue–it's like getting two magazines in one! With two covers, two story sections and plenty of airplane activities, this issue might be our best yet. There’s even a special tear-out of our "Be Your Own Kind of Brave" art print in the middle!

This is truly an excellent and timely resource to spark meaningful conversations about privileges (or lack of), race and diversities. And let’s start these conversations going by first intentionally bringing in resources that features diverse races in our home libraries, ⁣
