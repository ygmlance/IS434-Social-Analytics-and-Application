The #SGCircuitBreaker may be over, but the dojo won't physically open till much later!

Fret not, coz' your weekly Karate Fun still continues Online!

Instead of the usual Facebook livestream, which has been a 1-way instruction, we'll be getting on a video conferencing platform.

This way, there will be 2-way communication with the Instructor to check through your practice.

As we can only afford to give the extra attention to a smaller group of participants, these COMPLEMENTARY online sessions shall be reserved for NIKO members only.
