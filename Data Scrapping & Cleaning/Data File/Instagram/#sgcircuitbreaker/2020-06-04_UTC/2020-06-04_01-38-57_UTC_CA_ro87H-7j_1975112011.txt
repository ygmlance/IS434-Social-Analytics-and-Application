碧潭飘雪, or Drifting Snowflakes Jasmine Green, is a traditional tea from Emei Mountain in the Sichuan Province. Made using top grade green tea harvested in Spring, layered with the best Jasmine flowers that bloom in Summer, it is an elegant tea that befits the name.
Our preparation with the floral and mildly fruity Indonesian cacao makes a chocolate that has a depth of flavour with lingering umami and jasmine fragrance.
