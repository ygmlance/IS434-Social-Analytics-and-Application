Circuit Breaker Phrase 1 - Day 1

Documented a series of photos consisted of 80 vehicles that passed by Telok Blangah Drive between 1.30pm-2pm on 2nd June 2020 from my home window. In the last 56 days of circuit breaker, most of us stayed at home & hardly any vehicles passed by this road. As we are now moving into Phase 1, our roads are back to life. Example, school buses are bringing the children back from school, the number of Grab cars and taxis have increased, delivery riders are still a common sight...etc. For those who don't belong to phase 1 like myself, do continue to stay safe. Do not be discouraged as the storm will eventually pass.
