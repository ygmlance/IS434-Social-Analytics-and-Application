Beautiful creation by @kaygracelee . Thank you for doing this piece! Its my favorite song by Eric Chou and I'm glad I caught it at the very last minute 😁 Even though we are not able to dance together in the studio but thankful for technology and more free time to allow us to connect in my tiny space. Also, Kay is having another class tomorrow at 8pm, do join it if you are keen, because she's one amazing teacher <3
