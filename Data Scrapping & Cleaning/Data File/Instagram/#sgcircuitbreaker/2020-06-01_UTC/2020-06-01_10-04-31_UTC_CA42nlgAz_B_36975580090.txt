During Singaporeâ€™s lockdown, I have had a lot of time to review my current life. I looked at the photos in my mobile, and I miss the places I once visited â€“ I swear that I will travel together with my family more often and enjoy my time with them.

I worry about my parents and my friends. Especially now, I feel that life is very fragile. I regret not spending more time with my parents. I worry about my job, and I worry about the economy as I recently applied for my BTO flat.

As for life after the coronavirus, I feel very confused. At the same time, I plan to work on a healthier lifestyle, earn more money and enjoy life.

Isolation at home has given me a lot of time for self-reflection. Also, self-discipline has been crucial in preventing my life from dismantling: creating order such as getting up and going to bed at fixed times, making an effort to learn something new online, exercising.
