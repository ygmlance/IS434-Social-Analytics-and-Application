Last day of Singapore #circuitbreaker! Do I miss having Clarice staying at home with me while I WFH? Yes & no, but she is not going back to preschool tomorrow yet. She will still have 4 more HBL till this Friday, as preschools across the nation are open in stages with different graders by age returning by different day. The last few days of HBL teaching contents are all gearing towards adapting ‘New Normal’ in school, likes wearing mask, more hand sanitization, social distancing & staggered drop-off/pick-up. Kids as young as PG have to deal with these, and I wonder how effective is the implementation, but together with the willingness & patience from teachers & co-operation from parents all things are possible.

Does Clarice miss her school or friends? Wifey & I have been conditioned her for returning to pre-school & asking her whether she missed her classmates or friends. She sometimes said yes, sometimes no. She apparently missing more staying at home & doing all the activities that I’ve planned together with her (some are school assignments). Looking back at some of these collages she seems to achieve more than at preschool while my work productivity suffers. Since I’m not SAHD & I have many more responsibilities, I still prefer her to be back to school. There are still ways to reconnect back after picking her up daily from her school. I’m counting down towards next Monday to be able to churn out more for works, but perhaps less IG stories about my little princess...
