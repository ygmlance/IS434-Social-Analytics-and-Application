[What does the End of CB Means to You]

Covid visited as a sweeping corrector and connector to the world. We were made to rethink our priorities, thoughts and actions. It made us consciously build on the relationships which truly matter.

My heart goes out to those who lost their lives in the fight, but today when the Circuit Breaker finally ends, let us continue to not let those lives lost be in vain, but social distance to the best way possible.

To celebrate the end of CB, the kids had a tea party and a presentation of the culmination of their art work during this trying time. What do you look forward the most, starting tomorrow?
