BIG NEWS: I’ve finally learnt how to use a sewing machine!! I’ve always wanted to learn it ever since I picked up embroidery little over a year ago, so I borrowed my sister @jeanettealexisq’s sewing machine to learn, with the help of some YouTube tutorials 🙌🏻
.
I started off small with some simple upcycling projects, using some t-shirts that I don’t really wear. I love the designs of these but I just have too many t-shirts! So I decided to give them a makeover into pieces that I would love and wear more often. 💛
.
Here’s the first of my upcycled pieces, a navy tube top paired with my bleach tie dyed sweatpants. I might bleach tie dye this top to match these sweatpants, but for now it’s a great basic top to have in my wardrobe 😍 Swipe to see what it looked like before it fell victim to my itchy fingers!
