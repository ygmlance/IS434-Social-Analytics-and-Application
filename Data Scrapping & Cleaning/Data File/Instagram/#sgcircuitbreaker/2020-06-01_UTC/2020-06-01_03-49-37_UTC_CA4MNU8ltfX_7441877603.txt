ðŸ”¹What does Financial Dignity mean to you?ðŸ”¸
.
I am in the Financial Services Industry to provide advice. It is also my mission to help every person I meet to have financial dignity be it in a good or bad situation.
.
For me, financial dignity means having enough money to continue living if I am not able to earn for whatever reason. It also means living debt-free and being able to both earn money, and spend key time with my family during the working week. It is also my wish to be able to take holidays, and to live comfortably for the rest of my life.
.
For parents with young children, why donâ€™t you write down your thoughts on how you envision the future with your family, and how you can protect your familyâ€™s financial dignity?
