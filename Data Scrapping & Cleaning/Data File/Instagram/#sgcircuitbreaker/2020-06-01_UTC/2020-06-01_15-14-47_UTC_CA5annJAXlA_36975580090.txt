My mum is a lovely, quick-witted 75-year-old with age-related macular degeneration, which has crippled her with extremely poor eyesight. To retard the degradation, she comes over from across the border, where she lives, for monthly eye injections at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

The lockdown announcement in April meant she had to find an alternative specialist in Johor â€“ and go for the visit without me. It was a milestone for both Mum and me. I have missed yet another important event: her birthday in May.

Not being with her has been unsettling. I believe that's why people call these unprecedented times. It's baffling, like living in a post-apocalyptic movie. Surgical mask-wearing is no longer limited to a medical environment â€“ now itâ€™s on the streets and in the stores. All so surreal. Mum is the one who grounds me but she is across the Johor Strait, and I can't get to her without cost. So near yet so far.

Will life ever be normal the way I knew it, or is this the new normal? I can't see straight anymore, and feel like I am wearing beer goggles!. Joyce, more than an observer, Malaysian and Singapore permanent resident ðŸ“¸: Joyce
