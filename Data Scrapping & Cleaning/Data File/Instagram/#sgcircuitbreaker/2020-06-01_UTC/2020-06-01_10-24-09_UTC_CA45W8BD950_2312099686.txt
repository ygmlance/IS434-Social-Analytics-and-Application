CB day 56 - I made it, and so did you!

THREE (3) things I learnt about myself - (1) I’m not a homebody. I love being at home, but I can’t stand being at home 24/7. 2) I thought I was an introvert but I’m really not. I miss my family & friends, and even my colleagues. Without them, life sucks! (3)Travel has become an integral part of me. I have been slapping myself multiple times in my mind for even thinking “I think I need to travel less” in Dec 2019. What the hell was I thinking? Got what I wished for and i have been regretting ever since. When non-essential travel resumes, I’m gg to find my 25% back! 
TWO (2) things I’m thankful for - (1) my job (2) my boys - human and fur. 
The ONE (1) thing that kept me sane - Super Junior! 슈퍼수니어. Listening to their songs, catching up on 15 years of SJ videos, and following their SNS activities. 
Post 1 June - Life continues to be not the way I want it to be. Looking forward to the day when I can #lifeisgood again #cccbdiary #sgcircuitbreaker #superjunior #sujuelf
