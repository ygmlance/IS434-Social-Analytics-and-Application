It’s time to work on those core muscles!

Join our student teacher, Muhammad Fikri Bin Fazil (@mdfikrifazil) from the Physical Education and Sports Science Academic Group (PESS) to keep fit at home. “Do keep in mind, you can change the workout style from duration scheme (40 seconds each exercise) into repetitions. 15-20 reps for each exercise except for plank. This will allow you to focus on your form, improving them as you carry out the exercises without any rush.
Once proficient, you can go back to duration scheme, maintaining the form throughout. Or, you can also increase the intensity by increasing the number of repetitions for each exercise.
Do remember to take short breaks in between the exercises, enjoy the video! 🙏💪” It’s Friday!! Breathe in and out with these simple stretches and welcome the weekend!
