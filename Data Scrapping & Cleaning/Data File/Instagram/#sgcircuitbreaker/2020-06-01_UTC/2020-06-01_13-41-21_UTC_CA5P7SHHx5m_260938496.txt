Heading back to work tomorrow? I am... My work had brought me to various places from the mainstream ones like Beijing, Tokyo, L.A., Fremantle, Montreal, Manila, etc. to the uncommon ones like Jordon and Palestine. However most travel was aloneüòî

Funny enough, I am actually missing London. The place that I had always felt could do with a bit more sunshine. Was lucky to see Buckingham Palace turn into a rainforest on one of the trips. My original work schedule was to visit London in April but of course it didn‚Äôt materialize.

Looking at some of the photos made me wonder when can travel resume. For leisure I am sure it will take a longer time. But for work? What will the ‚Äútravel bubble‚Äù which the government is working on be like? Even when work travel resume, what will going overseas feel like? What are the measures taken by other countries when Singaporeans visit them? So many unknowns, so few answers... Nature is really amazing, in less than 6 months the whole world has changed because of a strain of virus. Who would have guessed that this would happen?

Maybe it‚Äôs a blessing in disguise that people around the world slowed down to appreciate their loved ones and spend more time with their loved ones.

I know I did appreciate the extra time with my two little ones ü•∞
