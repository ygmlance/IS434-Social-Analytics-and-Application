🧂 Just add bath salts + rose petals 🌹

I think I need this 🛀🏻 It might be the last day of the Circuit Breaker but I’m highly unlikely to be back in a pool any time soon, and I don’t have a tub at home.

Throwback image ~ Last time this mini inflatable pool was used was when my baby niece visited last year and we used this as her bath tub.
