Circuit Breaker may have been lifted as #sg enters phase 1 of recovery and a return to normalcy, but not all are released from being trapped in uncertainty, unemployment, and in many parts of the world, institutionalised and systemic racism. (#georgefloyd #blacklivesmatter )

To those struggling in these challenging times, I pray you hold strong and keep your spirits up. Brighter days will soon find and embrace you with the hope of a better, more cheerful tomorrow. 🙏🏿#throwbackthursday
