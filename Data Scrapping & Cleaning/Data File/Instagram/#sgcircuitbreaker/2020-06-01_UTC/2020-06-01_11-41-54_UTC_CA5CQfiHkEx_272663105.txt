Simple ABC Soup

Did you know that ABC soup is call ABC because it contains vitamins A, B & C? To give this nutritious soup more taste and even more vitamins, I choose to add in @liloikanbilis 's Lilo Scallop Powder.

Ingredients:
2 Teaspoon Lilo Scallop Powder
2 Carrots
Half Yellow/White Onion
1 Tomato
Half bowl of Sweet Corn
Sesame oil
1L of water
250g of sliced meat

Steps:
1. Heat up pot with Sesame Oil
2. Put in Carrots and Onion for about 2mins
3. Pour in approx 1L of water
4. Cover and bring to boil
5. Put in Sweet corn and Tomato
6. Bring to boil and put in sliced meat
7. Boil for about 15mins
8. Put in Lilo Scallop Powder and stir
9. Ready to serve!

The reason why I choose Scallop powder instead of using dried scallop is because we usually do not finish the dried scallops used to cook soup, making it really wasteful. By using lilo scallop powder, I get the taste and nutrients without food waste.
