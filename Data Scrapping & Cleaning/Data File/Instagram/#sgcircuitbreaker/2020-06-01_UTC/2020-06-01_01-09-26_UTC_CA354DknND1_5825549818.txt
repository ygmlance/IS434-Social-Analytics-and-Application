Congratulations everyone! 56 days!
.
Today is officially the last day of circuit breaker! Give yourself a pat on the back, for the great effort to abide by the ground rules of CB. It's not easy for all of us. But this day has come. The end of CB!! A new beginning of the new normal begins tomorrow. It might still be the same for most of us, while some of us will start heading back to office.

Lets continue to stay safe, stay healthy.
