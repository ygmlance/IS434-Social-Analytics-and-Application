CB Day #56

Finally! The last day of circuit breaker... Ham and cheese french toast to celebrate (and excuse to clear the fridge. Haha!) ...and the beginning of a new month, June!

Time to form a new (or more) habit(s). Do u have any?

Oh ya, don't rush out 2mrw to jalan jalan yah! Take care and stay safe!
