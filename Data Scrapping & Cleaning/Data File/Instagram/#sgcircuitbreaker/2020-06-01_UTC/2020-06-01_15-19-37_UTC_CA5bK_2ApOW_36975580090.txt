The Covid-19 situation sets us thinking about our lifestyle, family, relationships, and faith.

Being confined at home during the circuit breaker has both good and bad. You spend more time with the family. Kids are happy to see their parents at home, the same for elderly folks who are happy to have their children and grandchildren around. You do things together, like cooking and baking. Small activities with a huge opportunity for bonding.

The downside is that some people cannot stand certain family members, and end up quarrelling. This actually happened within my block.
