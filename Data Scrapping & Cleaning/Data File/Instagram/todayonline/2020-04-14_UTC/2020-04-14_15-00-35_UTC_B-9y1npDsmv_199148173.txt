Many of us are homebound as Singapore battles the Covid-19 outbreak. But staying home doesn’t have to be uneventful or uninspiring. We asked folks to take a minute to observe and share with us what they have discovered about the people they live with. ⁣

@darrenyuenth shared that he has learned that his wife @liezerliezer has a talent for making great desserts: “Despite moving into our new home almost a year ago, we haven't really had the time to cook as much as we would have liked. Work has been busy and we barely have the energy and time to whip up meals at home. With a lot more time now on our hands, I'm discovering that my wife can really bake! She has been making such amazing desserts I'm questioning why we even bother cafe-hopping. We truly should appreciate the small things that we have in our lives. Every time she takes the effort to cook a meal for us, I am truly grateful.” We hope you enjoyed that anecdote and would like to invite you to share yours. It could be a cool talent of your dad’s you never knew about. Tag us in your posts or DM us, and we will share your stories! #StayHomeToday #sgunited #stayhomesg #staysafesg
