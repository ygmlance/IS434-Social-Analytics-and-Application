The nurse from Sengkang General Hospital posted Instagram videos of his neighbour insulting him and his family due to his profession, saying that he has made a police report after the neighbour sprayed disinfectant at his daughter’s face.⁣
⁣
When asked how his daughter was, the man said that she claims to be fine. “But as a nurse and a father, I know she is not,” he said. ⁣
⁣
He stated on Instagram that he had a good relationship with his neighbour in the unit next to his for the past six years.⁣
⁣
However, that stopped when Covid-19 broke out and the neighbours learnt that the nurse and his wife were “frontliners”.⁣
