Like @kissysj said, they are the reason why we have a roof over our head. They are housed in our military facilities due to limited amenities and to prevent them from loitering on the street since they may not understand the bill as much as we do. They are also human beings as well, they have to deal with their emotional stress being so far away from their love ones on top of the impact due to the virus. Put yourself in their shoes, be compassionate and learn not to judge others because of where they are from.",
