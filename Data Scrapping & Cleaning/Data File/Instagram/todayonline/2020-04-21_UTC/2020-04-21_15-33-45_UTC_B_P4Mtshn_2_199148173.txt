Queues at bubble tea shops, coffee houses, pet shops, as well as barbers and hairdressers formed late into the evening of Tuesday (April 21), hours after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the extension of Singapore’s circuit breaker period with the government trimming the list of essential services allowed to continue operating.⁣
⁣
Pet shops, hairdressers and standalone F&B outlets that sell only beverages, packaged snacks, confectioneries or desserts were struck off the list and their closures are effective from 11.59pm Tuesday. ⁣
