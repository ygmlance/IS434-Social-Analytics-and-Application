The Government will extend the circuit breaker for four more weeks until June 1, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on Tuesday (April 21).⁣
⁣
In the next two weeks — until May 4 when the circuit breaker was originally scheduled to end — the authorities will tighten certain measures. “Then, provided we have brought the community numbers down, we can make further adjustments and consider easing some measures,” said Mr Lee, who was speaking in a live telecast on television, radio and the internet.⁣
⁣
Urging all Singaporeans to do their part by staying home, Mr Lee said: “Go out only for essential needs, like buying food or groceries. Otherwise, please stay at home,” he said. “If you do need to go out, then go by yourself, not as a group or as a family.”⁣
