It is always the wrong treatment methods that kill the patients, the correct method will heal without any repercussions! It is nontoxic, cheap,simple and very effective! No expensive ventilators are needed, no mask, no disinfectants, etc. This is the type of treatment the world should go for!

Vaccine IS fit to cure viruses, 1875 fiji measles pandemic, Spanish Influenza flu, SARS,HIV/AIDS, all these pandemics have already been cured by vaccines or a vaccine is almost available for it. Vaccines do include man-made chemicals, but the ground breaker of making vaccines is using previous patient\u2019s antibodies, and testing them out to see how they defeat the pathogens by WBC.

Vaccines are created by a weakened/dead pathogen so that our bodies can develop antibodies to fight the virus and let us be immune to the virus because of the memory cells.

I used Whatsapp to guide a grandma how to use Jessica's nontoxic treatment method to reverse her 3 years old grandson and her H1N1 infection without any medication. All the medicines will impair the immune system and damage the organs. Hence, it is the HIV medicine or the patients'existing ailments plus the equally toxic medicines that kill the infected patients and not COVID 19 . When people use disininfectants hand sanitizers alcohol and soap, the toxic ingredients will also impair the immune system leaving the population more vulnerable to COVID 19 and diseases! It is the wrong preventive and treatment methods that make the population more vulnerable to COVID 19! I don't wear mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide, a cancer causing agent. When the commuters coughed badly, I did not fall sick! I did everything mentioned in the book, Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She reversed all her health problems including infections without any medication or exercise. This brilliant author discovered appropriate cheap food can activate the immune system to fight and subdue infections, pathogens, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells! I posted proofs including a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication. This is the way to fight COVID 19 not using toxic chemicals!
