Many of us are homebound as Singapore battles the Covid-19 outbreak. But staying home doesn‚Äôt have to be uneventful or uninspiring. We asked folks to take a minute to observe and share with us what they have discovered about the people they live with. ‚Å£
‚Å£
@immaskong, for one, didn‚Äôt realise his mum, Mdm Tay, had become quite the whiz at mobile games üéÆ: ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ÄúYears ago, my Mum was not good at handling digital gadgets. To encourage her to be more tech savvy, I introduced her to a mobile game, Hay Day, and she immediately took a liking for it.‚Å£
‚Å£
Since then, she has been actively playing the mobile game. She always tells me this in Mandarin, "I love to decorate my virtual gardens and interact with other players; it makes me feel like I am in the game!" I encourage her to play the game, but in moderation, as it stimulates her brain to stay active.‚Å£
‚Å£
Few days back, while we were having lunch in she received a notification from one of her games. Turned out it was Hay Day.‚Å£
‚Å£
She exclaimed: "Ah! I forgot to feed my poultry!"‚Å£
‚Å£
Feeling curious, I asked: "Are you at level 30 already?"‚Å£
‚Å£
She opened her eyes widely, and said: "30!? I am already at level 82!"‚Å£
‚Å£
I couldn't believe it until I took a glance at her screen stating that she was at level 82. Being a casual player, I saw that she has built her own little virtual "empire" which was no easy feat!‚Å£
‚Å£
She added: "Even though these beautiful gardens are virtual, I feel happy whenever I look at them! When I feel happy, I cook better meals for you too!" I laughed.‚Å£
‚Å£
These are conversations we rarely had in the past. And when we finally have them now, it made me realise how much of my Mum's life that I haven't been keeping up with, and that she has such a flair in gaming!‚Äù‚Å£
