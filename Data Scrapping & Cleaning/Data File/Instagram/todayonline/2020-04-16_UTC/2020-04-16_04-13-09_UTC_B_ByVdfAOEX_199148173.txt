One of the cases was a woman who turned aggressive when NEA’s SG Clean ambassadors asked her to leave the hawker centre at Block 320 Shunfu Road. She was not observing safe distancing when buying food at a stall and went on to eat the food she bought on-site. Refusing to cooperate when told to leave, she took photographs and videos of the ambassadors, doing the same with the police when they arrived to handle the case.
