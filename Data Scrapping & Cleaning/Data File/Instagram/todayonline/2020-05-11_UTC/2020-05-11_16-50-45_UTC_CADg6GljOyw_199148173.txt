The false positive cases were first flagged on Sunday, when the Ministry of Health (MOH) said it had discovered that 33 cases from a laboratory were falsely recorded as positives due to an apparatus calibration issue for one of its test kits.⁣
⁣
Subsequent re-testing confirmed these to be negative cases. There were also two results that had been ambiguous, and were subsequently verified to be negative upon retesting.⁣
⁣
There were no false negative results discovered. The affected laboratory has since stopped all tests and is working to resolve the calibration issue.⁣
