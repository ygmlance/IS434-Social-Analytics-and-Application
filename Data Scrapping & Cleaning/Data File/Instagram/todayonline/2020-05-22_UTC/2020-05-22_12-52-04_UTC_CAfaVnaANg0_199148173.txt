The boy had been shooting water up at the ceiling, but she said that the ceiling was “already cracked even before he did it”.⁣

It said that it has helped the family to clear the debris arising from the spalling concrete, and will be carrying out repair works in the flat on Friday. The public housing authority added that it will bear the cost of repair as it was a rental flat.⁣
