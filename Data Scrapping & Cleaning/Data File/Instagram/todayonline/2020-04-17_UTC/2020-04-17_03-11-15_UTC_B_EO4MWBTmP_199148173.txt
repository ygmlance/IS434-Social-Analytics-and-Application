WATCH: A Raffles Banded Langur seemingly takes a selfie in a video posted by Minister for Social & Family Development @desmond.Lee. The footage from @nparksbuzz captured the critically endangered Langurs using rope bridges between Thomson Nature Park and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. The Nature Park is a key conservation site for Singaporeâ€™s rare native biodiversity and the rope bridges act as canopy linkages to keep wildlife like the Langurs safe from traffic said the minister. #wildlife #langur #animalcrossing #animalvideo #singapore #natureislit
