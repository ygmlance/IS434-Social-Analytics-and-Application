A manager of a dormitory that came under fire on Tuesday (April 21) for locking 20 foreign workers in their room after one of them tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday said the facility had “no choice” but to do so for the safety of some 800 workers living there.

Both the dormitory manager, who wanted to be known only as Mr Thng, and Ms Reena Wong, the design director of the men’s employer V Spec Engineering & Supplies, told @todayonline that the men are no longer locked up, unlike before. 
Ms Wong defended the dormitory's actions on Monday: “Don’t tell me your colleague got virus, you still go and walk around? Cannot be what! For the sake of every man at the dorm, we as an employer told them not to go around. For goodness’ sake, it is only temporary.” #linkinbio for the full story.
