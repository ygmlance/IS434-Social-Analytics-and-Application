When he was diagnosed with Covid-19, the 38-year-old was a Certis quarantine order agent whose role was to go house-to-house and serve quarantine orders to individuals and to assess if their homes were suitable for them to carry out their quarantine order.⁣
⁣
The Ministry of Health reported that he had served quarantine orders on two individuals from Wuhan, China — Cases 13 and 26 — who later tested positive for the virus.⁣
⁣
The father of two, who wanted to be known only as Case 44, was discharged on Feb 18, after 12 days in the hospital — the longest period he has ever spent away from his family.⁣
⁣
“They were ecstatic, they were screaming, ‘Daddy you’re back!’” he said of his children. “I tried to be cool, but the happy tears just fell.” ⁣
