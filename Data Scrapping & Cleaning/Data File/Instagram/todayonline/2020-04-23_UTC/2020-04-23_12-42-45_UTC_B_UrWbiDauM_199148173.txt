Mr Richard Rosales from the Philippines has been quarantined in the Jurong Penjuru Dormitory since work was suspended on April 13. ⁣
He has been using @tiktok.singapore to remain upbeat and document his days in the dorm for his wife and three children back home by posting daily videos. ⁣
“They are worried about me here, about my condition but they feel a little bit relieved when they see my videos and I make them laugh so that’s good,” he said.⁣
