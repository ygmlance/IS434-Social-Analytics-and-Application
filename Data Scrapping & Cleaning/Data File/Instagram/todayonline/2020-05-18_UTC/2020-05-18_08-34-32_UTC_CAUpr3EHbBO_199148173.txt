The Ministry of Health's (MOH) update on Monday (May 18) brings the total number of cases here to 28,343.⁣
⁣
“The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests being processed as one testing laboratory is reviewing its processes following an earlier apparatus calibration issue, and will need time to ramp up its testing capacity,” MOH said.⁣
⁣
The vast majority of the new cases are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories, while 2 cases are Singaporeans or Permanent Residents. ⁣
