Changi Airport will be suspending its Terminal 4 operations from Saturday (May 16) due to the sharp fall in air travel caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.⁣
⁣
This is the second terminal at Changi Airport to be shut in a month, after Terminal 2 was closed on May 1 to bring down running costs and speed up upgrading works there.⁣
⁣
Changi Airport Group said the move will enable it to continue to save on running costs such as utilities and cleaning.⁣
