Alone in her bedroom in a HDB rental flat, Ms Siti Fatimah Awang, a Malaysian who works as a cleaner at a gym in Chai Chee, was waiting for a video call on Sunday (May 24) morning.⁣
⁣
It was a Hari Raya Puasa morning unlike any other for her family.⁣ Her husband, a construction worker who also works here, is not allowed to leave a temporary isolation facility for foreign workers.⁣ Their sons, aged seven and two, are being cared for separately by her sister in Malaysia and a babysitter back home in Malaysia.⁣
⁣
When the family finally had the call that lasted half an hour, Ms Siti Fatimah broke down in her Bukit Merah rental flat.⁣ “I told my husband I’d be strong but when I saw my kids, I couldn’t hide my feelings any longer,” she said. ⁣
