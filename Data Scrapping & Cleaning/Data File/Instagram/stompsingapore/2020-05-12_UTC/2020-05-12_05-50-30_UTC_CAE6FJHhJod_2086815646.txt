From a Stomper: "I was riding along Jurong Gateway Drive yesterday morning (May 11) and this Honda Vezel was going against the traffic on Lane 1. Had I merged into Lane 1 before the bend to enter Westgate, I would have gotten into a head-on collision with the car. Iâ€™ve already lodged a police report. Just want to make sure that people will learn about this as well and have action taken against this dangerous reckless driver."
