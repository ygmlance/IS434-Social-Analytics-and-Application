From Stomper Kim at Block 39 Upper Boon Keng Road on April 19: "Saw two guys chatting and smoking away at the cordoned-off pavilion at 2.05am. They thought no one would see them but GOTCHA!!! They left at 2.40am before the police could arrive to catch and fine them! And by the way, the guy in grey was not wearing a mask." ðŸ˜¡
