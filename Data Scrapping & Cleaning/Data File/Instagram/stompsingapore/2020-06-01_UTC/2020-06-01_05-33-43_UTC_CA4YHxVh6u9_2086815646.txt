From Stomper Cloud: "Spotted this group of youngsters illegally gathering at the multi-storey carpark at Block 88 Tanglin Halt almost every evening during the circuit breaker period. The carpark is not a place for gathering even during normal periods! There should be increased patrolling at this carpark to make sure people aren't flouting the rules. Most importantly, to identify and take action against this group of youngsters because some people just can't abide by the law." ðŸ˜
