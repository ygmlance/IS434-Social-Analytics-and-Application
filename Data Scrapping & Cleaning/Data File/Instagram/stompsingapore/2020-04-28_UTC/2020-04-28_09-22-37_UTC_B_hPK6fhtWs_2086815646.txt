From Stomper Casey: "While I was out cycling last night (Apr 27) along Jurong West Avenue 1 outside Block 492, I was dismayed to see rubbish along a stretch of pavement outside the Japanese restaurant. The rubbish had been left behind by food delivery riders who were waiting to collect their orders. Every evening, there is always a bunch of them smoking and eating away while waiting. These delivery riders should be more mindful and not litter. We are already facing a shortage of essential workers to sweep the streets due to the current circuit breaker period."
