From Stomper Tan in Jurong West: "Was doing food delivery and waiting for an order at the stall. It was very long and mind-draining but gotta suck it up. I was feeling very tired and moody but unexpectedly got a tip from an auntie which was really shocking. Yup, you bet that tip definitely brightened my mood!" ðŸ™Œ
