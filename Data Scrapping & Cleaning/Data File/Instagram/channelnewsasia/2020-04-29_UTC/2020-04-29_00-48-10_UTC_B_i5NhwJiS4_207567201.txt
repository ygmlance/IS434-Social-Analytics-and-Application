Lights, camera, online action! There’s big news in the world of Hollywood – movies that were only released on streaming platforms or video on demand to be eligible for the Oscars next year.

The rule change was, of course, because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has affected a lot of movie releases this year. Usually, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences requires at least a seven-day run in Los Angeles theaters for movies to be eligible.

The news comes right after after the world’s biggest film festivals – which were also affected by COVID-19 – decided to hold a huge 10-day online festival in May instead. Called We Are One: A Global Film Festival, it’ll feature films curated from over 20 festivals around the world, including biggies such as Cannes, Sundance, Berlin, Venice and Toronto film festivals. #Oscars #AcademyAwards #Hollywood #movie #streaming #film #festival #coronavirus #COVID19 (Photo: AFP)
