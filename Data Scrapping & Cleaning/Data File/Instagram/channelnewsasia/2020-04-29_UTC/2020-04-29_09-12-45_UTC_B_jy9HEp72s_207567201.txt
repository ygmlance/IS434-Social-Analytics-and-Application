Irrfan Khan, the legendary Bollywood actor who also appeared in Hollywood movies such as Life Of Pi, Slumdog Millionaire and more, died on Apr 29.

Khan's death, after a prolonged battle with cancer, was confirmed by a spokesman for the actor in a brief statement. In 2018, Khan tweeted he was diagnosed with an endocrine tumour, which affects cells that release hormones into the bloodstream. He was admitted to a Mumbai hospital earlier this week with a colon infection.

The 53-year-old was among the first Indian actors to make a consistent mark in Western cinema, following earlier crossover pioneers like Saeed Jaffrey, Roshan Seth and Om Puri.

Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan was among those who paid tribute on Twitter following Khan's death. "A gracious colleague. A prolific contributor to the world of cinema ... left us too soon creating a huge vacuum." Another well-known director, Karan Johar, said: "Thank you for raising the bar as an artist ... Thank you for enriching our cinema ... We will miss you terribly, Irrfan." #Irrfan Khan #Bollywood #Hollywood #movie #actor #LifeOfPi #SlumdogMillionaire #cancer #RIP (Photo: AFP)
