The truth is out there? The Pentagon recently released three official videos taken by US Navy pilots showing mid-air encounters with what appear to be UFOs.

The grainy black and white footage had previously been leaked and the Navy had acknowledged they were Navy videos. The Department of Defense said Monday it was "releasing the videos in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos". The aerial phenomena remain 'unidentified'," the Pentagon statement said.

One of videos was shot in November 2004 and the other two in January 2015. In one, the weapons sensor operator appears to lose lock on a rapidly moving oblong object which seconds later suddenly accelerates away to the left and out of view. In another video tracking an object above the clouds, one pilot wonders if it is a drone. "My gosh, they're all going against the wind! The wind's 120 knots out of the west!" he said.

In December 2017, the Pentagon acknowledged funding a secret multi-million dollar program to investigate sightings of UFOs, although it said it had ended in 2012. Hmmm, maybe Mulder and Scully were on to somethingâ€¦ #UFO #Pentagon #alien #aliensighting #TheXFiles #conspiracytheory (Photo: Reuters/Pentagon)
