It’s Labour Day today and as a small gesture of thanks to migrant workers, Pizza Hut Singapore said it’s donating 3,000 pizzas to those who’ve been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. “Through this initiative, we would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to the migrant workers for their hard work and contribution to Singapore: THANK You, Stay Safe & Stay Strong!” the company said in a statement.

Pizza Hut has also recently partnered with taxi company ComfortDelGro as a new delivery option. This is to help provide additional income to the drivers during this challenging time. #pizza #PizzaHut #Singapore #migrantworkers #LabourDay #May1 #thankyou (Photo: Instagram/pizzahut_sg)
