Jerry Stiller, who played two of television's most cantankerous fathers on the sitcoms Seinfeld and The King Of Queens, has died aged 92 of natural causes. His son, comedian Ben Stiller, announced the news on Twitter on May 11.

Stiller was part of a 1960s comedy team with wife Anne Meara, but he was in his mid-60s when he got what would become his signature acting role: Frank Costanza, father of George Costanza on Seinfeld. He later appeared in The Queen Of Queens as Arthur Spooner, another oddball who lived in the basement of the home of his daughter and her husband.
