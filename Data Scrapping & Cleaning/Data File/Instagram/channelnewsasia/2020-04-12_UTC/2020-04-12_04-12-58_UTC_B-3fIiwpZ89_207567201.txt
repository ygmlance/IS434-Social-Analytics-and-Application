Introducing Sharon Ngiam, founder of one-year-old clothing company Beddoni (@beddoniofficial), which specialises in oh-so-cute pyjama sets and home-wear for (working) mums and kids. The best part? Some of the adult pyjama tops are presentable enough to take Zoom meetings in! “I really do want to encourage a habit for my kids of wearing simple, satisfying pyjamas. There aren’t many brands out there that offer an elegant product line for mothers and children to bond over and relax in,” she told CNA Lifestyle. #Singapore #mum #mums #motherhood #entrepreneur #mumpreneur #supportlocal #wfh #stayhome #stayhealthy #Zoom #Zoommeeting #pyjamas #CNAlifestyle (Pic: Beddoni)
