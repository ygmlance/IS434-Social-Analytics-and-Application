When it comes to helping out in a pandemic crisis, every little step counts – and retired army captain Tom Moore is literally doing that in his garden.

The 99-year-old war veteran has become a celebrity by raising at least £6.4 million for Britain's health service with a walk around his garden during the COVID-19 crisis.

Captain Tom, who has used a walking frame to move around since breaking his hip, has set himself the target of walking the 25m around his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday later this month.

The story has lifted the hearts of a nation stuck in lockdown for the last month and weary of the relentless wave of grim news. Moore had originally aimed to raise £500,000 but that target has been smashed as media attention from around the globe has zoomed in on his garden in Bedfordshire, central England.

His son-in-law Colin Ingram said Moore wanted to give something back after receiving such good care from the state-run National Health Service (NHS) when he broke his hip two years ago and in subsequent hospital visits. "We said we'd give him a pound a lap, and thank goodness I didn't say I'd match any money he raised,” quipped Ingram.

Raising money for the NHS has given Moore a new lease of life and the veteran has no plans to stop, even though he is due to hit his 100-lap target on Thursday morning. Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #CaptainTom #walking #fundraising #coronavirus #COVID19 #inspiration (Photo: Reuters)
