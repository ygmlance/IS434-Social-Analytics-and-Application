This weekend might be a good time to clean the house. Actually, you might want to take it a step further by disinfecting.

Wiping the shelves and the TV console with a cloth dampened with just water isn't enough to kill the coronavirus. You'll need a cleaning agent that effectively kills bacteria, viruses and fungi (read the label because not all can do all three). To make it more effective, let the liquid dry off on its own, and target these high-touch areas: Doorknobs, table surfaces, hard dining chairs (seat, back, and arms), kitchen and bathroom counters, taps, toilets (seats and flush handles), light switches, TV remote controls, and game controllers.
