PSA: It’s now mandatory to wear a mask when stepping out of the house.

Singapore’s Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong made the announcement on Apr 14. Individuals who are caught refusing to wear a mask will be fined S$300 on their first offence, while those who flout the rule a second time will be fined S$1,000.

Foreign residents caught breaching these rules might have their work passes or permanent resident status revoked.

There are some exemptions: Children below the age of two don’t need to, and adults who are exercising (running and jogging) only need to put once they stop.

But that begs the question – how do you clean your reusable cloth masks? Experts say you should wash it as often as you wash your underwear, meaning after every use. You should also boil it in water once in a while.
