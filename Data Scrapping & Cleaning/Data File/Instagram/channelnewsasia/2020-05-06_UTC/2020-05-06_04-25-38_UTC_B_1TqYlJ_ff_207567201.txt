Harry Potter reading a Harry Potter book? Yes, it’s happening. Daniel Radcliffe is reading Harry Potter And The Sorcerer’s Stone for an audiobook.

The collaboration is part of an initiative by JK Rowling and her company Wizarding World, and each chapter of the book will be read out by a different celebrity each week. Radcliffe kicks things off with the first chapter. Fantastic Beasts actor Eddie Redmayne is on the list, as well as Noma Dumezweni, who is part of the Harry Potter And The Cursed Child play.

Other big names like David Beckham and Dakota Fanning are also lending their voices to the project, and original audiobook narrator Stephen Fry is returning too.

The audio recordings can be found on Spotify and Spotify Kids, while video recordings will also be made available on the Harry Potter At Home app, which Rowling launched as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. #HarryPotter #DanielRadcliffe #JKRowling #book #audiobook #EddieRedmayne #FantasticBeasts
