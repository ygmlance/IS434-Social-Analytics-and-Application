They were supposed to help save the day. Instead, it’s back to the drawing board for the Virus Vanguard, Singapore’s anti-COVID-19 superhero team.

The five-member fictional team made its debut on the Gov.sg website on Apr 21 but was taken down less than a day, with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) saying it’s “undergoing a review” after receiving a lot of feedback about the characters.

Virus Vanguard was a collaboration between Gov.sg and art collective Band of Doodlers. The plan was to create a comic series to convey the different aspects of the "circuit breaker" measures aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. But some characters were criticised for too much levity while others felt the emphasis could have been on healthcare workers.

But one character drew much of the flak – MAWA Man, a Manchester United-supporting character who really doesn’t like Liverpool FC. The name, Must Always Walk Alone, was a jibe at the latter’s motto You’ll Never Walk Alone. An online petition by LFC supporters to withdraw the character received more than 500 signatures.

Band Of Doodlers founder Mas Shafreen has apologised, saying the characters “came across insensitive… A group of us, including myself, wanted to create superhero characters to show appreciation for our frontliners, including healthcare workers, and how we can battle this together.” Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #VirusVanguard #superhero #MAWA #YNWA #LFC #coronavirus #COVID19 (Photo: Gov.sg)
