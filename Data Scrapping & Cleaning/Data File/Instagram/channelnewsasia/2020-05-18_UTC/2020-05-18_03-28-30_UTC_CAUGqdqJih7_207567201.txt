Thanks to the Netflix documentary The Last Dance, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls are in vogue at the moment. And to coincide with the show, as well as the 35th anniversary of the Air Jordan brand, Sotheby’s recently auctioned off the NBA legend’s autographed match-worn sneakers from his rookie season – which fetched US$560,000 (S$798,000). The Air Jordan 1s was designed by Nike for Jordan in 1985 and is considered the first ever signature sneakers. Fun fact: Like most of Jordan's basketball shoes, they are a mismatched pair in a size 13 (left) and size 13.5 (right).
