Ever wondered what happens to all that wood from trees that have been cut down or pruned in Singapore?

Well, some of these find themselves in people’s homes as sustainably crafted furniture, courtesy of the local brand Arthur Zaaro. 
Run by American carpenter Aaron Arthur Foeste, who is married to a Singaporean and has made the Lion City his home, the company custom-makes bars, tables and other made-to-order items.

The wood used come from trees that were cut down by local contractors during landscaping work (and not deforestation, he emphasised). And nothing goes to waste – extra scraps are given away to jewellery makers and knife handle carvers, and even a guy who raises beetles regularly ask for leftover sawdust.
