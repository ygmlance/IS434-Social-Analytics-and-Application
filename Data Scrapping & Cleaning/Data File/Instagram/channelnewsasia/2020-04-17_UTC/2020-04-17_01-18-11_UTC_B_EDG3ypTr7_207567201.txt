Everyone’s working from home – and that includes a famous street artist like Banksy.

Unable to go out and spray on walls, he’s taken to creating a new artwork in his bathroom. He recently posted a photo on his Instagram account with the quip: “My wife hates it when I work from home.” It features his trademark stenciled rats running amok around the sink and toilet.

The big question is – does he still wear a mask at home? #Banksy #workfromhome #streetart #artist #graffiti #coronavirus #COVID19 (Photos: Instagram/Banksy)
