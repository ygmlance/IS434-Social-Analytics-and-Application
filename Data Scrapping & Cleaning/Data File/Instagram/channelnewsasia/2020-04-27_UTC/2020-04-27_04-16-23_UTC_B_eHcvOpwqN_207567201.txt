Congratulations! Sheila Sim has just announced that she’s four months pregnant with a baby girl. The 35-year-old model-turned actress and her banker husband, 39-year-old Deon Woo, have always wanted a daughter, and they’re over the moon.

After tying the knot in early 2018, Sim had been upfront in interviews about wanting to become a mum, but when that didn’t happen right away, “we went to see fertility doctors.” That was when “I realised I had fibroids in my womb – and there were a lot of them.” In September last year, she underwent an operation to remove the fibroids.

Not long after the operation, within a period of five months, a home pregnancy test turned up positive. Read our interview with Sheila on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #SheilaSim #pregnant #baby #Singapore #actress #motherhood (Photo: The Celebrity Agency)
