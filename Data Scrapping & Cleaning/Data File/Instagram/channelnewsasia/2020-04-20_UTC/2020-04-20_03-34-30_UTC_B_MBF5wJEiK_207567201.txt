Before she was a radio DJ and mummy influencer, Jamie Yeo was Tammy Tay in Growing Up.

We recently had a chat with her, where she shared what it was like being in the Channel 5 nostalgia drama series – and it turns out those were tumultuous times. “We had our problems. It was just that there were different cliques within the cast,” she revealed.

While Jamie says she wasn’t the cause of the on-set conflicts in Singapore’s most famous polyester-wearing family, she did admit to becoming “quite a diva. I wish I could do things differently. After a couple of years on the show, I was like, ‘Yeah, I don’t really want to do this… I don’t want to wear scratchy 70s clothes and have my hair hair-sprayed to death.’” Juicy enough for you?
