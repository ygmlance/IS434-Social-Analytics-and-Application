UK's Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Prince William and his wife Kate, celebrated her fifth birthday on Saturday (May 2). And to mark the occasion, a handful of photographs were released to show what she's been doing during lockdown.

And apparently, she's being very charitable. The photographs were taken last month by her mother at the Sandringham Estate in eastern England, where the family helped to pack and deliver food parcels for isolated pensioners in the local area. #PrincessCharlotte #royalfamily #PrinceWilliam #KateMiddleton #lockdown #COVID19 #coronavirus (Photos: Reuters)
