Good news for IKEA-loving Westies – it’s opening a new outlet at Jem in 2021.

It’ll be the third one in Singapore – after Alexandra and Tampines – but unlike those two, it’s a small-store concept, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia.

The 6,500 square metre IKEA will span three floors in the shopping mall and will be more streamlined. There’s no playground or built-in warehouse but thankfully, it’ll have a restaurant that will serve your favourite meatballs, chicken wings and sustainable seafood.
