Right now, going to Sentosa isn’t an option. You can’t hang out at the beach or ride the luge right now – unless you’re playing Animal Crossing, of course.

The virtual version of Singapore’s famous recreational island has been open for a couple of days on the popular Nintendo Switch game. All you need to do is register for one of the 36 free slots each day to be able to check out everything from the beach bars to a spot for some yoga.

Sentosa Crossing is open in three two-hour slots every day, from 10am to noon, 2pm to 4pm, and 6pm to 8pm. Each two-hour window will have three sessions of 30mins each, and each session will allow up to four visitors.
