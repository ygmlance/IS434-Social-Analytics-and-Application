It’s May 11 and we all know what that means – McDonald’s Singapore is finally open again. Or at least most of its restaurants – and only for deliveries, drive-through services and takeaways.

After a three-week absence, it’s now taking orders. But there are some caveats: Most will be open from 7am to 9pm, and those located in parks, tourist attractions and some institutions will remain closed. It will also not be offering 24-hour service and its dessert kiosks and McCafe counters will remain closed due to the “circuit breaker” rules. But we’ll take it!
