For couples staying together, the current stay-at-home situation might seem like the perfect romantic scenario. Unfortunately, many may not have experienced living together for extended periods such as what weâ€™re experiencing right now.

From the heightened anxiety because of the pandemic, to the shrinking of personal space and personal time, to deep-seated and unresolved issues floating around, it's not surprising for people to develop cabin fever relationship-wise.

The first thing to do is make sure you have a bit of personal time in, hopefully, your own personal space. You don't have to spend every single minute together.
