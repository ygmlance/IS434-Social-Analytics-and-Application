McDonald's Singapore will suspend restaurant operations in all its outlets from Apr 19 until the end of the "circuit breaker" period.

In a press release, it said: "McDonald’s Singapore today announced it has been advised by the Ministry of Health that as a preventative action in the fight against COVID-19 in Singapore, it is suspending restaurant operations, including McDelivery and Drive-Thru, till May 4." This move - which includes drive-through and delivery services - went into effect from 11am Sunday, and comes a day after the fast food chain announced the suspension of takeaways.

In announcing its previous move to suspend takeaways, the company said that it would continue to pay salaries of employees, including seniors, whose roles will be disrupted during this period. There are seven McDonald's employees infected with COVID-19 to date. #McDonalds #Singapore #fastfood #circuitbreaker #coronavirus #COVID19
