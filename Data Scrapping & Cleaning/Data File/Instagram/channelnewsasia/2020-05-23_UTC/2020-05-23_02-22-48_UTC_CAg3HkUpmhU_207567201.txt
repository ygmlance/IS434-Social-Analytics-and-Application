Uggie, the Jack Russell whose antics in Oscar-winning film The Artist stole viewers' hearts, was crowned Palm Dog of Palm Dogs on Friday, singled out as the best canine winner in the award's 20-year history at Cannes, France.

This year's Palm Dog jury, composed of leading film critics, concluded Uggie had given the ultimate big screen performance by a dog of the last two decades.

Uggie, who in 2011 won the Palm Dog award, died in 2015 aged 13. He hit the big time after starring as French actor Jean Dujardin's cute sidekick in the black and white film, which tells of a silent star whose career dives as talking pictures take over Hollywood.

He also became the first dog to leave his prints beside the likes of Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable in front of Hollywoodâ€™s Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and appeared on television chat shows as well as attending the Golden Globes and Oscar ceremonies.
