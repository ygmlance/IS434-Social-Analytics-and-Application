Basketball great Michael Jordan voiced outrage on Sunday (May 31) over the death of George Floyd, an incident that has triggered violent nationwide protests in the United States.

Jordan said his heart went out to the family of Floyd and others who have died through acts of racism. "I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry," Jordan, a Basketball Hall of Famer and owner of the National Basketball Association's Charlotte Hornets, said in a statement.

He continued: "I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of colour in our country. We have had enough." Jordan, a six-time NBA champion who was at the heart of the Chicago Bulls' dynasty in the 1990s, also called on people to show compassion and empathy and never turn their backs on senseless brutality.

He said: “We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all.” #MichaelJordan #GeorgeFloyd (Photo: Screengrab from The Last Dance)
