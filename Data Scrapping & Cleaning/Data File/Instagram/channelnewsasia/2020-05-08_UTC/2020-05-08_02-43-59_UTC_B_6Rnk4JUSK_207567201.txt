If you or your kids are getting a little bored with the daily “dabao” meal in its plastic takeaway container or brown paper packet, why not a little fun with your food?

Chef LG Han of Labyrinth gave us a quick crash course on plating three popular hawker food that’s guaranteed to put a smile on faces.

And yes, nasi biryani is already yummy – but it can’t hold a candle to “nasi bear-yani”, right?
