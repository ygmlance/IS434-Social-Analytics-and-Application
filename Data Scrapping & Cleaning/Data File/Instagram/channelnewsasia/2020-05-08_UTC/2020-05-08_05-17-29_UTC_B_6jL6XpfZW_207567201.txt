Last night, a number of Singapore landmarks turned blue. It’s part of #SeeItBlue, a campaign to highlight the importance of mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to thank key workers on the frontline.

The campaign will run every Thursday at 8pm until the end of the “circuit breaker” period on June 1. Among the venues involved are: ArtScience Museum, Cavanagh Bridge, Esplanade, Fullerton Hotel, Gardens by the Bay, Helix Bridge, ION Orchard, Marina Bay Sands, National Gallery Singapore, Raffles Hotel Singapore, Sentosa, The Arts House, Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall. 
It’s part of the global #MakeItBlue campaign, which started in the UK and is currently in 17 countries. Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio.#Singapore #landmarks #SeeItBlue #MakeItBlue (Photos: Tan Chin Fan)
