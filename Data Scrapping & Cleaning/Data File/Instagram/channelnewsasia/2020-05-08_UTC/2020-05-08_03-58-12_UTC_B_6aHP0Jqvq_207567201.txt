If you thought Daniel Radcliffe reading a chapter from a Harry Potter book was cool, how about having Gollum narrate the entire The Hobbit?

Andy Serkis announced he will be doing The Hobbitathon Live, essentially a 12-hour marathon reading of the entire The Hobbit novel. It’s a fundraising effort for two charities: UK’s National Health Services and Best Beginnings, which works to support babies, toddlers, pregnant families and new parents and to help reduce inequalities.

The reading will commence on May 8, 6pm Singapore time. You can follow the livestream link on the GoFundMe page he has set up as well as on his Twitter page. Find out more on CNA Lifesssstyle, link in biossesss… #Hobbit #AndySerkis #Gollum #charity (Photo: AFP)
