The four local celebs put together a short video clip where they sang a tune to remind everyone not to go out. Well, technically, it's the four of them harmonising the phrase "Stay at home", but you get the idea. In the clip posted on Chuaâ€™s Instagram (@chua.tanya), Chua is seen playing with her pet cat, while Lin does the entire piece using a wheel-roller and working out! #StayAtHome #TanyaChua #JJLin #StefanieSun #KitChan #Singapore #music #celebrity #CNAlifestyle (Pic: Instagram/chua.tanya)
