Is it possible to juggle the roles of mother, wife, daughter and daughter-in-law and still succeed in being true to oneself? CNA Lifestyle recently had a chat with Joanne Peh who shared her secrets.

For starters, the actress admitted she didn’t realise motherhood was a “double-edged sword.” “Children bring you a lot of joy – but they can also bring you a lot of stress and a lot of not-so-nice emotions as well. It’s very important that we are healthy emotionally and physically. Keeping up with children is one thing, but I think if you’re a happy person, it affects the whole family,” she said.

Navigating multiple roles begins with mums taking care of themselves – and not being shy to ask for help when needed. “I think it’s very important to have a network of help. I’m one of those people who think it’s important to have my own interests and my own life – so it’s not just all about the kids. Because who I am outside will affect how I parent and how I am to my kids.” Read our interview on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #JoannePeh #motherhood #lifelessons #parenting #women (Photo: Phin Wong)
