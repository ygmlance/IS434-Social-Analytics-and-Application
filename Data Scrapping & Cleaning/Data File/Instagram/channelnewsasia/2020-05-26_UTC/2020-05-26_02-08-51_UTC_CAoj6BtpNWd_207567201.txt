It hasn’t been a good month for Brian May. The legendary Queen guitarist recently revealed he had suffered a minor heart attack – in the middle of dealing with another injury involving his backside.

May took to Instagram to share his experiences. Earlier this month, he had injured his buttocks while gardening and went for an MRI scan that revealed he had a compressed sciatic nerve. “In the middle of the whole saga of the painful backside I had a small heart attack. I actually turned out to have three arteries which were congested and in danger of blocking the supply of blood to my heart,” he said.

May, who thought he was a healthy person, had no idea how dangerous things were for him. “Nothing could tell me that I was about to be in real, real trouble, because I could have died from that, from the blockages that were there,” he said. Luckily, he’s safe now after undergoing an operation and is “ready to rock”. Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #BrianMay #Queen #heartattack #health #music (Photo: Reuters)
