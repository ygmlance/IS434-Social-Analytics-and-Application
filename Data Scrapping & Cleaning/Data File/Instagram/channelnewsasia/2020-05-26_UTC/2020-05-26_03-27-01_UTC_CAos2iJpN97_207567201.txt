Looking for matching outfits with your doggo? K-pop group GOT7’s Youngjae has come out with a new clothing line featuring his pet dog Coco.

The collection, called Ars x Coco, will be available until Jun 8, with merchandise available for both pet owners and their furkids. These include hoodies, T-shirts, tote bags and caps for humans – as well as T-shirts, leashes, a dog bowl and even a dog tumbler for furkids. Part of the proceeds from sales will be donated to animal shelters and advocacy organisations.
