It’s jokingly called an “uncle” accessory but everyone uses it whenever their nose is blocked.

Just make sure you don’t use it all the time because there are side-effects to these tubes of camphor, menthol and eucalyptus oil concoction – ironically, these can be responsible for persistent nose congestion. Excessive use can also cause dizziness, hallucinations and even seizures.

And while these aren’t technically addictive, overusing these can be a bad habit – one doctor recalled a patient who had been continuously using nasal inhalers for five years and it took two months to wean her out of it. The safest bet is to use an inhaler no more than three times a day – and don’t use it for longer than one to two weeks.
