When hawker Melvin Chew heard Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s first “circuit breaker” announcement in early April, he knew he had to do something for his fellow hawkers. “I foresaw that many hawkers who are used to relying on walk-in customers will now need help to promote their stalls on social media," said the second-gen owner of Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck & Kway Chap stall at Chinatown Complex Food Centre.

Most hawkers aren’t on conventional delivery services such as Grab, Food Panda and Deliveroo – and many don’t even have any social media accounts. The result was the Facebook group Hawkers United – Dabao 2020, which allows hawkers to promote their food and arrange for takeaway or delivery. Since it was set up, the group has had more than 200,000 members, hawkers and patrons alike.

It’s proven so popular that spin-off groups have also been launched, such as Pasar United (for retailers) and Delivery United (for delivery folks). There’s also a Hawkers United Singapore website that groups hawker stalls based on different geographical areas to make things even easier for everyone.
