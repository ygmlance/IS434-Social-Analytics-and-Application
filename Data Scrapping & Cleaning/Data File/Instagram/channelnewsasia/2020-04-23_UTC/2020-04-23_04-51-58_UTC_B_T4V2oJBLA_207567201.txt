As humans stay indoors, nature is finding a way to make its presence felt in Thailand. A couple of days ago, there was news of rare leatherback sea turtles nesting in tourist-free beaches â€“ the largest number of nests in two decades.

And recently, aerial images were released showing a herd of more than 30 dugongs, which are classified as a vulnerable specie, drifting peacefully off the coast of Libong island.
