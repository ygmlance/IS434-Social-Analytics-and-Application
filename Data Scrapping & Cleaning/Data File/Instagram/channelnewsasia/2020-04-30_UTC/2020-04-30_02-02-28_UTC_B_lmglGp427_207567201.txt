Parents with children born in April and May during the “circuit breaker” period have a dilemma – how do you celebrate your child’s birthday? Juwel (Nyla) Ang decided the best way was to give her two-year-old daughter the gift of a lifetime on Apr 10. She created a charity initiative to help low-income Singaporean families with children – and named it after her.

Amelia’s Rainbow Fund was launched on Apr 9 and in nine days it raised S$29,416 – which went into assembling care kits with food, board games, vouchers and health items. These were distributed to 150 families in the Bukit Merah and lower Henderson areas. “Sometimes we tend to have the impression that everyone in Singapore is taken care of. But to be honest, a lot of them are really struggling right now, especially those who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19. So I think it’s nice to do whatever we can to help out,” said Ang.

And while Ang said her daughters (she’s got two more) may be too young to understand, she’ll continue to lead by example. “I started it as a gift for (Amelia). If one day they decide to embrace giving, I will be glad to help them with the first step.” Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #AmeliasRainbowFund #Singapore #charity #family #bestgiftever #fundraising #birthdaygift #inspiration #mothers #parentingskills #circuitbreaker (Photos: Juwel Ang)
