Rishi Kapoor, one of India's most loved film actors, best known for his romantic roles, has died. He was 67.

The actor passed away on Thursday (Apr 30), a day after the disappearance of another Indian star, Irrfan Khan. Kapoor was admitted to a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday. "He is suffering from cancer and he has some breathing problem, so he has been admitted to the hospital," his brother Randhir told Indian media on Wednesday.

Kapoor was first diagnosed with cancer in 2018, and received treatment initially in the US, before returning to India late in 2019. He has been hospitalized in India several times since with a variety of complications.

Despite his health problems, Kapoor recently announced that he would co-star with Deepika Padukone in a remake of Hollywood hit The Intern. But his regular social media activity has gone quiet since the beginning of April. His most recent on-screen appearance was in Bollywood comedy 102 Not Out, opposite his regular screen partner Amitabh Bachchan. #RishiKapoor #Bollywood #movie #actor (Photo: AFP)
