One of the world's largest lunar meteorites is going on private sale at Christie’s and it’s valued at £2 million (US$2.49 million). The moon rock, weighing over 13.5 kg, was probably struck off the surface of the moon by a collision with an asteroid or comet and then showered down on the Sahara desert. Called the NWA 12591, it’s thought to be the fifth largest piece of the moon ever found on earth (it’s about the size of an American football). There is just 650kg of moon rock known to be on earth.

Like many meteorites that are discovered, it was found in the Sahara by an anonymous finder, then changed hands. Scientists confirmed it’s legit after comparing it with rock samples brought back from the Apollo space missions in the 1960s and 1970s. #moon #meteorite #moonrock #forsale #Christies (Photo: Reuters)
