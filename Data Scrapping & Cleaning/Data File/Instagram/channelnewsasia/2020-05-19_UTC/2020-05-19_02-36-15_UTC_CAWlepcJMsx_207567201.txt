Twenty years after leaving the group, Robbie Williams will be taking back his spot in Take That – but only for an online concert for charity, which will take place on May 29.

He’ll be joining Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald for a benefit show for music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins and Crew Nation, which provide support for concert crew members during the pandemic outbreak. No word yet on whether Jason Orange will also be re-joining his old group.

The concert will be hosted on the Compare The Meerkat YouTube and Facebook pages. Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #RobbieWilliams #TakeThat #concert #charity #music #boyband #GaryBarlow #MarkOwen #HowardDonald #JasonOrange #coronavirus #COVID19 (Photo: Reuters)
