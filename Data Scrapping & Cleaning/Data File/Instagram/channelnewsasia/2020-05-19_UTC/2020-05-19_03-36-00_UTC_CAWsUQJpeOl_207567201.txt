There was a battle of epic proportions going on in the background, but Filipino reporter Doris Bigornia was committed to doing her job on live national television.

The amusing video of a catfight between Bigornia’s two cats – Bella and Nala – which happened right behind her, took place last week. And admirably, she continued reporting, with only the occasional side-glance at her naughty pets. She shared the clip of the incident on her Twitter page, writing: “Children!!! There is a law in the studio!” The video clip has gone viral with more than two million views.

Room Rater, a Twitter account that rates Skype rooms and Zoom rooms, joked in a tweet: “The room is an 8. The cat fight is 10/10.” Meanwhile, another user wrote: “The cat fight was more entertaining than “Cats” the movie. Cat fight: 10/10. “Cats” the movie: 0/10.” Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #catfight #catsofInstagram #cats #Philippines #television (Photo: Twitter/Doris Bigornia)
