Imagine a “zoo” where the tables are turned – animals get to roam around while humans stay “locked up” in the comfiest way possible. That’s the idea behind a new eco-resort that’s set to open in Guangdong in 2022.

It’s called Worldwild China and its designer, Bill Bensley, envisioned it as a place where visitors can have views of a wildlife sanctuary where rescued endangered animals roam free.

Seven hotels will be spread across three zones representing the continents of Asia, Africa and Australia. As for the animals, Bensley said: “It is my dream that the mistreated animals of overpopulated zoos in China could run free there. We are reassigning non-predator animals from Chinese roadside zoos to create an ecosystem where they can all thrive.” Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #ecoresort #zoo #China #WorldwildChina #endangered #rescued #animals #wildlife (Photos: Bensley)
