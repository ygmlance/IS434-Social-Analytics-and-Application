If you've been jogging or cycling at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, you might have come across an unusual sight. SPOT is a robodog that reminds people to keep to safe distancing measures and she made her debut on May 8 as part of a two-week pilot trial conducted by NParks and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group.

SPOT will be deployed along a 3km stretch in the River Plains section of the park during off-peak hours. As well as broadcasting messages (the voice is female, in case you're wondering) reminding visitors of social distancing measures, SPOT is fitted with cameras and analytics tools to estimate the number of people in the park. These cameras will not be able to track or recognise specific individuals, and no personal data will be collected, said the authorities. The robot, built by Boston Dynamics, is controlled remotely but accompanied by at least one NParks officer.

Should the pilot prove successful, NParks will consider deploying the robot during the morning and evening peak hours, and also study plans to send SPOT to other parks such as Jurong Lake Gardens. SPOT is also being trialled at the a COVID-19 community isolation facility at Changi Exhibition Centre, to deliver essential items such as medicine to patients. #robodog #Singapore #SPOT #safedistancing #exercise #cycling #jogging #park (Photos: AFP, Reuters)
