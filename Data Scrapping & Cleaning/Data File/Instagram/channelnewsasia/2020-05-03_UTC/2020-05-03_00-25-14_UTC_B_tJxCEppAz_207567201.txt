With everyone stuck at home, it might not seem like the perfect time to socialise. But with everyone virtually connected and social norms undergoing a huge change, it might actually a good time to say hello to a former friend you've lost in touch with.

Although moments of reconnection can be powerful, we often miss out on them. The mere thought of reaching out can make us uncomfortable, ie, there's a "reason" you haven't talked. But in most cases, it's because we get busy, we change jobs, we move. We didn’t mean to fall out of touch. In one study, many people felt anxious before reconnecting, but 90 per cent reported afterward that it was fun and enjoyable.

And you've got an excuse now. “People think it will be awkward or unwanted if they pick up the phone and call an old friend they haven’t spoken to in years,” Dan Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, said. “But in this time of crisis, reaching out is even easier because there is a very natural opener: Calling to see if you and your family are okay?” Read more about why you should message your long-lost friend on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #friends #reconnect #relationship #advice #lifelessons #stayconnected (Photo: Pexels)
