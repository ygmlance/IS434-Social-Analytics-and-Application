There are so many types of exercise videos to follow online, from yoga and pilates to simple bodyweight exercises.

One health expert that CNA Lifestyle talked to said that with the rise of home workouts on social media nowadays, fitness personalities are levelling up to capture more eyeballs, but might be dangerous to follow.
