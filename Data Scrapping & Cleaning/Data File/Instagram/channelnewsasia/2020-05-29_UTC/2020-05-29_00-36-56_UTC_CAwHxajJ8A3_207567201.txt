Travel plans have been disrupted this year, but that hasn’t stopped Singaporeans from dreaming about their next destination once it’s safe to do so. And, no surprises, Japan is on top of their wishful thinking list.

Expedia recently released data on what people have been searching for last month and three places in the country were on the Top 10 list for the coming months of October to December. The destinations were, in this order: Tokyo, Taipei, Bangkok, Seoul, Maldives, Bali, Phuket, Osaka, Hokkaido and Hong Kong.

When it comes to top destinations Singaporeans are hopefully looking at for Jan to Feb 2021, Tokyo came in first again, followed by Maldives, Bangkok, Niseko, Seoul, Bali, Taipei, Johor, Sapporo, and Okinawa.
