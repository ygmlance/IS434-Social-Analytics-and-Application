The popular K-pop girl group BLACKPINK has a new (unofficial) member. At least for one song – according to Lady Gaga.

In an interview with the Japanese entertainment portal TVGroove, the pop star talked about Sour Candy, the track she co-wrote with BLACKPINK that appears in her album Chromatica. “I’m proud to be the fifth member,” she said.

Gaga added: “It was a really exciting collaboration. I wanted to celebrate them because I love powerful women like them, and they also wanted to celebrate me as well. We had a great time together with this song. I was excited to hear them interpret the song in Korean. It ended up being very creative and fun. I was in awe when I heard their singing voice.” We’re very sure both Blinks and Little Monsters are very happy right now. #LadyGaga #BLACKPINK #SourCandy #Chromatica #Kpop #music #Blinks #LittleMonsters #Lisa #Jennie #Rose #Jisoo (Photos: Reuters, YouTube/BLACKPINK)
