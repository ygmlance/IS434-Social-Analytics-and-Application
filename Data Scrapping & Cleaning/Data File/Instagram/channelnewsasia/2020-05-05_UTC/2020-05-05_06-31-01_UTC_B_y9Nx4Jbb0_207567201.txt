Many K-pop fans have probably been wondering about BLACKPINK’s long break from the spotlight. But the group’s agency YG Entertainment has now announced that the quartet will be back in June.

The statement was in response to earlier reports that the group had finished recording a new album and was gearing up to film a new music video. It will be their first release since the hit song Kill This Love way back in April 2019. The music video for that one has had more than 816 million views on YouTube to date.

Recently, there was also news that the group was collaborating with Lady Gaga on a track for the latter’s upcoming album Chromatica. Read more in CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #BLACKPINK #Kpop #music #KillThisLove #Jennie #Lisa #Rose #Jisoo (Photo: AFP)
