Looks like the #releasethesnydercut online campaign actually worked. Director Zack Snyder’s mysterious version of Justice League will now finally be shown on HBO Max in 2021.

The back story: Snyder, who directed Man Of Steel and Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, was working on the movie but had to step back after his daughter died by suicide. Joss Whedon was then brought in to complete the film, which was eventually released in Nov 2017.

But fans, and even some of the actors, started clamouring for the studio to release Snyder’s version, which was only “one-fourth” of what he did. Snyder says he will be calling on much of their original post-production crew to help score, cut and add or finish visual effects, and possibly bring in some of the original actors to record new voice lines. #JusticeLeague #ReleaseTheSnyderCut #ZackSnyder #DC #Hollywood #movie #ManOfSteel #BatmanVSuperman #DawnOfJustice (Photo: Justice League)
