Canadian rocker Bryan Adams has recently apologised after a backlash and accusations of anti-Chinese racism over his online rant about the pandemic forcing the cancellation of his London shows this week.

The Please Forgive Me and Cuts Like A Knife singer issued a statement offering "apologies to any and all that took offence to my posting yesterday‚Äù and added: "I have love for all people." Adams had said in earlier expletive-laced Twitter and Instagram posts that his gigs at the Royal Albert Hall were nixed thanks to "bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy bastards." He also admonished the Chinese to go vegan.

While animal rights groups praised his call to stop eating meat, others interpreted the expletive-laced comments as anti-Chinese. In his apology, Adams explained: "No excuse, I just wanted to have a rant about the horrible animal cruelty in these wet markets being the possible source of the virus, and promote veganism."
