As any pet owner will tell you, having a furkid to keep you company at home during the circuit breaker period definitely helps. And for most animals, your daily presence is much appreciated too.

When it comes to cats, however, it can go either way. Since they’re used to being left alone, suddenly having someone there all the time (or an entire family), with all that noise and movement, might actually be stressful for some. Try to make sure they have a quiet space to retreat to and don’t overwhelm them with kisses and hugs.
