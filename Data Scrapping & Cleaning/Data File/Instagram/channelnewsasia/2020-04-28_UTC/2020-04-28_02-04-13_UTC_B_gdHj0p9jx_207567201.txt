Some people do yoga, others cook. But for one bored Hungarian couple in lockdown, the best way to spend the time is to recreate scenes from their favourite movies and TV shows – using anything they can find at home.

Film buffs Norbert Hosszu and Fanni Kovacs’ hilarious photos have gone viral on social media, with scenes ranging from The Lord Of The Rings and Game Of Thrones to ET and The Godfather. Naturally, the couple had the lightbulb moment while cooking in the kitchen – while making dough for potato scones, which reminded them of that scene from Ghost with Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze.

They’ve become so popular that they’ve gotten requests from other people – and they just use what they spot at home: Canned tomatoes instead of blood or a vacuum cleaner instead of a gun.
