“Wearing a mask takes some getting used to, for sure,” said Dr Scott Segal, chairman of anaesthesiology at Wake Forest Baptist Health. “You are probably wearing it exactly right if it’s a little stuffy.” Here are the dos and don’ts of wearing a mask.

DON’T: Wear the mask below your nose.

DON’T: Leave your chin exposed.

DON’T: Wear your mask loosely with gaps on the sides.

DON’T: Push your mask under your chin to rest on your neck.

DO: Wear your mask so it comes all the way up, close to the bridge of your nose, and all the way down under your chin. Do your best to tighten the loops or ties so it’s snug around your face, without gaps.
