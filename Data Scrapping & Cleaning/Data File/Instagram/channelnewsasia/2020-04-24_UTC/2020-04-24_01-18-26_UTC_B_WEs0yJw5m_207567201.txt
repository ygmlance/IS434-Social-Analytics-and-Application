With Japanâ€™s Golden Week holiday season coming up, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike has urged residents to stay at home during the normally busy period and watch TV instead. Specifically, Marie Kondo.

Koike asked people, who would normally flood the streets during this time, to confine themselves for 12 days, starting tomorrow (Apr 25). "There will be people who think 'alright, lets tidy up,'" Koike said, adding that KonMari "will give tidying up pointers" via a video. Sounds like something everyone outside of Japan could also do, no? #Japan #Tokyo #GoldenWeek #MarieKondo #home #cleaningtips #KonMari #holiday (Photo: Netflix)
