The hit K-drama series Crash Landing On You introduced many viewers to the world of North Korea – but an Indonesian channel may have taken it a step too far after literally using an image of its famous lead actor in an actual story about the country.

CNN Indonesia recently apologised for putting up a picture of South Korean actor Hyun Bin during a report about Kim Jong Un’s health condition on Apr 21. The actor played the role of North Korean soldier Captain Ri Jeong-hyeok in the show.

A news anchor later said: “The news package was on the issues surrounding Kim Jong-un, who was reportedly in critical condition, which has no relation to the Captain Ri character in the Korean drama series. This error was not intentional, and we apologise for this mistake."
