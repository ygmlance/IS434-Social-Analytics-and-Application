Jason Chua, 28, and partner Hung Zhen Long, 27, are the guys behind “creative zhap cai png” stall, Beng Who Cooks. Ever since circuit breaker measures kicked in, business has dropped 80 per cent. But they’re still giving away free food to help those who can’t afford to eat.

Under their Beng Who Cares Foundation, those in need can simply claim a free meal, no questions asked. All the pair needs is the address to deliver to.

Are they worried about being taken advantage of? Said Jason: “If people really resort to such things, then deep down, they really need that help.” Link in bio for details. (Photo: @bengwhocooks ) #covidkindness #singapore
