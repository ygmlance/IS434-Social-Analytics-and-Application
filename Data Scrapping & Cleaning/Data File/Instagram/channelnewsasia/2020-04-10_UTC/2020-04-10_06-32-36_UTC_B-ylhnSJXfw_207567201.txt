Tigers and murder and meth – oh, my! Netflix has confirmed a new episode of Tiger King, the bizarre documentary series about exotic animal zookeepers in small-town America that has bewildered stay-at-home audiences since its Mar 20 debut.

The new episode, The Tiger King And I, is an after-show special hosted by Community’s Joel McHale, featuring new interviews with Joe Exotic’s ex-husband John Finlay, former staff John Reinke, Saff, Joshua Dial and Erik Cowie, reality show producer Rick Kirkman, and the zoo’s controversial new owner Jeff Lowe and wife Lauren. Exotic and arch-nemesis Carole Baskin will not be featured in the special.

Tiger King And I drops April 12 on Netflix. Link in bio to the full CNA Lifestyle story! #tigerking #joeexotic #carolebaskin #netflix #CNAlifestyle (Photo: @netflix )
