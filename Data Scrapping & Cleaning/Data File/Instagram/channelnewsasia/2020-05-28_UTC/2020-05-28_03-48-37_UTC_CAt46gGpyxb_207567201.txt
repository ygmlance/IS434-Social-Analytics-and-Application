It’ll be the one reunion to rule them all. The Lord Of The Rings cast are coming together for an episode of Frozen actor Josh Gad’s online show Reunited Apart on Jun 1 midnight, Singapore time.

The teaser trailer showed most of the Fellowship will be there, including Sam (Sean Astin), Frodo (Elijah Wood), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), Pippin (Billy Boyd), Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Gandalf (Ian McKellen) also comes in and quotes: “All we have to do is to decide what to do with the time that is given to us.” Monaghan also posted a screenshot of the video call on Instagram with even more people: Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), Gollum (Andy Serkis), Eomer (Karl Urban), Eowyn (Miranda Otto), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Arwen (Liv Tyler), as well as director Peter Jackson and writer Philippa Boyens.
