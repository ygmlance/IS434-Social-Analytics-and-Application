Several notes appeared to have been found in Hana Kimura’s Tokyo home after the 22-year-old wrestler and Terrace House star reportedly took her life on Saturday (May 23). According to Kyodo News, a piece of paper was attached to her door which read: “Toxic gas being generated.” Another note that said “Thank you for giving birth to me" was addressed to her mother.

That same day, she wrote on Twitter: “Every day, I receive nearly 100 honest opinions and I cannot deny that I get hurt.” Echoing her written note, she also said: “Thank you for giving birth to me, Mom. I wanted to be loved in life.” Her suicide has drawn condolences and condemnation of the bullies from her co-stars and other Japanese figures.
