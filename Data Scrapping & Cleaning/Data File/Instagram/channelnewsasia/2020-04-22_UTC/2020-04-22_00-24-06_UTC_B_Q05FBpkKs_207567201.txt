Singapore’s “circuit breaker” period has been extended to June 1. But if you were thinking of ordering online a nice, refreshing cup of bubble tea to comfort yourself, that might be hard.

The list of essential services that will stay open during this period have been trimmed even further. That means specialised food and beverage outlets will have to shut for now, including outlets that “predominantly” sell drinks like bubble tea, fruit juice, smoothies, coffee, soya bean and alcoholic drinks. Popcorn stores, bak kwa shops, ice cream shops, outlets that mainly sell cakes, cupcakes, cheese and other desserts will have to close too.

And if you’ve got zero shaving skills, you might have to resign yourself to growing your hair out this circuit breaker period), as hairdressers and barbers will have to close their outlets.
