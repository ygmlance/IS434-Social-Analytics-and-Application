GUI Circuit Breaker Challenge: "Gratitude". As we're halfway through this Circuit Breaker, be kind to yourself as everyone is going through this differently and find time to show gratitude not only for the little things in life, but to yourself. Journal/Draw/Muse on this word today and tag us!

Yours,

As a cancer survivor, the Circuit Breaker brought back memories of times spent alone in my isolation room or at home by myself during my recovery. It is quite sobering to relive those times because it reminded me of another trying time. However, I am grateful for this opportunity to look back and appreciate how far I have come since then. - Kiran
