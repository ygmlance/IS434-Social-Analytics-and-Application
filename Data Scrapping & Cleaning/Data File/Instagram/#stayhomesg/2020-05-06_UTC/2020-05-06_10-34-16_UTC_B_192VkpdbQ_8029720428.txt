6 May 2020 ~ I did my fave 30 min Tabata (complete), tried out 15 mins of Hip Hop Tabata & stop halfway because my hand eye leg coordination really CMI hahahaa, ppl look so cool, I flapping like bird. But hey I completed Chloe Ting Shred Challenge (a bit lacking but tried my best!!) 💪😎 I really went all out today!!
