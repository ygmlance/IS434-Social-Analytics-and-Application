Last night dinner. Finally broke the no chicken meals streak. 
Tried the Tung Lok fiesta ready made herbal chicken. 1pack is half chicken and barely enough for us 2A1C. My boy like the herbal taste though I thought it was a bit bitter. 
Stir fried a plate a French beans as a veggie side to have a more balanced meal
