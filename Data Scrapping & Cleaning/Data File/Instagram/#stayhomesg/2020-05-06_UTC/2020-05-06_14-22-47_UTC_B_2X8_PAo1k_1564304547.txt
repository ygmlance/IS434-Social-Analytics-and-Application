#FMTransformationMask Design 1 is done!!! 🤣🤣🤣 Just a little fun to lighten up the mood during this period 😌 There will be 2 more designs coming up!! These masks are also for sale: part of the proceeds will go to ARC Children’s Centre, a non-profit #charity that cares for children with cancer or life-threatening illnesses ✨ For every #TransformationMask sold, we will make a child-size mask for the children in ARC and any other child who is in need! 😍 If you would like to donate directly to ARC, do click on the link in our product description! 
Thank you for supporting @freemovementsg’s fun creative side 💋 Please share this to make someone laugh a little more and to support the little ones in this world! 🙌🏻 Thank you and keep safe everyone! 🧵
