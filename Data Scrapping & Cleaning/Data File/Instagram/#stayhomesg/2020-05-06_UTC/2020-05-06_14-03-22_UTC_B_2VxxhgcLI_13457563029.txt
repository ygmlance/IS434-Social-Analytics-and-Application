Numbers are a current feature in my little girl’s life and she’s seizing every opportunity to count. Here’s sharing all the fun math activities we did this week. 5 ideas for you!
.
🌿Reality check #1: She loves counting but is still confused by larger numbers. And by large, I mean any number above 10.
.
🌿Reality check #2: She did not complete these in 1 sitting. It was done over the span of 2 days, as and when she wanted. There’s this piece where we used a 💩 stamp to make flower petals - halfway through, all she wanted was to just play with the stamp.
.
🌿Reality check #3: She prefers if I do the activities with her - partly for guidance, partly for company. And that’s why, we only did these during my tiny pockets of free time. The only things that can keep her occupied while I worked are books, play (with 👶🏻 )
and process art.

Remember, you can replicate these with simple sketches. I like to add more colours because doodling is my kind of fun!
