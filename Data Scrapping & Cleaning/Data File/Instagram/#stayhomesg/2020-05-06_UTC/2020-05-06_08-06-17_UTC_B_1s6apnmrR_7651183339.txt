“The migrant workers really enjoyed the fruits. We want to say a huge thanks to the donors!” – Jestyn, YMCA Staff.

A group of local jewellers donated over 2,400 “Apples and Oranges from our Hearts” to Wok the Talk, that were delivered to migrant workers in need last weekend. They intend to donate more in the coming weeks.

We are so moved by the support by donors and the public so far. Please read more and find out how you can help vulnerable communities affected by COVID-19 through the link in the bio!
