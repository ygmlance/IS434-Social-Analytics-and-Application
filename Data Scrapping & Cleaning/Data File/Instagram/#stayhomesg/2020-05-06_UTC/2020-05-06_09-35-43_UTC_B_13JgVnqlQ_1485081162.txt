Boring of traditional bread and jam. Today we try some new way to prepare bread for breakfast 
1.) Egg n bacon on the bread. Press the middle part bread to place the egg. Put the two bacon at the side. Sprinkle some salt and Italian herb.
2.) Quick and easy mini pizza with bread as pizza crust. (my son loves it so much). Spread some butter on the bread,put some Parmesan & mozzarella cheese, tomato, capsicum, pineapple, ham, bacon, hotdog.......
3.) Mini cupcake bread. Cut the bread into round shape, stuck it into a cupcake mold. In another bowl, whisk an egg and some milk, put some tomato, broccoli, ham, bacon ...and top with mozzarella cheese. 
Bake in 180 degree for 12-15 minutes. The outer of bread is crunchy and inner is soft. Yummy ðŸ˜‹
