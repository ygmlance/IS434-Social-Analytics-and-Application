It is a day to commemorate body acceptance as well as a reminder to focus on moderation eating rather than fad diets which may pose adverse effects on ones body . 🙅‍♀️

As one said, "Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, and even more so if consumed in good company. Indulge in your favorite food with a friend — mindfully. Enjoy the taste and the fellowship." Quoted from http://ow.ly/Q8FU50zsC7m
