Haven’t had hor fun in awhile.. so here it is . Starchy and eggy with whatever ingredients I could find in my bursting fridge 😅🤣.
.
shimeji mushrooms and salmon isn’t the usual items to be found in hor fun but it there is no rule to say I can’t add them in 😃 A handful of green dragon veg 🤣 青龙菜 was on the countertop so I just threw it into the wok as well.
.

I learn how to prepare hor fun by observing how it was done by my mum in the past. This is definitely not zi char standard but it’s good enough for me and my other half 😉
