Made claypot rice without claypot. The ingredients used were 2 chicken legs, mushrooms, Chinese sausage & liver sausage, pan-fried salted fish, vegetables and lots of freshly fried shallots. I have to cook again tomorrow because the other 2 members at home complained that I cooked too little, and they want more! 😆
用鑄鐵鍋煮瓦煲雞飯，配料是兩隻雞腿，臘腸和潤腸，煎香的鹹魚粒，香菇，青菜還有現炸油蔥酥。老公和女兒說我煮得太少了，明天還要再煮一次~😅 #circuitbreaker #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomesg  #homecooking #sghomecooking #homecookingisthebest #sgfoodporn #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodie #sgfooddiary #foodphotography #food52 #foodblogger #8dayseat #straitstimesfood
