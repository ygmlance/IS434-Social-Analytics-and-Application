Very unfortunate today, we waited for 3hrs with the girl online cant tell us where the delivery guy is. From 1130am with follow ups every now and then, we received the order at ard 230pm and guess what everything is not RIGHT! None of the selection from Loving Set is delivered to us.. No seabass, no salad, no pasta, and others.. what we received was merely the daily veggies, pumpkin and brocs, brown rice, grilled chix which we normally cooked at home..",
