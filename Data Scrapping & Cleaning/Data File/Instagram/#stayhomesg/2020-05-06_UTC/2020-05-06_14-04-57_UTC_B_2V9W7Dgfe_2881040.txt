Made peanut ang ku kueh & roasted duck noodles (store-bought roast duck). So so yummy & cravings satisfied! Was quite fortunate to be able to get all the ingredients from the supermarket yesterday (last packet of peanut powder!) My very humorous hubby commented to say the noodles are CRYSTAL JEAN noodles!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Really running out of cooking ideas...anyone can suggest? hee hee
