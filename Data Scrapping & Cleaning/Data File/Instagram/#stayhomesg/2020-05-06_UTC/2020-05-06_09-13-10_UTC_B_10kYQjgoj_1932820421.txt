6kg too soft & made the mistake of opening the base way too big for the form intended. I ended up making more mistakes by pushing and pulling too much, I told the clay “please, I’m sorry” 😕 but it got tired & I got tired and we came to a compromise and now I have this ‘Tomeh’ piece. I’ll let it dry, carve it and see if I’ll keep it.  Hahaha,  so that’s another day of staying home for me, I am waiting for my regular clay body, maybe then I’ll be able to throw at ease. 🥳😌🤷🏻‍♀️ .
