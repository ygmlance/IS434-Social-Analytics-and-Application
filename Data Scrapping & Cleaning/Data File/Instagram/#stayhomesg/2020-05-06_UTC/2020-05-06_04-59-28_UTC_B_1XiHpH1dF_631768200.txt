Day 30 Circuit breaker- Part 2 of my heart theme lunch.
I decided to do another version for the Hay bee hiam lovers too if you think Furikake is not your cup of tea.
Alright the first picture is for kids.
See the rest of the pictures.
And the best part is, i spotted a natural heart shape on the Gardenia bread itself on the very last picture. Cool ! ❤🧡💛😁 #jasmine_homemade
