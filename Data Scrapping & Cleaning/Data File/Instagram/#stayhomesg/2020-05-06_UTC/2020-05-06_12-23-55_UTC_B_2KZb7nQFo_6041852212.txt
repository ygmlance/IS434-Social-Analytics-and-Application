Finally back to some soup and dishes meal.

Fried eggs with bittergourd
Air fried cod fish
Pork ribs carrot apple soup

This is one of my favourite soup during this CB period as both apples and carrots are easily available and can be kept in the fridge for weeks. Add in some honey dates and pork ribs, you have a light and slightly sweet soup for the kids.
