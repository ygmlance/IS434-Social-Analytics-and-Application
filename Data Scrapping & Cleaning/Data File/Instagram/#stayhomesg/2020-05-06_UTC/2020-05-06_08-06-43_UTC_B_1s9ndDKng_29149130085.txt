Last time, illegal hawkers ran away from police (mata). Now maskless offenders run as well.
.
Tidbit: Singapore in the 1960s and 1970s - mata wore shorts (better for chasing) and when someone shouts Mata, illegal hawkers scrambled to flee with their food carts like bulls. Hence the term “zao di gu” which roughly translates to “running bulls”
