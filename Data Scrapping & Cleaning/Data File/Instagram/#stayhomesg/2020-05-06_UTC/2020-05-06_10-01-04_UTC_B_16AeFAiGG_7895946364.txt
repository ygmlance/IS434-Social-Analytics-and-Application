Struggling with working from home? Here are four #WFH tips:⁠
⁠
☀️Protect Skin with Sunscreen ⁠
Yes, you need sunscreen even when you’re indoors. If you’re sitting by a window, you’re susceptible to harmful rays that cause dark spots + wrinkles. Ours will protect you from both UVA & UVB rays!⁠
⁠
💯 Focus Better with Candles ⁠
Did you know scents can influence brain activity and improve one’s mood? Lift your spirits with our Satsuma Candle’s energising scent! It’s eco-friendly and made without additives and dyes.⁠
⁠
☕ Stay Awake with Coffee ⁠
Standalone coffee shops are closed till the end of Circuit Breaker (01 June 2020). So make your own coffee for now, it’s really easy. We have unique flavours ranging from S’mores to Speculoos!⁠
⁠
💁 Look Awake with Concealer⁠
Conceal those dark eye circles for your work video calls, so your colleagues won’t find out that you haven’t slept at all.
