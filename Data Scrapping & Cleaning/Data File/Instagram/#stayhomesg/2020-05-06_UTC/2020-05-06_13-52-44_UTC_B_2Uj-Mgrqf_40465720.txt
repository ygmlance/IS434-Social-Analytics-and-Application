ðŸŽ¼We are learning the ukulele from @yousician (not a sponsored post ðŸ¤£).
.

I actually bought this ukulele years ago but gave up trying to learn because pressing on the strings hurt my fingers...and I donâ€™t want to have calluses, yes Iâ€™m so weak!! Any tips? Can I wear gloves or something? ðŸ§¤ðŸ˜¬?
.
But look! My son is learning and heâ€™s doing better than me. Super proud!.
