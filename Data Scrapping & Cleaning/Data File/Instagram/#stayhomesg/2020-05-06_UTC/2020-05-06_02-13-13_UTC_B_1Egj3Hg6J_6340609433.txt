#CircuitBreaker Day30⠀
⠀
Good morning, everyone! Today’s simple breakfast, spreading generous portion of peanut butter evenly on our Gardenia Super soft wholemeal white bread 🍞! Our new love for peanut butter spread, Mayver’s! ⠀
⠀
✖️ No added oil or sugar⠀
✔️ Super fragrant, very smooth textured⠀
✔️ Made in Australia 🇦🇺 ⠀

No turning back to other brands once you start on this. So far, this is the most fragrant peanut butter we have ever came across and there’s so much variation of choices to choose from, Dark Roasted, All Natural Smooth, Crunchy, Protein and Organic. You may get your hands on them at FairPrice! Goes so well with any bread or plain cookies! ⠀
