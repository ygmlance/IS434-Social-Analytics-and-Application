Posting my last shot of sunset colours in Phuket and with that, I left my #wanderlust and started on my mummy adventures. During my pregnancy, I didn't post because I didn't want to use my mobile phone too much. Although I lost hundreds of followers and my likes plummet from 200 to 20, I have no regrets. üòç

To my 1000 odd followers, I know this post might not even reach you due to the new algorithm, My Pineapple Days still wants to thank you for following through the foodie moments, cooking adventures and travel stories. I was really lost when I started my travels, some on my own. I really needed the break. It was such a special experience. I will be posting some of those special moments with you. I am glad I found myself again, having a new start and a refreshed soul from my travels.

But who will ever guess that now travel has become a word that is associated with tensions, racism and even circuit breakers. I do not know what will become of us, but right now, all we can do is to cherish our family (since we are at home with them all the time), be in the moment and it's actually a good time to reconnect with all those old friends, cousins and relatives esp those whom we see only once a year, to drop a Stay Home Stay Safe message and don't forget to kiss your spouse and tell him you love him... üòç

And to all of you, Stay Home Stay Safe Stay Loved. üòò
