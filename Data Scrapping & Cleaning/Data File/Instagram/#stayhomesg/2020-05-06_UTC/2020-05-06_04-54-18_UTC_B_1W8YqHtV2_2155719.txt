Happy Hump Day again! 
I have some leftover stew duck bones. The best thing to do with it is to turn it into porridge dish. 
For lunch, I have cooked Claypot Duck Porridge with water chestnut and sweet corn. 
Simmered the bones for the base broth and add in the cooked rice, water chestnut, sweet corn. And I finished it off with a drizzle of sesame oil and tiny weeny bit of light soya sauce.  Yum, the porridge is velvety and full of flavour. ðŸ¤¤
