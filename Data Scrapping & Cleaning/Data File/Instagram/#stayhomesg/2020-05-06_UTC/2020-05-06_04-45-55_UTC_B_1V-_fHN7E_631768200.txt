Part 1.

Day 30 of Circuit breaker.
Yesterday was 5-5-2020. Japan children's day.
And May is also the start of School holiday here in SG.
I decided to make this fun lunch with Healthy Gardenia Low GI Soft grain loaf.
I am using very simple ingredients here.
Bread, egg, Japanese furikake & Japanese vegetables heart shaped crackers ( you can use any colourful cereal or cornflakes too). #jasmine_homemade
