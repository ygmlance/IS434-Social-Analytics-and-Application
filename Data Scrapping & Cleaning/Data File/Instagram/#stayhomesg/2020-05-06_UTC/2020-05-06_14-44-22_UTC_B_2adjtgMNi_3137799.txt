Bringing this sing-along back again! (since so many tuned in previously. hahahaha)

This round, we want to be better prepared! hahaha Other than the list of songs that we have collated based on other mummies' input, you can tell us what you would like to sing with us in the comments, or if you want us to do a shout out for your mama!

Ask your mum and dad and let's hang out on Facebook and sing LIVE! :) P/S: Grandma Pearl and Grandma Jenny are super excited, together with Grandpa George and Grandpa Kuang!

See you this Sunday, 8pm, Facebook LIVE!

Some songs suggested so far: 当你孤单你会想起谁、多美丽的玫瑰花、童年、朋友、春去春回来、爱如潮水、至少还有你、情人的眼泪、夜来香、月亮代表我的心
