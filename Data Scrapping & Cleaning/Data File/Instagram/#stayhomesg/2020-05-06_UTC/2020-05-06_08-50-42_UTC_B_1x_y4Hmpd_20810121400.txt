My fav bao shop!!! 😚

Yam bun & red bean bun was 💯 for me, love that they put alot of filling inside?!!? But the fact that I love yam more than redbean, yam bun wins hands down hehe 🙌🏽 Durian bun was really good too tbh, could taste that real durian meat was put inside the bun. But I guess I only prefer durian as a dessert on the cold side or as a fruit itself. Can't appreciate as much when its steamed hot HAHA but nonetheless I think its the best durian bun out there 
Only wished just dough was walking distance away from my house, I would eat then buns for breakfast every morning 😌
