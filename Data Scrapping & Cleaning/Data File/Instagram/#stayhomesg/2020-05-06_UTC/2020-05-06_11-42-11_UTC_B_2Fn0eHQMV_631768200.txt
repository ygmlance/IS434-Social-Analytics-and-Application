Day 30 of Circuit breaker.
It took me 30 days to create something that i really love. I love how i present it.
My heart shaped theme dinner.
The best stay home CB dinner.😁
I made a mistake. I should have mixed the furikake before shaping it. I can only topped it and mix later. Brown rice mixed with barley again.
The mould didn't end up useless,  it works. 
Perfect heart shape Sunny side up.😊
Stirred fried pork, char siew,  Lup Cheong , tomatoes & some winter melon strips chopped to sweeten. I craved Nonya Dumplings. 😁
And my homemade barley. I need a heart shaped cup! 😁
On this day 30 of CB  I thank Health heroes with a Nurse fuchiko and she is holding a heart.❤ #jasmine_homecooked #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithst
