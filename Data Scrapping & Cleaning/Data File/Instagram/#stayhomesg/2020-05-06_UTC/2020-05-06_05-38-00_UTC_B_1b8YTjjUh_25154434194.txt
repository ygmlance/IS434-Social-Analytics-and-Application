Lunch this midweek is a simple affair of a deep fried Kembong (Indian mackeral) each, Cabbage Hae Bee (Dried Shrimp) and a piping hot bowl of sweet potato porridge. My late Cantonese porpor’s (maternal gran) chilli dipping sauce is the star of the show here where the delicate but harmonious balance of hot, salty, sour and sweet is measured by Momsy’s gifted sense of agak-ration (a concept of more or less, tasting as you go along).

I’m totally won over by the judicious use of pickled shallots and juicy indian limes to ring in the tang factor here. We have the added bonus of stormy weather today that makes this meal all the more comforting for the soul and the belly. .
