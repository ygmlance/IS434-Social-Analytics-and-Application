Although I caught the @iamjaynedoe’s IG “Live” cooking class hosted by none other than @heyrozz (“LET’S COOK” is a twice-a-week thing Roz does on Tuesdays and Fridays with different guest chefs), is anyone at all surprised I haven’t got around to cooking the “Prawn Tang Hoon”? 😂
Hence, when Jayne told me she was going to cook me a family serving of it, I was bloody pleased. Can so tell from watching their video, it’s a shoo-in for a flavourbomb.
How right I am. As easy as Jayne makes the preparation look (check out her Instagram Highlights - she’s pinned her recipe there), the dish punches way above its weight in terms of aroma (seriously, the fragrance just about knocked me off my feet when I opened the package) and tastiness. And here’s proof that it doesn’t matter what prawns are used either since they all have a very similar intrinsic sweetness. So although she used the paler ocean species today (the best she could find from her visit to the wet market this morning), my whole family and I hereby proclaim it tastes all kinds of amazing.
What’s more, I also received a jar of her homemade Mala Oil too! 🥰 It’s something I have been salivating over whenever I see her make it on her IG Stories. Tried out her tip to dip the prawns in a mix of that and light soya sauce, and yup, it’s out-of-this-world 🤤🤤🤤. Thanks again babe, for such a thoughtful and extremely satisfying care package.
