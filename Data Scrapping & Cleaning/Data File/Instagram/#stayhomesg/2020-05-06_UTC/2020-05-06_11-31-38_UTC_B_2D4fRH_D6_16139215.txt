made my first lor mai gai and lettered my first igtv this week. that was so much fun?! :D never had such deep feelings for lor mai gai previously, but now that i have tasted this upscale lor mai gai, i am a glutinous rice convert. thank you so much for joining us for the live cook-along on sunday, my friends. the full recipe is up on @sgpnoodles’ website if you’d like to try this for yourself (you should!!)
