Very easy to make. Great activity for the kiddos at home without make a mess in the kitchen. No added sugar to sweeten them, naturally sweetened by the bananas and dried Organic Mulberries, both are my lil boy’s favourites. Flourless, perfect for anyone who wants a healthy, wheat-free snack.
(Dark brown colour is due to dried mulberries).
