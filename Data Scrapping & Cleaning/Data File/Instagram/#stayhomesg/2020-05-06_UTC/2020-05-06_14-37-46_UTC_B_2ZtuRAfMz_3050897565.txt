Underrated simple pleasures of CB.
1. Flask of #kopi from downstairs kopitiam and cheese super ring (which I haven't eaten in eons) because my mama shop ran out of Ruffles and Lays, and because I didn't have my must-have coffee fix earlier today. having this at 10 pm watching my Korean drama curled up in my room with aircon turned on
2. @milosingapore peng from downstairs kopitiam because no more bubble tea.
3. #latte from @7eleven. Still one of the best #coffee deals in town for below $2!
4. bee hoon with runny egg on top. Can buy breakfast from kopitiam downstairs though this one home made.
5. and 6. Drinking my sister's homemade #kombucha. She had bought it in the attas original Australian bottle and lovingly nurtured the #scoby remnants within over two weeks until it grew big. Now she just has to feed it with tea and sugar, saving $13 a pop for as long as she wants as long as the scoby stays alive 
7. Nestea. With brown sugar. heartland @7elevensg has exclusive drinks too and this was not bad! #nestea #milktea
8 Humble siew tor 寿桃 or longevity bun as afternoon snack. 
9 #curry #bread from neighbourhood bakery as midnight snack. I don't have sweet tooth so curry best bet.
10 delightful light neighbourhood bakery #cheesecake No sweet tooth so salty cheesecake is my fave. Temporarily gone now but cakes allowed back on 12 May! Looking forward!
