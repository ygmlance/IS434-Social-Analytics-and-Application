Shortly before the start of the Circuit Breaker, @eatmefabulous and I had a catch-up meal at @vuesingapore. Coincidentally, it was also when this restaurant launched their Set Lunch Menu. It turned out to be very good with the Alaskan King Crab Sandwich and the New Zealand King Ōra Salmon leaving the deepest impression.
So when VUE had one of their NEW Chef’s Set Menu Bundles delivered to me, I was a happy camper. FYI - there are a few options in this collection starting from a 1-Pax Set for $39. The 4-course meal I received was the $98 for 2 Pax and it‘s particularly good value based from the quality of ingredients, portion size and taste.
As welcome a surprise as the five large Norwegian blue mussels were, I would have enjoyed the leek and potato soup on its own too. Flavourful from the vegetables and shaved bottarga, it had a thick and fluffy consistency.
Besides the soup, the Set Menu also came with mini #sliders as an appetiser. There is a vegetarian option but I chose the “Buffalo Hot Sauce Chicken” and the “BBQ Smoked Pork” - they did not disappoint.
Naturally, I had to have the King Ōra Salmon for my main course once I spotted it on the menu. And it’s every bit as fabulous as I recall. Ditto the luscious morel mushroom and clam beurre blanc sauce. Effortlessly holding it own was the accompanying buttered asparagus and silky-smooth mash. I highly recommend this if you love #salmon but even if you don’t, I actually think this “Wagyu of Salmon” from the pristine waters of New Zealand might be able to change your mind. 
The other main I chose was the Yellow French Chicken. Served with still-crunchy Romanesco Brocolli, purple and white cauliflower, and a surprisingly delicious tomato-flavoured rice, it was also flawlessly cooked. I found the pickled ginger sauce really tasty too.
The two desserts of #BurntCheesecake with Mixed Berries and Acacia #HoneyCake were spot-on. If you‘re lusting for something rich and creamy, go for the former but the latter appealed more to me with its uniqueness. Moreover, it reminded me of the #RussianHoneyCake which I‘m a fan of.
