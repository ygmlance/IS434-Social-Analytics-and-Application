Please note that we will only be able to collect the 500ml bottles with green caps in the meantime. Kindly ensure that the bottles are thoroughly cleaned prior to returning them to us. We will unfortunately have to refuse them otherwise! This is an effort to ensure our kitchen is kept free of contaminants when the bottles are returned for further processing.

We will gradually be rolling out a 100% recycling program in the coming weeks. We know you’ve been waiting so we can’t wait to tell you when we do! :):)
