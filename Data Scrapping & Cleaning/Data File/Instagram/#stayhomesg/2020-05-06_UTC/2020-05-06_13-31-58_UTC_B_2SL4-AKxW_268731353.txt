The truth is crafting with toddlers is 3 times more challenging. ⠀
.⠀
Most times you barely get down to the actual crafting and you’ve lost your audience/ materials. Most times you’re actually doing most of the craft. Sometimes you’ll have to deal with a meltdown or fight or fish out materials from the 1yo’s mouth. If you’re lucky enough to retain your toddler clients, you usually have to adapt the craft as you go. The only consistent guarantee is a mess.⠀
.⠀
But craft on anyway. Craft on for the learnings beyond the art piece. Craft on to witness the kids’ imaginations come alive. Craft on for the sake of shared time together. And craft on for the love of crafting. ⠀

Crafting with toddlers is challenging, but possible and hopefully made easy with some tips from yours truly. #stayhomesg #CircuitBreaker
