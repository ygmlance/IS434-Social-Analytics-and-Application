Breaking Circuit D30...
Apple mint. The wooly one. Densely hairy. Reminds me of...🧘🏽‍♀️. Minthe, the water nymph was transformed by Persephone into a plant. Revenge for her ongoing affair with Hades. The apple one is brighly colored with a fruity fragrance. Breaking down fat and accelerating metabolism level. Helping with cold & flu. Dr. Sniffle? Now Minthe has benefits & perks. Perfect timing! Sow it!
