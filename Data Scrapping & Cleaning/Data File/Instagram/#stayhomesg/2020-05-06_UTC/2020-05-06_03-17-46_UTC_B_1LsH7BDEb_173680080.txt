@tonkotsukazan Tonkotsu Kazan originates from Osaka, Japan, they are known for their tonkotsu (pork bone) broth and original noodles, served with a dash of personal style, in a kazan (volcanic) fashion for the burst of flavours on your taste buds. Established since 1966,they operate over 30 popular restaurants in Japan, including Kangeki Tanuki, Bikkuri Donkey, Takagi Udon, Youmenya Pietro and Marugen Ramen. Tonkotsu Kazan is renowned for their signature Volcano Ramen which we tried two of the flavours: Karamiso (spicy miso), Shoyu. The delivery also comes with additional hard-boiled eggs. 
Spicy miso Kazan Karamiso: The home made ramen noodles are made thicker than usual so it doesnâ€™t get soggy so fast. The noodle texture is bouncy and has a semi-firm bite to it, giving quite a pleasant taste sensation. The original tonkotsu stock broth is also flavourful and you can see the soup takes hours of boiling to extract the deep pork bone flavours.
Chicken Kaarage:Its slightly crunchy and golden-brown skin encased tender meat. 
Gyoza-obsessed friend wanted to try the fried gyozas here,surprisingly good. The exterior was crisp and the insides moist and yummy.
Bento : Special price bento at $8 and $9 we tried the Beef BBQ Bento which is delicious and portion is value for money.
