Some excitement today, while I was WFH.
A visit from a bat after lunch. It was outside our window for a while. Then it flew into our home and couldn't find its way out. Cue the screaming and ducking from me.
My brother managed to catch & trap it when he got home a few hours later. He released it later on at night.
I'm still freaking out a little. A large moth last month, a bat this month. What's next?
