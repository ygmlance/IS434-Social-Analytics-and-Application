Spotlight for this week: Burgs by @projectwarung! 🍔

Really great burgers with really friendly service staff, but we kinda regret choosing the single instead of double patty burgers cos the patties were really juicy so one patty is definitely not enough. 😂

They do provide islandwide delivery but you can also opt for free self pickup from their outlets at Chai Chee and Bukit Batok, so take some time off from the kitchen today and order up! 🛵

Simply check out their extensive menu at @projectwarung and whatsapp them at 94578622 (Bukit Batok) or 90230584 (Chai Chee) to place your orders. Their friendly staff will assist you accordingly. ✨
