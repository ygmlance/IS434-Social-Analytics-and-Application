Tadah! My mini Tau Sar Ham Chim Peng is done! 豆沙咸煎饼 （red bean paste Chinese fried fritters)
Piping hot from the fryer. 
So happy it’s a success though lots of slogging n kneading. 💪😁
The filling have used the Japanese red bean paste as it is less sweet n finer paste. 
I’m going to brew a cup of green tea to go with it.
