Weeks has past since the start of #circuitbreakersg and we've learnt the new way of living.

This is a test of our adaptability and mummy is so proud of you. You've stop sticking your legs out of the metal door & demanding to go down to the playground everyday. We've found new ways to entertain ourselves at home. Our before bedtime routine became skyping with @lukecheong88, passing balls & singing jinglebells at the same time (I don't know why you must listen to jinglebells every night), or reading books.

Life will probably never be the same again, but I hope our happiness in life remains the same.
