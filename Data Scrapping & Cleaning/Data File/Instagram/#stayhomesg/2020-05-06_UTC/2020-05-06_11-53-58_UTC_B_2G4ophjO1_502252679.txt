Alhamdulillah....
Todayâ€™s iftar menu Korean food again and itâ€™s homemade ðŸ¥°
.
.
Kimbab with filling cheese, spinach, hotdog and omelette... Comes with Korean Army Stew but not much vegetables inside coz itâ€™s just us small eater eating. .
.
Made so little and still we canâ€™t finish even half the portion we made. Gave some of it to my neighbour and we ended up with more food ðŸ˜… coz they give back and another neighbour passed by to oass food also. .
.
Though rushing but itâ€™s all a success but my daughter said the Army Stew can be spiciera bit. Plus I still have some Kimchi left in my fridge. .
.
Looking forward to make my own Gochujang but needs sunny time to let it ferment for 2-3 months. See if I rajin ah coz I really run out of it already now. .
