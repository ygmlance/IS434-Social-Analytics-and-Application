#TransformationMask Design 1 is done!!! 🤣🤣🤣 Had so much fun sewing this mask!!!!! Hahhaha! Just a little fun to lighten up the mood during this period 😌 There will be 2 more designs coming up!! These masks are also for sale: part of the proceeds will go to Arc Children's Centre, a non-profit #charity that cares for children with cancer or life-threatening illnesses ✨ For every #TransformationMask sold, we will make a child-sized mask for the children in ARC and any other child who is in need! 😍 If you would like to donate directly to ARC, do head to arcchildren.org and click on “donate” @giving.sg ❤️ Thank you for supporting my crazy ideas and @freemovementsg fun creative side 💋 Please share this to make someone laugh a little more and to support the little ones in this world! 🙌🏻 Thank you and keep safe everyone! 🧵
