🌻In March, when Manila went into lockdown, mori moms assembled face shields for frontliners in Philippines. This opportunity gave more mori moms jobs during this lockdown period, an answered prayer. Now, we are accepting preorders for denim/canvas/cotton reusable face mask for mori moms to make, using leftover fabrics in our warehouse. For every purchase, 1 other mask will be donated through @contribute_sg to migrant workers or elderly. #DoubleGiveBack
