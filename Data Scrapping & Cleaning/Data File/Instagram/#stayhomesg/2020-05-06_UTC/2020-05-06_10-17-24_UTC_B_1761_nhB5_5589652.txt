Major shoe cabinet👟 👠 overhaul.
I must say this #circuitbreaker has been pretty productive in clearing up the house a tad more and putting things right in place. Cleaner, Neater.

Been putting this spring cleaning on hold since Mum’s surgery, no more procrastinating now. Time to geddup, get my ass movin’! 👊🏻💥🦠 Managed to reorganize, deodorize & sanitize my shoes closet with @ruhenssg WCE-200 Water Electrolyser. A 3 min effective, easy-to-use & convenient “Create Your Own” sterilizing fluid that deodorizes, sanitizes any & everything at home 🏡 💕

This Electrolyser uses electrolysis process to produce Hypochlorous Acid, highly effective in sanitizing and cleaning while being eco-friendly and safe for everyone to use! The electrolyzed water removes 99% germs and bacteria on furniture, appliances, clothes, shoes and can even be used to sanitize hands, remove odour from refrigerator & shoe cabinets and remove pesticides from fruits and vegetables. With zero percent alcohol, I’m extremely glad that it’s 💯 safe for Chriselle! This super cool sterilizing gadget is fast becoming my mini helper’s best cleaning aid in our house. #notcomplaining 😉🙃🤩
