Riding on my boy's interest of being a fire fighter.  Saw this idea from one of the ig accounts (can't recall whose). Wrote multiple cards in the Chinese characters 火(fire) and 水 (water) and hid them around the house for my boy to hunt.

Told him that he must find all cards for the fire to be put out. 
The game kept him occupied for near 1 hour as we played 3 rounds of it in total. 
Apart from getting him to remember the Chinese characters,  I think it helps to train him to observe his surroundings better as he search/hide  the cards.
