This weekend has been AWESOME as I was able to catch-up with my Entrepreneur friends over Instagram LIVE interviews i to share valuable insights on the topic on: <Covid-19 Impact : What's up with Millennial- Entrepreneurs> ⬇️
The purpose is to learn, share positivity and gain insights from Entrepreneurs from different industries during Covid-19 situation.
⬇️
Most online videos and social media postings share about expressing appreciation for frontliners, which I feel that we should ALSO give support to our Entrepreneur friends who create jobs and values for society ! 🙌🏻 At the same time, I am looking into adding + values on my social media platforms, to engage with connections more, besides posting selfies ,yoga postures as a yoga coach and website articles.
⬇️
Special thanks to my Six Entrepreneur friends & connections who join me to share their experiences:

@rodric_chan
@mffa_q
@melmovement
@soqqle
@jacqzxc
@jazzieang

In my next few posts, I will be sharing about what I learn from the interviews.

Additionally I will be inviting another 6-7 Entrepreneurs onboard this upcoming weekend.

Stay tuned, drop a 👍🏻 and share with your friends / connections ❣️ Many Thanks ! ⬇️⬇️⬇️
