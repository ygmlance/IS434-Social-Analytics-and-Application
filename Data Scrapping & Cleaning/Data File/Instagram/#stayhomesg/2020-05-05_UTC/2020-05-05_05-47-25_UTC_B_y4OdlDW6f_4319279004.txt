PANCIT BIHON - Filipino style noodles stir fried with pork belly, chicken and veg for lunch. 
My Filipino helper gave me the 👍 and said the taste is the same as those she gets in the Philippines. 😄
.
Understand in Philippines, they also like to add prawns & chicken liver. 
This dish is served during birthdays as it symbolize long life and of course you can serve this anytime of the year too. .
