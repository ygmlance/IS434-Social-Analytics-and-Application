Last night’s dinner was an eclectic mix of flavours from the East and West as the delivered meal comprised of items from the different F&B outlets at @capitolkempinski. Allow me to take you on a tour of what we had:

1. Beautifully smoky, large Grilled Wild King #Prawns from @15stamford by @chefalvinleung.
2. A punchy appetite-whetter of a #GreenMangoSalad from @chalermthaisg.
3. Platter of mixed #Sausages for 2 pax with potato pancakes, sauerkraut and mash from @frieda.restaurant.
4. @lascalaristorantesg’s “Calabrese #Pizza” which had tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, Italian salami, black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, chilli flakes and oregano topped on a light and chewy crust. A few might find this on the salty side but I enjoyed it very much.
5. Very tasty Baked Potato Skins filled with chilli beef, sour cream and colby cheese.
6. Two lovely #desserts from @berthold.delikatessen: a pair of Portuguese Egg Tarts and a mini American-style #CarrotCake with lemon cream cheese frosting. 
If your household is divided in their preference for Asian and Western cuisines, the variety in @capitolkempinski’s Takeaway Menu offers a sound solution. What’s more, there’s a 15% off promotion going on right now. Just tap on the link in their bio to order, and use “𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐌𝐎𝟏𝟓” upon check-out.
