This #circuitbreakersg made easier with HowsBox!

As a mum, I was tempted to print off worksheets or order those assessment books, tracing, drawing lines to match..But i reminded myself: Children learn through hands-on activities! HowsBox activities are hands-on and fun, children are learning as they play, no tears from my LO and no screaming or stress from me. Here we are matching, sorting and learning names of the names of transportation vehicles!

Order now and we will post out once we are allowed to!
