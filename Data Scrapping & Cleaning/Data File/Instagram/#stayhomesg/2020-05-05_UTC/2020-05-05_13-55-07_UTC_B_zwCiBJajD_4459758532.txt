Got my brunch delivered because I can't make my toast as great as the traditional kaya toast paired with a delish cup of kopi c!ðŸ¤¤ On the table features curry chicken with rice set [$8.80], mee rebus set [$7.92] and an extra cup of homemade barley with lemon [$2.80] as we absolutely love their barley drink! Quite a steal as the dishes are currently having offers.

Consistent quality of food even on delivery though my kaya toasts weren't exactly crispy and turned soggy on the inside. Still, yummy la!ðŸ˜‹
