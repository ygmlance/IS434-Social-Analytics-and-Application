🔭May you travel to wonderful places, See wonderful things, Meet wonderful people, May you discover things you’d never dreamed of.🔭 I think this CB allows us to be more mindful of our surroundings and discover more hidden talents of our friends and family members! 🤣 Today, I discovered a new all-sheltered route to Chong Pang City from my building and I discovered there are actually many beautiful butterflies in my neighborhood.😍 Breakfast/brunch is yummy peanut waffle from an old school bakery in Chong Pang. Cheap and very nice. Also, pairing with 2 Hong Kong styled pastries (1 char siew, 1 red bean/pandan) from the hawker center. 😋😋😋 Bliss. Feeling excited today because the brush lettering online class that I signed up for is starting soon and I’m intending to try a new cake recipe again! Looks like today will be very busy and fulfilling🤩🤩🤩
