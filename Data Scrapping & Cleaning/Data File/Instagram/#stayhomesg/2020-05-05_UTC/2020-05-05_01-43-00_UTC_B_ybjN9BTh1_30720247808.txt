MATCHA PINWHEEL COOKIES - in association with Nadia’s Healthy Kitchen
RECIPE
1/2 cup (42g) ground almonds
1/2 cup (75g) gluten-free flour
1/4 cup (30g) cornflour
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp PureChimp matcha green tea powder 🍵
4 tbsp maple syrup
3-4 tbsp coconut oil, melted
DIRECTIONS
In a bowl, mix together the ground almonds, flour, cornflour, baking powder and salt.

Mix in the maple syrup and 3 tbsp melted coconut oil. The dough should hold together when you press it into a ball. If it doesn't hold, add more coconut oil - 1/2 tbsp at a time until it comes together. You shouldn't need more than 4 tbsp.

Divide dough into 2 equal halves. Mix the matcha powder into one half.

Wrap each half of the dough in cling film and place in the freezer for 30 minutes to make it easier to work with.

Preheat your oven to 180*C (160*C fan assisted)/ 350*F

Roll out the plain dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper. Repeat with the matcha dough.

Place the matcha dough on top of the plain dough. Start rolling into a tight cylinder.

Slice and place onto a baking sheet covered with parchment paper.

Bake for 15 minutes or until edges are golden brown.

Enjoy!💚💚💚💚💚💚💚 #purechimpasia #matcha #matchalover #stayhomesg #sgeats #sgfoodies
