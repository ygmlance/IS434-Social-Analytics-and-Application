Breaking Circuit D29...MAKAN...
Freedom...The day of concerts & festivals. Fokke&Sukke said it: 'The day that A-list celebrities came in helicopters to free everyone' ðŸ˜‰. Also the day of eating festive snacks. Mom made piping-hot bara's with home-made tongue-burning chutneys. Crispy out, fluffy in. Yummm. Extraspecial with the suprathin sliced spinach. Ecdysterone...For my Popeye biceps!
