#CircuitBreakerDay29 Because this morning FB reminded me of the Thai kway chap in bkk, so I decided to dabao this for dinner. The variety of ingredients /spare parts can't compare with the one in bkk, but the soup is super peppery and authentic ðŸ˜‹ Today's fried intestines disappointing though, not crispy ðŸ˜¤
