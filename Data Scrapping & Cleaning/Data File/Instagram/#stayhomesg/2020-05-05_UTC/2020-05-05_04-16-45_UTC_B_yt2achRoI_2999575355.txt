While we #stayhomesg , here are some tips for keeping your Harley ready for the next ride.
.
TIP 1: Wash your bike.
A thorough cleaning, waxing and oiling before storage will help prevent debris corrosion and water spots.
.
TIP 2: Shift your bike.
Prevent flat spots on your tyres by shifting your bike around weekly. This also sends the message to would-be mischief makers that the bike is being attended to!
