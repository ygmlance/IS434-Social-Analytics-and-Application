One thing I love about hand bounded books is the ability to rebind them. Some friends told me that recipients of hand binded books often don't bear to use them because they were so beautiful. But the truth is, after you fully use a hand bounded book, you can replace them again easily by removing the threads and rebinding them with new sheets! That really sparks the difference between factory made vs handbound books.

This secret belgium notebook does exactly that. Not only does it allow users to fold the covers all the way to the back, the beautiful wooden covers can be re-used to stitch new signatures when it is fully used. ðŸ˜ƒ

Less than a week before Mother's Day. Have you gotten her something to show your appreciation? ðŸ¤—
