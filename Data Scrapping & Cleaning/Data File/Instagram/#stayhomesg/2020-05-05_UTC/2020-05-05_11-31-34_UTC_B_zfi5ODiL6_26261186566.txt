Suffering is a pandemic we cannot avoid. How can we face and overcome suffering? Why suffering? Why me? Why now? 
Pastor Christopher Chia shares 9 devotions on “Walking with God through Suffering.” These timely podcasts on suffering as we face Covid19 are reflections from the book of Job. They were first recorded in 2010. Listen and be blessed. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
