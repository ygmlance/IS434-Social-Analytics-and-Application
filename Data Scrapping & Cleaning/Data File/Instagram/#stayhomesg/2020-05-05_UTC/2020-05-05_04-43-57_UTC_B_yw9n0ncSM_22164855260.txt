It's Cinco de Mayo! A holiday that celebrates the victory of the Mexican army over France at the Battle of Puebla.  Honestly, while living stateside, we remember it as the day where music & margaritas are flowing in the streets. Bring this fiesta vibe to your own home, swipe left for some inspiration and order some takeout #CantinaCulture today!
