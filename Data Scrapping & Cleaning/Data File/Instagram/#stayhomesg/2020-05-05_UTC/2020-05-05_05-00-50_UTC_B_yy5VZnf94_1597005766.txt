Sometimes it's challenging to plan dishes with two different eating habit's people in the family. Luckily, only two of us. He is a meat eater (preferred stir-fry and fried), I'm quite a vege and seafood eater (preferred boil and steam). If our daily's food is require to fulfill both of our eating habits, we will be quite broke by now. Haha.

I came to a point, I'm trying out taste with what we can afford and what we can utilise in a single dish. With internet these days, I would say it has became very convenient when we are in need of knowledge or recipes. You can learn online how to prepare ingredients, how you can make simple to advanced dishes.

Sometimes online recipes doesn't match our eating habits, so that's when new creation and new tastes comes along. A new taste we create in our little world (#stayhome) ... Here's Salmon Capsicum Miso Soup recipe: https://sgfoodwanderers.blogspot.com/2020/05/recipe-salmon-capsicum-miso-soup.html
