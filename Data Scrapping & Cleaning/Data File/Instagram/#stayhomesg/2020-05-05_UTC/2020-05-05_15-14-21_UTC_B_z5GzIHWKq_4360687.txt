@CrystalJadeSG’s Parents’ Day sets—delicious, and even easier to love now with delivery options, and a 30% off takeaway promo—are back!
🔸
Pictured is the 4-pax set menu from Crystal Jade Hong Kong Kitchen with complimentary dessert of Double-boiled White Fungus with Red Dates and Chinese Almond. Super delighted to tuck into ‘Bi Feng Tang’ Live Prawn with Crispy Rice at home, travelled really well too; their Roasted Meat Combination Platter (Honey BBQ Pork, Roasted Duck, Crispy Pork Belly) is always great; real winner of the meal is the comforting, hearty Braised Shredded Seafood with Superior Thick Soup. 😍
🍴
Set menus for 2 to 10 people, ranging from five to eight dishes ($78 to $498), are available for both takeaway and delivery. From now till 31 May, enjoy 30% off by purchasing JPoints on estore.crystaljade.com (e.g. $100 worth at only $70) that you can use to immediately offset your bill.
