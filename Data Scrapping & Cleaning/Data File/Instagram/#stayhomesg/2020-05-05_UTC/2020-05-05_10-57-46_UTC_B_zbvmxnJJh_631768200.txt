Day 29 of Circuit breaker dinner. Organic pearl barley mixed with organic brown rice century egg porridge. 
Chopped up broccoli and carrots throw inside the pot.
Everything is cook in this thermal cooker.
Except the Roasted pork & Char Siew are ready cooked one from cold storage.
Yes. Even the hard boil egg too is cooked in the same pot.
Thrown in for 30 minutes. Took out to leave it to cool. 美美的。No stick on shell. Mixed with Hay bee hiam is another dish to go with porridge.

Can see IG story on the short Video.

I can declare on day 29 of Circuit breaker that i have found my best cooking partner. This Japan brand Thermos thermal cooker. So easy and save time to cook a meal.
Bought at Isetan in 2013 and only used for 3 times until this Circuit breaker then i am kind of rekindled with. 😁
Still good. I always like Japan brand there is only a reason. Lasting!
