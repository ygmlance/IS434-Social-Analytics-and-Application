“I am now more aware of my health in general. The knowledge gained at U.P. will definitely help me tremendously in creating a lifestyle that is healthy in the long run.

I am very proud of myself that I was able to pull myself through the whole process and achieved something I never believed I could do."⁠

After years of failed attempts, Terence finally achieved his dream physique in just 17 weeks at @upfitnesssg.⁠
.⁠
.⁠
He'd always dreamt of building a muscular and defined physique, but he knew that being sat at a computer all day wasn’t going to help.⁠
.⁠
.⁠
He tried to learn weight training on his own and even hired personal trainers, but the lack of results left him underwhelmed, disappointed and demotivated.⁠
.⁠
.⁠
But, after years of trying, all it took was 17 weeks of focus to sculpt a body he can still barely believe is his.⁠
.⁠
.⁠
"Over 17 weeks, I lost 13kg and reduced my body fat from 24% to 9%. I never thought such a transformation was possible, not to mention that it was done in a relatively short period of time."⁠
