More than any other times, NOW is the chance for us to be in the PRESENT moment. We are sure you have probably heard it multiple times before. And in our current 21st century lives, that is not easy! There's always something that comes up - exams, job interviews, internships, relationship issues, endless meeting at work, etc. 🤯🤯
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Given the fast pace of society, being anxious, stress, and unhappy is the already like the new norm. When actually, the solution to these problems is by being HERE and NOW! 😇✨

Like what Albert Einstein said: “I never think of the future. It comes soon enough.” 👏🏻👏🏻

By being in the present moment, you can appreciate the world more. For example, while eating you can say to yourself "The food I'm eating right now tastes good".
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Doing these small gestures and actions can also increase self compassion. And maybe, just maybe..... that can help us to be smarter, or become the next Albert Einstein. Who knows man??? 😏😉

So, remember, all that matters is right MEOW!😸
