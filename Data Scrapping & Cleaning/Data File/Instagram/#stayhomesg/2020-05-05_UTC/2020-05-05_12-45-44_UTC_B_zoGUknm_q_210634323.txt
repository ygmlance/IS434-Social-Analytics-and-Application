An ups and downs day. #day28 #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg 
Nowadays this girl is engross in free play... itâ€™s not a bad thing but when both of us need to work, we can hardly have free play with her.... still managed to do some activities with her. 
1-1 correspondence counting and recognising the number.

Stamping the number of items indicated in the numeral (She is into stamping lately). Stamping the letters of the alphabet (She managed to do it independently till letter L!) Memory game (did shapes today. Gonna change it to letters tomorrow.)
