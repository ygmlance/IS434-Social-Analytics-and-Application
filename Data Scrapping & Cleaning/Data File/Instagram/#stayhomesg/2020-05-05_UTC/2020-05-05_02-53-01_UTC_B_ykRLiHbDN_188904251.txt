So excited to share! I am so proud of the work that @shofco (Shining Hope for Communities) is doing to support the communities that stay in our Urban Slums, even more now, with their response and actions to #COVID19. Educating people at their water stations with information on the disease and encouraging them to wash their hands through their handwashing stations.

I am excited to announce that @ashepa_lifestyle will be working with SHOFCO on a permanent basis to raise awareness and funds across various projects. It is a matter close to our heart because part of our artisan team lives in Kibera, and it's core to my beliefs when I started Ashepa, to ensure the health and well being of our team and our community.

We recently donated some water tanks that will be distributed by SHOFCO in areas that require them. This image was sent by their site manager confirming receipt of the water tanks in Makuru slum, an area that desperately required them. We will share more photos as they come. 
SHOFCO was started by Kennedy Odede, who was born in Kibera and experienced hardships. He recognised that to overcome urban poverty is to overcome the core obstacles. If you haven't heard of them, please check them out on on their website: https://www.shofco.org

Ashepa is donating 20% of its sales towards the purchases of water tanks to help stop the spread of #COVID19 in Kenya.

Thanks for your support!  Chetna x
