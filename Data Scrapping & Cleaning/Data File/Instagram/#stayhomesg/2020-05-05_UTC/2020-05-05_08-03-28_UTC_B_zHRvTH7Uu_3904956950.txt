So my husband and I decided to do something goofy this circuit breaker. Found some old piano recording and put this thing together. Haha I kept laughing so much while making it. #cheapthrills for me. Haha 
Just to note: we have no training in synchronized swimming. We bought this pool for our little one.  Last 2 seconds cut off by IG. .
