#dirtyXFawn ♥ It's Instag Story Takeover Day ♥ 
𝗛𝘂𝗶 𝗘𝗻 @lavenderlarkspur, our lovely guest 😍🤩 for 28th May 𝗗𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘆 𝗡𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗫 𝗙𝗮𝘄𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝘀 series is allowing us to get up close and intimate with her day spent during the extended #CircuitBreakerSG

Will Hui En bake, dance for exercise or paint? Is she practicing better SUSTAINABILITY practices in her post #COVID19 #StayHomeSG period? Let's find out

While most of us have the luxury of staying in our comfortable 🏠 homes, many of us may be lamenting our plight. The boredom, the cancellation of holiday plans, the lack of social life. Here at @Fawnlabs, we have championed for the lower income families with our Recycle Bottles and Handwash for lower income families back in February because they are the vulnerable group

Fast forward to today, there is another vulnerable group that has surfaced. For Hui En, she is concerned about the Migrant Workers of Singapore, which here at Fawn Labs, we align with. COVID-19 has highlighted the systemic issues migrant workers have faced. Our homes were built while they left theirs behind in search of a better life. We like to take this opportunity to raise awareness of their sacrifices that contributed to where Singapore is today. Let's first and foremost support them in overcoming this pandemic, use our voices uniformly post-pandemic to ensure that we do not forget nor leave them behind. Let's work together to build a better community for Singapore!
