Truly, this pandemic has opened our eyes in the way we operate our businesses. ⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
As business owners, some may have learned the meaning of "don't put all your eggs in one basket" the hard way. 🥚⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
As employees, it is a time where you put your talents to the test, and remember the necessity of having more than one skill. ⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
I just read an article of how Tekka market sellers, through the help of IMDA, has officially gone online! 😱⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
"The process is pretty simple, really. One simply has to tune in to the live-stream and watch the sellers market their items and answer queries posted in the comments section of the live-stream. Orders can also be posted in the comments section and the page will reply with a summarised list of items and its total price."⁠⠀

Who would have thought that fish mongering would become an online affair!?⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
While some may choose to see this as a doomed future, you can choose to take this as gifted time. ⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Set one Knowledge goal to achieve by the end of the Circuit Breaker. This could be a technical skill, or certification that you'd like to get. Creating your future starts now.⁠⠀
