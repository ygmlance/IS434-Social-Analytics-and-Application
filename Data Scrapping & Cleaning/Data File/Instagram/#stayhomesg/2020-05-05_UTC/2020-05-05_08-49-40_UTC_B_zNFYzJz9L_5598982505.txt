We must admit that it is not easy consolidating orders manually. To date, we have served over hundreds of customers and yes, we sometimes unintentionally overlooked them.

We seek our customers' kind understanding and would appreciate it if they could reach out to us by sending a message on our social media pages. We always try to reply to everyone as soon as possible, even when they have just submitted their orders and wanted to check in to see if we have received them 🙂

To help us to be more efficient, please provide your name along with surnames, full addresses and building name (if any), a mobile number that is contactable through Whatsapp, be sure that your orders are above the minimum order for delivery, and placing your orders before the cutoff time.

Thank you for being patient and kind🙏🏼
May the Pork be with you 🤘🏼
