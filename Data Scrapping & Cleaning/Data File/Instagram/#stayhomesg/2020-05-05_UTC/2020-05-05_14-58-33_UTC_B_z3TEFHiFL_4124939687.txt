Rainy days call for soup! Herbal Bak Kut Teh with added garlic makes it flavourful and hearty. Usually this herbal type can add mushrooms, fried beancurds skin or taupok and some lettuces but decided to keep it simple.  Here I'm just using ready spice mix.

Other dishes are scramble eggs with tomato and kailan with oyster sauce.

I pass some soup to my SIL, and she add it into her porridge which makes the plain porridge so tasty and satisfying. You can also throw in noodles for the next meal! .
