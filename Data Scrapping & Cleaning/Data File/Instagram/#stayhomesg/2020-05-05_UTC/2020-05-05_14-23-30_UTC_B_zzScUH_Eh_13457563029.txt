I morph into a Masterchef-wannabe on weekends because that’s when I can find loads of time to experiment with all the recipes I’ve saved over the week.
.
I’m definitely not talented in this department but my loved ones are my best cheerleaders! They devour the food I cook like it’s the tastiest thing on earth - so that kind of gave me more impetus to continue my kitchen escapades 😝.
.
These are some of our favourites from last weekend!
.
🍞 The recipe says this is the best homemade bread but I’m really not sure - because it has a dense texture while I like my bread fluffy. What I’m affirmative about is that this loaf is really scrumptious when eaten warm and fresh, and using maple syrup gave every bite a very lovely hint of sweetness! 👋🏼 By the way, that’s my baby grabbing bread off the board while I took a quick shot 😂.
.
🍜 I cannot describe how comforting it is to slurp a good bowl of noodles doused with sauce simmered to perfection! This Zha Jiang Mian 炸酱面 recipe has been my go-to for a while now and it is really simple!
.
🇬🇷 The best of all was Sunday when we went Mediterranean for all 3 meals. No pictures cuz all we wanted was to quickly enjoy our food. Oven-baked rice, homemade dips, roasted meats, wraps and herb infusions. I was half expecting the kids to reject my advances, but they totally approved this unfamiliar cuisine. 😋 It was all happy faces and yummy tummies!
.
😉 Get the recipes from the link in my bio - I’ll keep them till the end of May.
.
📚 For your Mediterranean fix, I recommend reading this wonderful cookbook (I picked up from @publiclibrarysg ). Swipe ⬅️ to check it out. It has all the information you need to know about this cuisine and recipes so easy to follow.
.
And man, my weighing scale ran out of battery two weeks ago and I’m definitely not gonna replace them any time soon!
