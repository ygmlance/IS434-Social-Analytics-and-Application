Started out from humble beginnings doing covers & originals on Soundcloud, Singer/Songwriter Zalelo now has 4 singles featuring “Stay Away”, “Better” and Jagiya, which was number 1 on RIA89.7FM for 3 weeks. The R&B Princess who was part of The Great Singapore Replay dreams to use her voice to spread love & comfort to others. Expressing herself through writing & singing is a breezy process for Zalelo, so she hopes to release an EP very soon to let you connect with her better. Catch her on #TheRoomSession this coming friday!
