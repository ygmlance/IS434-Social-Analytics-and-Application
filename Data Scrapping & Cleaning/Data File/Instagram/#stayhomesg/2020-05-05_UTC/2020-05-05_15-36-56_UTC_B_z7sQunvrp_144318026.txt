Today is day 1 without hbl. Kids take a break while I still #wfh for now. We celebrated with BK dinner last night. It's also a start of new habits to develop slowly. Kiddos have been taking turns serving each other water every morning. So today they started sweeping own rooms. We have 1 kid to sweep our room. Yays. Lol.
Am also working on a fragrant art! Will share more when I'm ready!
