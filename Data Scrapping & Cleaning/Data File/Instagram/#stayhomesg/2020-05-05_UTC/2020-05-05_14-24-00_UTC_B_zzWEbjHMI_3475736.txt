Day 29 of circuit breaker, water play for little Leodys. Saw this water toys recommended by one of mummy group, faster went over to Taobao to grab it. It just arrive via @vpostofficialsg. Even in this tight situation, I am glad that I am using vPost for my shipping. It is trustworthy and reliable. I had been hearing some of my friendsâ€™ parcel lost or delay quite long from other shipper. So far I do not face such issue with vPost. Lepdys still does not really know how to pour water to play, he kept arranging the toys from one holder to another. I really like how small it is, just nice fit my toilet. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #hbl #homebasedlearning #sensoryplay #waterplay #vpost #vpostsg #shipandsave #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #hangontuez
