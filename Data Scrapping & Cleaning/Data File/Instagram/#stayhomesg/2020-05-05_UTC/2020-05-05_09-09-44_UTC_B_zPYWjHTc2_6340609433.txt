12pcs BBQ Pork Bun, $9.80 from 𝐒𝐰𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐰 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐟𝐨𝐨𝐝 ⠀
⠀
In our earlier post, we had posted that we bought fresh and chilled dim sum from Swatow Seafood. Today we steamed 3pcs of BBQ Pork Bun for our tea break! The bun is super soft like those traditional dim sum and fillings is rather full! There’s real bits of char siew in it and it’s not too dry, there’s some moisture and slight gravy in it. It was so good that we continue to steam another 3pcs more as it wasn’t enough! ⠀
