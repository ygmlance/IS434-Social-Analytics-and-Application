My #circuitbreaker routine!

In the day:
24/7 devoted mommy to #twoboys + sneak some time to clear urgent emails. But you will realise, the time in the day is forever short.

My new official working hours became 11pm till late. AND! The little one just got to have some sensor alarm, crawl out of bed, walk out of the room to give me a shock here and then, now and there whenever Iâ€™m not sleeping beside him. ðŸ¥´

Well, how cute? Lying back down on bed with him, not a sound, he hugged me and go back to lala-land almost immediately.

Ok! Back to working desk for the 3rd time tonight. ðŸ¥± Time check: 1.25am.
