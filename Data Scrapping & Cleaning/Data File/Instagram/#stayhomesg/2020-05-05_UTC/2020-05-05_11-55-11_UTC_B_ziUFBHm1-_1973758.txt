Hey friends!!! GuitarStreet Live #5 is taking place this Saturday 9PM as usual, except this time it's SPECIAL. We're gonna do something BRAND NEW and REALLY EXCITING 😎🤩😍
.
I've invited 2 of my friends - Mermaid @iamnotagirl and Songwriter @pewristic to join me on the show, and I really can't wait. Mermaid is gonna swoon you over with her rendition of classic oldies, and Pew will get you grooving with her original songs about life. More importantly, there's gonna be lots of nonsense (I heard) so make sure you come for some laughs and great music!!

The LIVE link will be posted on Facebook: facebook.com/guitarstreet.sg -- See you there!!
