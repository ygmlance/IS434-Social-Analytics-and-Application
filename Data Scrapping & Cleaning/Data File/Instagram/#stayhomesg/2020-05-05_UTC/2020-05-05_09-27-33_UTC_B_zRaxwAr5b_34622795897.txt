Circuit breaker lunch - homemade simple pizza bread topped with succulent prawns, savory bacon, mushrooms, onions on a bed of garlic butter cream cheese and mozzarella & cheddar cheese. Yumz 🍕 Wanted to do a Hawaiian version but I couldn’t open the canned pineapples with the can opener at home so I gave up and replace it with prawns instead HAHAHA 🙂 #foodblog #singaporehomecooks #pizza #jigglyjiggscook #stayhomesg #circuitbreaker #asian
