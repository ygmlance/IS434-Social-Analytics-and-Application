开饭了！
Plum Stewed Duck 🦆 and Baked Beans Egg 🥚 for dinner tonight 
Have slogged in the kitchen stewing the duck. I have learnt this recipe from a HK chef. 
Stewing the ducky for almost three hours with all the chinese aromatics, pickled plum n sour plum. The meat just fell off from the bone. 
Really loving it...
