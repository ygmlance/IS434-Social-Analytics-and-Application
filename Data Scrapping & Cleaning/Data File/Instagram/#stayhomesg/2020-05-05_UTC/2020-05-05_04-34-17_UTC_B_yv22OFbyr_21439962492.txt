A few days ago, this couple came by to our restaurant and donated $100 anonymously. They didn’t leave their name or contact, but we just want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to them. We would also like to thank everyone else for your contribution! Your help really made a difference! ✨ If you would like to make a contribution, you can Paynow with the QR code in the picture above or type in the UEN: 201821224D. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
