It is Mother’s Day this Sunday, and if you are worried of what to get or do for her during this circuit breaker, fret not. We have prepared a 3-Part Mother’s Day Special for you to prepare something to give the Women-of-the-House a memorable time. Everything will be done from the heart, and your mom will certainly give you a 100-point for the effort you go through during #StayHomeSG.

Nothing beats a homemade breakfast to kick-start the day! Reward her with a good café-style #StayHome D.I.Y. breakfast/brunch. We are going to show you (see video) how to make the hollandaise sauce at home and keep it warm, plus the full recipe to the Eggs Benedict. Enjoy and have fun doing boomerang with that oozy egg yolk!

See comment for recipe.
