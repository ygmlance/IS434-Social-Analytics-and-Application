🍴Overall ease: 8/10
.
🛒Ingredients: chicken thighs, basmati rice, mixed spices, currants, onions, cilantro, avocado yogurt sauce
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: Recipe from @ottolenghi #jerusalem cookbook. 
1. Caramelise onions for 15 mins.
2. Remove and sear the chicken for 5 minutes.
3. Remove, add rice, mixed spices, and currants, and lay the chicken on top.
4. Cook with the lid on for another 30 mins, and serve with fresh cilantro, lightly pickled onions, and avocado yogurt sauce (which we had left over)
.
😋Taste: 10/10. Classic ottolenghi recipe. Perfect balance of salty and sweet. So warm and comforting, and easy to throw together. We added on an avocado yogurt herb sauce which we had leftover from an earlier dish, and it provided the bright sour citrus notes that some of us really enjoyed. Overall, highly recommend!
