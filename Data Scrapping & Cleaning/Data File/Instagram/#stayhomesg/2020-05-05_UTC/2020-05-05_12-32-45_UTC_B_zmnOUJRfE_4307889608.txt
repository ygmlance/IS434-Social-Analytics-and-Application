“Of course we can’t compare with the people who do this professionally, but I wasn’t nervous and livestream was actually quite easy. Just selling only mah!” - Auntie Janet (lady in first photo), the owner of 81 Sheng Yu, one of six stalls in Tekka Market that went on livestream today to sell their produce. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The stall owners we spoke to also said that sales have fallen up to 70% since the circuit breaker measures kicked in because people were afraid to visit the wet markets. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
“I wasn’t very worried, because it wasn’t just me, all other stalls also had reduced business. I just had to take things one step at a time.” - Auntie Janet.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The stall owners were all first-time livestreamers, but they managed to get over a thousand views and sold out their products within an hour of air time.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Uncle Mustafa (man on right in fifth photo) even wore his best shirt today ;) ⁣
⁣
OG wet market livestreamer, Max from Lian Huat Seafood, was also roped in to help guide these uncles and aunties. “In doing live, it’s most important to present your items authentically. Jiayou, jiayou (Press on)!” ⁣⁣
