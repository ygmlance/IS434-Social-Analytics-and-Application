This video (and subsequent vids) will show me learning the whole songs so it will be diff frm the previous 2 that I posted earlier. So, I may not post myself doing the mistakes in other videos, including this one, and straight away show the so-called end product. I could've post the mistakes but it will lengthen the vid. If u guyz wan me to film the mistakes, feel free to suggest yeah!!!🔥🙆
