⁣Golden fried rice is actually my favorite variation of fried rice because I love eggs and somehow fried rice is not one of those things I really plan for, it just happens, and this one requires probably the least amount of ingredients(the prawn is optional)⠀

You can get very technical with how you fry the rice but the recipe itself has not much to it, just separate the yolks and mix them into rice, beat more whole eggs into the leftover egg whites and use that as the 'scrambled egg', and use a combination of salt and soy sauce to season because all soy will discolour the rice too much. ⠀

Also there is a misconception that you HAVE to use leftover rice to make good fried rice. I remember reading a Q&A with a chef that had worked at some Chinese restaurants here in singapore and they use freshly cooked rice while making fried rice, the difference is that they make two batches of rice- a regular batch for guests to eat plain, and a separate batch for fried rice where the rice is cooked with less water. Overnight rice is good because it drys out in the fridge, but you can also use a fresh batch of rice cooked slightly more dry to have a similar effect
