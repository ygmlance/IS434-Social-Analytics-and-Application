Coming together for breakfast as a family has always been something I rememeber fondly till now in my adulthood... On weekends, mum would shout at us and get us out of bed, we would sit around the dining table, tired and restless. 
Breakfast is served to our face, sometimes I will just gobble whatever is served while other times I complain like a royalty..... This CB has changed the way we used to live and will change the future that we live in. 
But one thing remains for sure, is that .
