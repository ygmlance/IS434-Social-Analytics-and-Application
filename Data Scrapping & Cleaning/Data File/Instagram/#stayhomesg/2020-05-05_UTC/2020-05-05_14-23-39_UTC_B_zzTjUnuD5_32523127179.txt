👩🏻‍🍳Process: Make the crumble by mixing butter, sugar, and flour together and set aside. For the batter, mix butter and sugar until well combined. Mix dry ingredients - flour, salt, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda - with sourdough discard and 2 beaten eggs. Combine both mixtures, and bake it for 45 to 60 minutes at 170 degrees. For the sauce, simmer frozen berries over low heat till it thickens (no need for additional sugar or lemon juice)

😋Taste: 7/10. Have been searching for a recipe to use up sourdough discard meaningfully and stumbled upon this @kingarthurflour one with multiple good reviews. The result was a crumble cake that was not too oily or sweet - almost like a scone, but with a sugary crumble topping. We decided to add a berry sauce for much needed sourness and moisture, and it became a perfect midday snack.

P.S it is also a perfect complement to a cup of coffee
