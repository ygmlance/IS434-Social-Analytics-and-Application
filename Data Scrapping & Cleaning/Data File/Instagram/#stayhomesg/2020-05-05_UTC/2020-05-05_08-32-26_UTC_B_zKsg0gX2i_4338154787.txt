Ayrissa & Mummy bakes! (edited in 1.6x speed)
NOT a professional baker. Bakes just for fun wif kiddos. Dunno to expect muffins or cookies out of it actually...
LOL🙃🤪😂🤣🥰🤩😍
Bakes not for sale. Didnt refer to any recipe. Just use whatever ingredients available n just throw in (by feeling), no specific measurements. Taste a few times along the way n add in sugar n salt accordingly so that wont be sweet overload.
