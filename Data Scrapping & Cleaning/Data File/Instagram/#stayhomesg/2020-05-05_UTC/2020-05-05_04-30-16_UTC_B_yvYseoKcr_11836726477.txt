How is your first day of school holidays?
.
I personally do not feel like it is the holidays because we still need to observe the social distancing measures and stay home whenever we can.
.
For those who are not informed of the revised academic calendar, here you go!
.
Please still try to stay at home and participate in some stay-home fun activities like cooking, baking etc.
.
Have fun!
