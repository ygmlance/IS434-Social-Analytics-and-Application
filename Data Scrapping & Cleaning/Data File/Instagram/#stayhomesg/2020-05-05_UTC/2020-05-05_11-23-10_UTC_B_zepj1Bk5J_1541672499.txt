I am so blessed and Thankful to have a Mini Iftar Buffet with my dearest family by @onandondiners yesterday! It is our very first time trying their dishes and we are so surprised that it is really delicious and definitely suits our tastebuds! All of the dishes are so yummy and tasty! I asked each and every one of my family member to atleast find one negative feedback but to NONE. We really had a great time bonding over their mini buffet. We always had a tough time on deciding what to cook or what to buy for Buka every single morning but guise, its completely hassle free to order with their tip top service! 
Did i not say that they does daily delivery for iftar buffet too? YES THEY DO!! So do check out their various menus that you could customise yourself and enjoy in the comfort of your own home. DO CHECK OUT MY HIGHLIGHTS FOR MORE VIDEOS! 
THANK YOU AGAIN TO @onandondiners ðŸŒ¸
