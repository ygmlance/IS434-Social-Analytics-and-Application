How have you been feeling lately? 😊⁠
⁠
Emotions can change our heart rate, breathing rate, hormone levels and even create tension in the body. 😖⁠
⁠
Similarly, our body movements can also make changes to our emotions. 🤸⁠
⁠
To change the state of the mind, engage your body. ⁠
Do some sports, exercise or even jumping jacks.🏋️‍♀️🏃‍♀️⁠
⁠
Moving consciously helps to us to get out of the loop and even feel happier 🤗⁠
