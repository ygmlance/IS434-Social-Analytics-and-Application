STAY HOME is a song that was released on the 24th of April that saw a collaboration of 14 of our very own local artistes, accompanied with a music video, all done in 11 DAYS! ðŸ¤¯

The music video has amassed more than 180,000 views and the spotify plays just keep raking up!

For all those who haven't checked it out, this single is definitely an anthem for Singapore during these trying times. Listen to it today! âœ¨
