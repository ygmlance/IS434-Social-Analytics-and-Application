Day 29. Tea time snacks on Circuit breaker.
I am a fan of vegetables crackers.
I found this cute heart shaped crackers at Suntec city a couples of years back and fell in love with it.
It taste great and so pretty. Very appetising!
I will buy the biggest pack that i can get hold of to stock up.😁
During the Circuit breaker i managed to find these kids size pack at a Japanese essential shop.
I treasure every single "heart" that goes into my mouth.😁
Calbee please make it available at NTUC fair price. 
Thanks.
