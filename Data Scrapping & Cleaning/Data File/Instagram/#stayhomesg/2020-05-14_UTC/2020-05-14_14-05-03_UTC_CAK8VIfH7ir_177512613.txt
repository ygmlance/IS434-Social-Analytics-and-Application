Just looking at the photos made me hungry again. Look at this tantalising chicken from @cubalibresg! But wait... that's not all. Our lunch was actually from 4 different restaurants but booked directly with @sgdeliveryonline.

Just swipe and check out our spread of Indian, Persian and Mediterranean cuisines! Lol... we ended up having them for lunch and dinner! Very hearty indeed. I love the chicken nachos so much. The chicken briyani was great too but only for those who those spicy food.

They have free deliveries for quite a few locations on special days, so you make wish to check them out, especially if you have a craving for these delectable dishes! Thanks for sending love!
