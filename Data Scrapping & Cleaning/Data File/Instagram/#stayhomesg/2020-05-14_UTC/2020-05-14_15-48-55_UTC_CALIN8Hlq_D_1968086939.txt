Building a new FDM 3D printer from scratch using parts from #pxmalion
It took about 3 hours to assemble. Perhaps in the future @baelf_design could explore making a food printer or paint printer 😋🍭🌈🎨
Will be building another identical one soon to grow my 3D printing farm. Hoping to increase productivity and make up for lost time due to the pandemic😖
This printer uses glass as a printing plate so the print comes out with a super shiny bottom face 🤩✨ #diy #buildityourself #engineering #fff #fdm #3dprinting #3dprinter #screws #motor #nutsandbolts #wires #computing #productdesign #maker #designer #artist #stayhomesg #singapore #quarantine #hongkong #home #studio #lego #play #modular #programming #expansion #stepbystep #handson
