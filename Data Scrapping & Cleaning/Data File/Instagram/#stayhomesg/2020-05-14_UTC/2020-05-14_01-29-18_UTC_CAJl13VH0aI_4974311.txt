[13.05.20] Day 37 of #circuitbreaker:

Utterly impressed by how quickly @artpeacesg delivered the #omni soft pastels and stencils I ordered in the afternoon. They arrived in time for an 8pm session with Tr. Gina. I got to try out some new colors and put my new stencil to use! 
Here’s another cute piece I learned - thanks to these generous big-hearted Nagomi art Teachers who provide some free lessons to help keep people who stay at home sane..! #sgunited #stayhomeforsg #stayhome #stayhomesg #istayathome #sgparents #sgmoms #sgkids #missustaypaints #nagomiart #artpeacesg #softpastels
