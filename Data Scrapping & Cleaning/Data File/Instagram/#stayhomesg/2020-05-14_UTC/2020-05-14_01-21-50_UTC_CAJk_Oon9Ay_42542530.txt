Throwback to Motherâ€™s Day yoga with the Baby. 
This not-so-little-one turns my world upside down (#headstand ) , steps all over me (#headstep ) , goes head to head with me (#planking ) , but she fills our lives with fun and joy and things look up and brighter with her around. (#upwardfacingdog ) ðŸ¥°
