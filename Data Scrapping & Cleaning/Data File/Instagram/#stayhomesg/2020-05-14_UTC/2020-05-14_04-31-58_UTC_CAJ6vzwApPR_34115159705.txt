2am Dessert Bar is the creation of Chef Janice Wong – one of the best pastry chefs in Asia. She learned her pastry making skills with some of the the most widely acclaimed chefs in the world like Spanish chocolatier Oriol Balaguer and French pastry chef Pierre Hermé. .

We’re so thrilled to see Janice Wong’s rendition of the classic Italian cake on 2am Dessert Bar’s menu. Her version of tiramisu is definitely not a classic one. But hold on, that’s not a bad thing! This tiramisu looks deconstructed and served with Kahlua jelly and a scoop of espresso ice cream. Using Kahlua instead of the usual liqueur definitely gives the dessert a pleasantly unusual but familiar taste. .
