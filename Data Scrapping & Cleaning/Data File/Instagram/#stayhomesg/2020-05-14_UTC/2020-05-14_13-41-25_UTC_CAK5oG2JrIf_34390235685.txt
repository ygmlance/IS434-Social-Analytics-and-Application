Fancy some browned butter cookies? My 18 month old sure does! I made these specially for a wonderful sister who’s about to give birth soon. She’s got an absolute sweet tooth but has been watching her diet closely. Dr gave her the go-ahead to eat more. So I prepared some white choc (her fav) cookies, and did some mixed white and dark, as well as a batch with just dark choc. And oh, they all have chopped pecans for extra crunch. Because cookies.
