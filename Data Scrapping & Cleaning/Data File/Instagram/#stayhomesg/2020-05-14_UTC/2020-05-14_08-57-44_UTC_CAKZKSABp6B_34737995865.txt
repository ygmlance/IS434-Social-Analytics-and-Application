Specially drove to the east today to takeaway prawn noodles and wu xiang from Beach Road Prawn Mee for lunch. Have been patronising them for many years but this is the first time I have done takeaway from them. Everything was still good even though it’s takeaway and I like how a meal satisfies my cravings for prawn noodles and wu xiang at the same time! 😁
