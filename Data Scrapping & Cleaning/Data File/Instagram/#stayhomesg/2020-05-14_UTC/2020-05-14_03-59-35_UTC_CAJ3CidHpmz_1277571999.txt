Putting in 5 fun and easy activities in a single post, for your little one to explore during this home bound period.

1. Ladle and soup.
Just ladle. No hands of course, soup is ‘hot!’ And the pot is one from the real kitchen.

2. Trace the shadow
A sunny day activity by the window, where the sun shines. Place some animals or any small figurines on a paper and trace their shadows.

3. Egg drawing
Save the egg shells used from cooking and baking for this drawing purpose. Poke a hole with chopsticks at the bottom of the shell, to release its content.

4. Chopsticks skills
Chopsticks and poms poms make great fun. Pick away!

5. Roads and cars
Draw roads, tracks and traffic lights on a flattened box and bring in the toy cars to play away!

Have a great time of fun!
