🌱I have smelt all the aromas there are in the fragrant Kitchen they called Earth; and what we can enjoy in this life, I surely have enjoyed just like a lord!🌱 This quote is by the late German Poet-Heinrich Heine, who certainly have enjoyed life! I think during this CB, many of us are also enjoying the aromas of delicious home cooked food or bakes in our kitchens by our loved ones or ourselves! 😋🤣Today, I decided to dine like a Tai Tai and had the idea of creating a high class breakfast using my leftover Gardenia banana walnut bread. So I brought into my kitchen probably the world most well-known luxurious motif from Louis Vuitton! 🤪 It was a fully concentrated 30 minutes spent drawing the LV monogram on my bread with just chocolate syrup and a bamboo skewer. At the same time, it felt very therapeutic to take my mind off everything else that’s happening. 😌I’m quite pleased with the end results! 🥰 Also, pairing with my most high-class Noritake teacup with warm honey drink! 😆 It’s back to work and I hope we can all accomplish what we want to do today! 🤗🤗🤗
