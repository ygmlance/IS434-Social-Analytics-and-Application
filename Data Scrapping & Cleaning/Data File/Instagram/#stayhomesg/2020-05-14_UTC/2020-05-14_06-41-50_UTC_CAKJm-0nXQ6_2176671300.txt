Our Kudzu Root Starch is made from mountain kudzu roots that are 5-10 years old. After kudzu roots are gathered, they are ground, washed and steamed. Kudzu is a good alternative cooking starch for corn starch (most corn is GMO), or starch from potato, wheat, or sweet potato. They have medicinal values which help strengthen digestive systems. Kudzu Root Starch is added to make gravy, soup starchy. When ground to powder, it is also traditionally used for tempura
