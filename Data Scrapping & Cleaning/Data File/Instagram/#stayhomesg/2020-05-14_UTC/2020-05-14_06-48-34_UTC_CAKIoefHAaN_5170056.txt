Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ve been munching last week, our home cooked dishes.
If you ever run out of ideas, hope these are some dishes that can spice up your menu! #sharingiscaring ðŸ’›

1. Leek Pork Potato
Chef Baobei dish this & I couldnâ€™t stop munching after. Itâ€™s deeeelicious

2. Herbal Fish Soup
Comfort food. We are soup lovers! Are you?

3. Fried Petai with Ikan Bilis & Shrimps
& of course a mix with Sambal Belacan on my share. Cannot do without. Do not compromise, my chillilover comrades.

4. Salted Egg Yolk Fried Rice
This my first attempt & Iâ€™m a salted egg lover, & now itâ€™s listed on my Favourite.
I highly recommend you to try it.

5. Drunken Herbal Prawn
One full kilos of drunken prawns. 
Finger licking food, & that juice in the pot with a bowl of rice is our absolute love. Soaked our rice bowl in with the juice & itâ€™s heavenly. The thought & these words made me salivate ðŸ¤¤

6. Japanese Sweet Potato
Natural sweet thing. The faint honey taste. Baked or steam, this dish can not go wrong.
My dog loves it too.

7. Sesame Oil Minced Pork Mee Sua
Oh, the whiff of sesame oil in the mee sua is addictive. A season dish. My quick fix for something flavourful. Simple & quick dish. ðŸ’›ðŸ’›ðŸ’› Details of recipes on InstaStories
