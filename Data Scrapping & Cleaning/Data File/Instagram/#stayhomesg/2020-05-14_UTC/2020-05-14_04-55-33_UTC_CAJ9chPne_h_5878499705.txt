Waddap! Itâ€™s Talking Thursday! Woohoo! I know what day it is! ðŸ¤£

So today, letâ€™s talk about light. I find it very interesting how these 3 pictures are taken at the same location but with just a change of angles and how you move the camera, you can play with natural light to give you different vibes in each photo!

Kinda cool huh? Which one do you prefer out of the 3?

Besides playing around with light, we also ate a cute Totoro cream puff! I was lucky that my airbnb was a nice walk away from this cafe & the cream puffs are not only cute, they taste good too. ðŸ¤¤ Ah... I sure miss travelling. ðŸ¥º
