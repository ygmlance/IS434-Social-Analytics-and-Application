INCABERRIES -- These super berries are known as the 'healthy sour skittles' due to the unique combination of sweet and sour. Firstly, you get a burst of sweetness followed by a sour aftertaste.

Incaberries are high in fibre - in fact, they have the highest fibre content of all dried fruits! They contain both insoluble and soluble fibre - insoluble fibre for healthy bowels function, while soluble fibre helps increase satiety.

Incaberries are extremely high in antioxidants, vitamin C, iron, potassium and protein.

There are many ways to eat these super berries - add to your granola, scones, energy balls, salads, use as meat stuffing, or simply as a snack!
