Are you working out from home during this pandemic? I am a #gymrat ...happy to say that I am slowly getting into the groove of working out at home. BUT I still miss the squat racks. Have a blessed Thursday everyone. Take care and stay safe. Try to stay active and exercise. #chestandtriceps #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #homeworkouts #workoutmotivation #momeholiftsweights #momwholifts #fitmummy #fitafter40 #fitnessmommy #exerciseathome #sweatyselfie #postworkoutselfie #postworkoutglow #stayhealthyandfit #healthandfitnessjourney #healthandfitnessgoals #ectomorph #bodytypetraining #strongnotskinny #leangains #tryingtobuildmuscles #exercisemotivation #survivingcovid19 #covid19 #missthegym #gymlifestyle #workingoutfromhome
