Hi all, Chee Mun here. I've started a new initiative called #LightUpSG, https://www.facebook.com/events/558644671458189/ 
I’m inviting everyone to put up your festive lights at your windows and turn them on for the eve of Hari Raya Puasa, to let our Muslim friends know that while they may not be able celebrate Hari Raya normally, we celebrate the day with them. But more importantly, we put up your lights to remember we are in this together, as one Singapore. 
If we can’t light up our streets, let’s #LightUpSG.
