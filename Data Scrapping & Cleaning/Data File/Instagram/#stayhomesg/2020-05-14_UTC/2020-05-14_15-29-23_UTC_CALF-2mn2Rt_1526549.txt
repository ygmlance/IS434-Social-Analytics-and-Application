Stay home expectation vs reality.

With the announcement of the mandated COVID-19 stay home measures, I had all these plans to be productive, to reflect, read, craft, strategize and develop the business. But the reality is, I spend most of my time and energy with Izzy as her human pillow, her non-stop musical box, her teacher and clown, and her free-flow milk buffet with baby fingers all up in my face and constantly down my shirt.

Plans do not always go as expected, and I have to remind myself that maybe... that is, in fact, the actual plan. I have taken many steps back, started to ask the "Why?", and simply learnt to find joy in the everyday. The focus now is to make as many happy memories with Izzy, knowing that we will never have this time with her at this cute age again.

Some days are better than others, but I trust the process and enjoy the little things, and am grateful for all that we have now. We are almost out of the circuit breaker so I'm cherishing this opportunity where I have the luxury of time to spend with family. Maybe it is time for a new plan indeed ðŸ’¡
