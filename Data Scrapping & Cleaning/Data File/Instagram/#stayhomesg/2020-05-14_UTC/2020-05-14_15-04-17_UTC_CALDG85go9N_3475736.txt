Day 38 of circuit breaker, my little kitchen helper strike again. After his lunch, we let him have some screen time so we can pluck our vegetables. When he saw what we are doing, he insisted to help which I am glad to let him try. See this fellow, like adult, plucking vegetables and seeing show at the same time. I will try my best to let him help out in our daily chores as much as possible.  Letting him learn real life skill which is outside of textbook, so he will know what to do when he grow up. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #pluckingveggies #lifeskills #lifeskillforkids #littlekitchenhelper #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
