Although @nana_bake could only fulfill our order for a post-anniversary celebration due to the circuit breaker tightened measures. I am so glad that we eventually recieved the DIY cake and the girls had a fun #stayhomeactivity decorating the cake! ⁣

What's included in the DIY cake set:⁣
🌟 1 x 4 inch cream cake⁣
🌟 5 Meringue Kisses⁣
🌟 4 Marshmallow ⁣
🌟 2 Mini Macaroons ⁣
🌟 2 pack of Sprinkles⁣
🌟 2 bags of Deco⁣
🌟 1 set Happy Birthday (we change it to Happy Anni!) ⁣
⁣
All we had to do is to pop open the box and we were ready to explore our creativity with the DIY cake! ⁣
