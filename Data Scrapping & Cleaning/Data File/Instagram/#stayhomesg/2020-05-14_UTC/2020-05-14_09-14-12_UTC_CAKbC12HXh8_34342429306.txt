I love kimchi! Salad and kimchi will try them with seaweed. Been focusing on my nutrition and try to choose healthier options. Not very strict with what I eat, just surprisingly enjoying salad at the moment. 
Also trying to be active, though I feel my knees are better but after the workout I feel I add some stress on to it. It feels heavy. Hope it will fully recover soon. That's all for now. 
Stay safe and healthy! ‚ù§V
