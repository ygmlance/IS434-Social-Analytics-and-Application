Bought really cheap and fresh lala clams from this uncle at Blk 628, Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 market. The clams were already cleaned and purged of sand. Didnâ€™t have to do much except to cook and eat. Yummy!  #vongole #angmokioave4blk628 #stayhomesg #sgunited #pasta #lala #sgburpple #sgfoodstagram #sgfoodies
