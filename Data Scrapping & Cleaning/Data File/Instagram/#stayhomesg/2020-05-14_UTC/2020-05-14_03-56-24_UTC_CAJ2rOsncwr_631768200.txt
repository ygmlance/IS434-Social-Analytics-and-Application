Day 38 of Circuit breaker.
My #jasmine_kitty_kitchen is open again. 
I decided to do this cute Hello Kitty Sandwiches with my Gardenia 100% Wholemeal Extra Soft & Fine Bread.
Tutorial is on the last two pics.
Ingredients are bread, luncheon meat, omelette, Sunny side up egg.
For garnished are Lettuces & cherry tomatoes.
Have fun doing it with your kids anyway it is still the school holidays, any cutter or mould is not an issue here, can use vegetarian Ham or Halah Ham too. Any one can do. Try it. ðŸ˜Š
