We want to give back to all the powerful heroes that have been unconditionally giving their all for us. As the first hotel group donor, we have partnered up with @singaporesidecars to provide hot meals and treats to hospitals and medical centers in Singapore to support our medical professionals.

This May, The St. Regis Singapore delivered Mother's Day treats to our healthcare heroes at the Singapore General Hospital. A huge thank you from us to you, for all that you do.
