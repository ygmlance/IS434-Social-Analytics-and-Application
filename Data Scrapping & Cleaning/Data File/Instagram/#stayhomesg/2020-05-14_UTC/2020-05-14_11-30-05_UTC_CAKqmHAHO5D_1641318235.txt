I've a love-hate relationship with fish oil capsules. Regular fish oil capsules are either too huge to swallow, or give me fishy breathe after, meh! 🐟⁣

Happy to be introduced to @OceanHealthSg High Strength Omega-3 Vitamin D3 Enriched! 🤩⁣
⁣
It is an odourless formula with natural lemon flavour that delivers the dual action of Omega-3 fish oil AND Vitamin D3! Even though it's a smaller mini soft gel (compared to regular fish oil), it contains 50% more Omega-3 fatty acids (461mg EPA+DHA), wow. Derived from 100% natural Omega-3-rich deep sea fish, every batch undergoes stringent testing for heavy metals and microbial contaminants to provide high purity fish oil. In times like this, the added Vitamin D3 will support various body functions, including immunity, heart health, bone health and muscle strength. ❤️💪⁣
⁣
Each bottle of 60 mini soft gels retails at $29.90, available at major retail pharmacies and online stores. From now till 31 May 2020, enjoy 35% off @OceanHealthSg's official store @shopee_sg when you check out with our code <<OCEAKAREN>>.⁣
