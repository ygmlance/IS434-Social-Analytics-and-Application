So I have been a bit lazy recently. Trying to follow the inspiring Aaron Kwok concert video, learning the new + old choreography(but his signature moves stuck forever). Not sure if it's correct or not but I agar agar, just needed to dance along to his motivating moves! Kudos to #偶像 & his dancers in mask 🙏🏻👏🏻 辛苦了! 
Hope we can continue to learn & do things we love regardless of age ! 😭 *𝙸 𝚍𝚘 𝚗𝚘𝚝 𝚘𝚠𝚗 𝚊𝚗𝚢 𝚌𝚘𝚙𝚢𝚛𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝𝚜 𝚝𝚘 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚖𝚞𝚜𝚒𝚌*
