Lobster Bisque 🦞
.
🍴Overall ease: 6/10
.
🛒Ingredients: recipe adapted from @seriouseats 
Spiny lobsters (preciously on sale from @maxzi.sg)
1 cup of chicken stock
1 onion, 5 garlic cloves, 3 carrots 
Butter, oil, white wine, tomato paste, bay leaf, heavy cream (to taste)
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: 
1. Steam the lobsters just enough to remove the meat.
2. Keep the meat in the fridge and fry the shells with butter & oil.
3. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, 1 tbsp of tomato paste, and 2 bay leaves, and simmer for ~1hr.
4. Hand crush the lobster shells with warm water to extract every last drop of lobster flavour (note: we prefer not to blend as blending adds a weird creaminess).
5. Sieve the stock and blend with heavy cream, as well as the simmered vegetable base for extra flavour and thickness.
.
😋Taste: 8/10. #lobsterbisque has always been a family favourite and we succeeded in achieving a delicious and smooth broth that was rich in seafood flavour. Making it ourselves from scratch also meant that we could control the level of creaminess. Although our broth was on the thinner side, we are already looking forward to attempting this again, and to incorporate rice/ flour as a thickener.
