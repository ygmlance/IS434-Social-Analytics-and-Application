What do you want to do with mummy today?
J: Mmmm... dunno.... Me: How about trying out the famous amos recipe??
J: Big beaming grin.
In the middle of the baking session i had to draw deep breaths to restrain myself from scolding further... stop jumping...pour properly! Now the flour measurement is off....
After lowering my expectations, we made it! It was actually a Very easy process! Just that this boy had his jumping beans in him. Nontheless we made it!! It was really like the fragrant and famous amos choc chip cookie!! We were so proud of the crispy cookies. Since it was dinnertime, i only allowed 3pcs per person. Then cooled the batch and had 3 containers full. Left 3. You know where they went... it was really irresistible. So i had to quickly put them aside for our famous amos teatime dunk in milk tomorrow!
