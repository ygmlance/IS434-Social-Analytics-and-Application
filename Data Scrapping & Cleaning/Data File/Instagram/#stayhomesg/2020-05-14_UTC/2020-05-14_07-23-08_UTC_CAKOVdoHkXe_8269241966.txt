Made my own earl grey macchiato! One of my favorite drinks from bubble tea menu. Heh... next time no need to order from BBT shop already la! So easy and so cheap to make! Just need whipping cream, milk, sugar and salt and your favorite tea! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ Pro tip: I made ice cubes using the tea so my tea stays cold and doesn't get diluted! Yay!
