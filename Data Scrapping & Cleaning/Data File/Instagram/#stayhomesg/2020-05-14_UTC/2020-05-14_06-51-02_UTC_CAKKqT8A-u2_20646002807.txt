Shinsekai Doteyaki - Simmered Beef with Miso 
A famous Osaka Speciality - this tastes way better than it looks. Truth be told, I have not tasted the original version, this recipe was introduced by a good friend - @dewreanne. But what a gem of a recipe! The miso mirin infused stew is nutritious and delicious. It‚Äôs going to make infinite more appearances at the dinner table.

To make it a one dish meal, I added Korean rice cakes. The rice cakes upped the chewy index of the dish and added to its appeal.

Here‚Äôs my version (for 5-6 pax):
1Ô∏è‚É£ 1 kg beef tendon (couldn‚Äôt get tendon so I used frozen beef cubes), water to cover the meat, and 4 slices ginger - put in pressure cooker and cook. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Cut 1 (or 2) pieces of  konnyaku jelly into 1-2 cm dice. Boil it for 5 minutes to remove the smell and put aside.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Simmer sauce (3 tbsp miso paste, 600ml bonito based dashi stock, 4 tbsp mirin, 2 tbsp sake, 2 tbsp sugar).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Add the beef (cut into bite size), konnyaku and the Korean rice cakes. Simmer till rice cakes are soft. Serve with cut spring onions.
