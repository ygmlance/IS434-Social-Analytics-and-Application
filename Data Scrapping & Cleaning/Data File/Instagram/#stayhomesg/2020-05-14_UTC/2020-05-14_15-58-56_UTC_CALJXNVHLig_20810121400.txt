Baked chocolates oats!! Love this receipe cos its very easy and its my favourite chocolate HAHAHAH could eat this everyday just that I do not have bananas everyday ğŸŒš 
I actually baked the oats first and added chocolate chips on top and microwave it for a minute to melt it (or you can bake again). So it makes the baked oats having more options to add any toppings or any variations ğŸ˜¬

Receipe from @flourishnut ! She has alot of baked oats version but I guess I love chocolate the best ğŸ˜Œ
