[New Dinner Timeslot]

The May holidays are upon us! In the #stayhome edition of our popular Junior Lifeskills Camp, your children will learn to cook via a 2.5- hour live cooking sessions across 3 days. Running from Wednesday to Friday, 4.30pm to 7.00pm, we will guide them step-by-step to prepare dinner for the family.

All ingredients for the 3 cooking sessions will be delivered to your home on Tuesday, ready for the children to cook up a storm together.
