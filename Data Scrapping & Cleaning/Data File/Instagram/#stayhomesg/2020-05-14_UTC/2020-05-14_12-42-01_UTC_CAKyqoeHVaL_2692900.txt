Make a refreshing Yuzu Espresso Tonic at home. 
Instructions:
1. Add 2-3 teaspoons of yuzu concentrate to a tall glass.

2. Add some ice cubes (say 6-8 cubes). 3. Pour in around 200ml of tonic water.

4. Add in a shot of espresso (which is about 30ml). You may want a stronger mix with double shot.

5. You may want to further garnish with mint leaves, and enjoy this super refreshing drink on a hot afternoon.

Iced coffee pairs so well with citrus fruits and yuzu gives it a unique bitter-sweet flavour. You can also replace with other citron-jam or fruits & zest.
