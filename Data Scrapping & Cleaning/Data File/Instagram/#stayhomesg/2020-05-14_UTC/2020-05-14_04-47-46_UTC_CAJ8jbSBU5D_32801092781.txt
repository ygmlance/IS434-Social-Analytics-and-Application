Circuit breaker Day 38: Old school western food 👍👍 All this for $26, very generous with the portions! Bought this from a random store I saw on the FB Hawkers group, nothing famous. Really enjoyed the pork chop, well seasoned, tender, fresh off the grill & this slight char taste to it 😋 Coleslaw was light & refreshing. Fried chicken can’t beat Uno’s one though.
📍Hock Kee Western (Hougang Ave 5)
