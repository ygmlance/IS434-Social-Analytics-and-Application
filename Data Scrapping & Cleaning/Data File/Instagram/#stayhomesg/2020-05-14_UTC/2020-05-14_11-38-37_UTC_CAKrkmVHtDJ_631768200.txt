Day 38 Circuit breaker dinner.
Is another porridge evening.
Sweet potatoes porridge.  You can see i used organic brown rice & pearls barley,  the water is not cloudy it is very clear.
I purposely scoop dry and took pictures on pic 3 & 4 so you can have a clearer picture of what is organic barley.
Fried a 配菜 and a sunny side up heart shaped egg.又清掉一包鸡蛋，每天开幕新的。😊
Enough for tonight .
多做就要多洗。😁
