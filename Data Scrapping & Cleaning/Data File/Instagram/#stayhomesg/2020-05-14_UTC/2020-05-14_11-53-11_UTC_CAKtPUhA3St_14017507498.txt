[HAI CHI JIA VERMICELLI]
there has been a recent ongoing hype about this instant spicy and sour vermicelli in singapore (not sure about other countries- let me know!), and it is so popular that it is almost always sold out in sheng siong supermarkets! i count myself lucky for having found the last few cups on the shelf on a random weekday afternoon✌️. to save yourself from the hassle of physically checking them out from the stores, you may also shop for them online (e.g. @lazada_sg , @qoo10sg etc)! .

tip: i would recommend you all to add slightly lesser water than their recommended water level for a more intense flavour and extra shiokness, and perhaps some of your favourite  ingredients too. it's up to you, though!

p/s: i also recently learnt of another new product i.e. instant mala oden, which is also fast growing in popularity in singapore! i have yet to try, but you may order them from @snacksdeliverysg and let me know how it tastes!
