Breaking Circuit D38...
Morning walk towards vuurtorentje. Breath in, breath out. Perhaps next time wearing high-heeled sandals for extra stretching. Floating barges... Floatel? Would it feel like a cruise without cruising? Never knew this existed. Never thought of it. Unfolding unconscious living. Looked...but now able to see.
"It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see" by Henry David Thoreau.
