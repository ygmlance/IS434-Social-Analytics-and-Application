From a nice, cool yesterday to a hot, balmy today, changes in temperatures can make us susceptible to colds and flus. 
Black garlic mushroom chicken soup can help boost our immunity. Black garlic is a super food infused with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. This is hubby’s fav. 😄😄 Ingredients: 
1️⃣Black Garlic 
2️⃣Chicken (I used drumsticks)
3️⃣Shitake Mushrooms (can replace with Chinese dried mushrooms too) 
4️⃣Goji Berries 
5️⃣Honey Date
