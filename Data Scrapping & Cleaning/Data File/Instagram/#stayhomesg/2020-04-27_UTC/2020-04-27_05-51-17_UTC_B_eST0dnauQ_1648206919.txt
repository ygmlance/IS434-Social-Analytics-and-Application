For those of you staying at home, well done ! Here’s another two reasons to order in tonight.

Photo 1: Sayur Lodeh
Cabbage, carrots, long beans, beancurd cooked in a slightly pedas coconut curry.

Photo 2: Chicken Curry Kapitan
Aromatic nonya style chicken curry with potatoes.

There’s not much better than a warm curry, on a cold day. These two are just slightly spicy, so it won’t kill your tongue. Just good old comfort food.

Order them on their own, or as part of a set. We have family meals that are perfect for 4 Pax and 6 Pax.

We also feature FREE ISLANDWIDE DELIVERY for orders $50 and above.
