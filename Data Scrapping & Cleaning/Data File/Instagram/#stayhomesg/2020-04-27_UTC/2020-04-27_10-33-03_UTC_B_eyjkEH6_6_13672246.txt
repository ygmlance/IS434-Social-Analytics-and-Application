While mommy is preparing for HBL lesson to conduct before lunchtime, Little A also has HBL with her K1 classmates once a week. Today is her Mandarin class with her K1 classmates and she is listening to her teacherâ€™s instructions before they participate in class activities. Happy to see all her friends once again! ðŸ™‚
