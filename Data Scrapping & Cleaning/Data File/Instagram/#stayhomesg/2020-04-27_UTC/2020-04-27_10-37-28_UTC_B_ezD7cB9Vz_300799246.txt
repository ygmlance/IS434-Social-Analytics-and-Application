Assalammualaikum Dearest Customers,

Thank you so much for your PMs, concerned abt the New Law which was imposed yesterday üòç 
YanTi Really Apologised because still hasn't got the time to reply some of you because we are still doing deliveries, always on the move.

When YanMaL Xprezz 1st Started, our Main Customers are All our Home-Based Online Sellers. We Appreciate your Supports till now, thus we have tried calling Acra & MTI, but cant thru the office. Thus we've emailed them. We hope we can still colaborate with All of You...
Pls wait for us to update once we received reply from the Authority... Ya Allah, sesungguhnye pada Bulan Ramadan ini, Kami sekeluarga kluar mencari rezeki yg Halal, Kami mohon agar dilindungi daripada wabak yg bahaya ini, agar dipermudahkan segala urusan kami & diberkati rezeki kami...aammiinn ya rabbal alamin...
