♡Mee Siam (Dry Version)♡
Love the spicy & sweet flavours in this, although the former stands out more 🤪😋 You can use various toppings, here I used fried firm toufu, tow pok, prawns, sotong & top it off with hard boiled eggs. You can also just add beansprouts, chives & shredded omelet which will still be damn good.

The chilli was done by my friend's mum! 👍🏻I do not know the recipe but roughly should be blending together dried chillies, shallots & garlic.

I only have regular lime with me, it still works very well in giving that tangy kick to the noodles. .

PS: @anythingjamie intro this @pebblysg tongs, so aesthetically to use when serving food.
