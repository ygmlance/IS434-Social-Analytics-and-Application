Made more masks using fabric scraps I have. One of the fabric was part of my Indian dress which I cut shorter. The mask will match my Indian dress perfectly 😄💕🌹🎶. Handmade mask is good as you could choose the design and materials you like. 🥰Have a great week everyone😘 #handmademask #facemaskhomemade #upcyclefabricscraps #upcyclefashion #upcyclefabric #stayhomesg
