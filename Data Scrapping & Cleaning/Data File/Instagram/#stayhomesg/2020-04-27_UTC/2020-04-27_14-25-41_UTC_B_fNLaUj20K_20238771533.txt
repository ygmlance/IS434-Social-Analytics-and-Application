After a week of cooking every single meal, we treated ourselves to @paradisegrpsg’s Beauty in a Pot for dinner! We got the BTIP Set A Meal, which is good for 3-4 pax (free delivery over $50!), plus a half order of sliced beef. The fried beancurd skin that we ordered was outta stock, so it was replaced with beef balls after calling us to let us know. We added the the items on the right from our fridge, to round out the meal. Can’t believe we finished nearly everything (see the last pic for all that was left)!! The delivery came with an extra two containers of the rich collagen broth, which will be dinner for tomorrow night! So worth it!
