In line with the latest updates on circuit breaker measures in SG affecting home businesses, for ALL new orders coming in as of today, we will be mailing them out after 1 June 2020.

Pls order only if you’re okay to wait till then to receive your items. (This does not apply to digital commissions)

For existing orders, we would have emailed you the status of your shipping. Pls contact us via DM or email if you have not heard from us.

Thank you for your support!

Meanwhile, let’s continue to work hard, fellow small biz owners to create and do good! We can get through this together. We’re gonna be okay!
