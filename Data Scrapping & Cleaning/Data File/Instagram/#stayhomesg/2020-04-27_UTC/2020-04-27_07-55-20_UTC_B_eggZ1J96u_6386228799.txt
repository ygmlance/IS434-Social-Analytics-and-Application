Buddha bowls are easier than you think. Choose your favourite veggies and add either rice, noodles or quinoa as your base. This time I chose: edamame, shredded carrots, nori seaweed, pickled red cabbage, sunflower seeds and of course kimchi! Dress it with your favourite dressing, mine is yuzu with sesame oil.
