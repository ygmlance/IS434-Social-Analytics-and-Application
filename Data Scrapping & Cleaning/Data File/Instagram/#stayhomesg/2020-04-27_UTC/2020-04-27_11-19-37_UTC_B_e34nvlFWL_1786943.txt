I have been craving for spicy/vinegarish noodles! Since my area doesn't have anything similar to this, I decided to make it myself! ⁣
⁣
Decided to make a XO minced meat + mushroom to go along with the noodles. I used handmade noodles (which I didn't make myself 😅) aka ban mian. ⁣
⁣
Used @noobcook recipe for the XO meat sauce: you can search xo sauce noodle on google and it should appear! ⁣
⁣
Usually you can just end with mixing the XO meat with noodles, but I added rice vinegar (black kind) with chilli (those with chilli oil, like laoganma!) to my noodles. ⁣
⁣
Mix everything together and you have a super delicious meal! Super easy to make as well.
