Forgot about #climatechange?

Directed by Jeff Gibbs and produced by @MichaelFMoore, 'Planet of the Humans' is a stark reminder that WE HUMANS are the No. 1 threat to ourselves and 🌏. I watched this eco-docu on @YouTube (available till 20 May) in 1 sitting in the wee hours of this morning; I usually watch something much shorter than this in parts, so it was compelling.

My 2 cents: while most of us 'laypeople' are unable to verify published data about climate impact and supposed machinations behind 'collective environmentalism', we all—at the very least—must persist with individual action.

Additional comment: environmentalists AND POLICYMAKERS can take a harder look at overproduction, which leads to filled shelves and low prices that in turn induces consumer demand. COVID-19 is having a dampening effect on it, but production will ramp up in due time to 'save the economy'... 😫

We know what to do in order to #StaySafe and it's crucial that we keep going; we likewise ought to know what we personally can (and can't) do for the benefit of Earth as well as ourselves, and keep at it! Perhaps climate change can do with a #CircuitBreaker too.

P.S. Associated Press calls PotH a 'piercing examination'. 💘
