Wanted to make spicy tuna mayo and saba teriyaki sushi rolls... but my knives were not sharp enough to cut the rolls and it turned out so ugly! ðŸ˜­ In the end, I made sushi out of the cute animal moulds (Guess u could tell which are the ones with spicy tuna mayo lol). Rest of the rice? Roll them into balls instead. ðŸ˜…#stayhomesg #diy #sushi #epicfail
