How is working from home with kids like? I’m largely jobless with occasional assignments that I do on freelance. I’m by name a stay home Mum, so maybe staying home with kids is quite my forte. In time like this, I count my man lucky that I can fend the kids away while he works from home. Mostly in peace.

I can’t speak the same perspectives of a working mum, but I feel the challenges of juggling so many hats. And honestly, more spare time for your child probably involves a lot more screen time. I use this trump card as a last resort.

Apart from having a routine, here are some ideas to keep your child peeled from you:
1. Audio books (stories.audible.com)
2. Open ended toys (LEGO, building blocks, magnet tiles, play dough)
3. Papers, pencil, colour pencils
4. Puzzles
5. A huge cardboard box for drawing. Anything. 
6. Handy snacks. Allow your child to reach for healthy snacks/fruits on his own.
7. Give tasks. Maybe cooking a meal with his kitchen toys, or form shapes/letters with his toys.

And remember too, to rotate the toys every few days so it appears as a refreshing play to your child. Feel free to pile on more ideas for our hardworking mamas! Meanwhile, let’s live with the mess. Don’t be too hard on ourselves because clearly, there’s no perfect mum.
