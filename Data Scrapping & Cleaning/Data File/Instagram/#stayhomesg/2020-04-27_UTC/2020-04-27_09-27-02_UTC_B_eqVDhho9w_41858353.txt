⁣A much simpler recipe today- Gambas al ajillo, with whatever I could find in the house.⠀
⠀
⠀
The base of this is basically just olive oil(I toast the shells and add the prawn miso back in to flavor the oil), garlic, shrimp, and some form of chilli powder(I used snipped up dried chillis and paprika powder), acidity in the form of lemon juice or sherry vinegar can be added if you'd like. ⠀

Takes like 10 minutes to make and is great over rice as well, super easy 😌
