We are into our 4th week of Circuit Breaker to deal with the Covid-19 virus. How are you coping? Are you stressed, worried and anxious?

It is normal to experience stress, anxiety and even mild depression from being cooped up at home. Take a moment to breathe deeply, know that whatever you do, you are already doing the best that you can. 
If you need further support, please do feel free to email us at edmund@healingspace.sg or call us at 87519634

Let's get through this together!
