“Hope does not disappoint” 🌊 ～ “And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.” ~ Rom 5:3-5
.
Even in the midst of the storm, 
You can still experience a miracle. 
Don’t lose heart for hope and grace is for you. 💙
