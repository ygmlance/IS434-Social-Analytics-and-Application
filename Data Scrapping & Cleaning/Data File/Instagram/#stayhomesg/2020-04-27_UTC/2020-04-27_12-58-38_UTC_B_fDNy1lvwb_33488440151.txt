Do you catch yourself frequently breaking out into song? Love to sing in the shower? Then be part of Sing For Singapore today and stand a chance to win $1,000 cash! - Record a short video (60 seconds max) of you singing. Donâ€™t forget to say hello!
- Your chosen song must be in English and should not contain any vulgarities. If it's good enough for radio, it's good enough for us!
- Post the video on your own page and give us a shoutout! If we love what we hear we'll share it on our page!
- Likes play a part too so make sure you get your family and friends to like and share your video!

Group acts are more than welcome. All groups should only consist of people living in the same household. There are no age limits so anyone, old and young, can participate too!
