And just like that, my firstborn is SEVEN!

He’s a big boy now! A sweet boy who loves to write “thank you” letters to mommy when mommy does something for him. “Thank you mommy for making this fun.., Thank you mommy for giving me this..., Thank you mommy for bringing me to...., Thank you mommy for everything...”. He’s my firstborn who is always full of gratitude and I’m really grateful for having him in my life. A big brother who takes care his baby sister so well. I can trust him when it comes to looking after the baby when mommy is busy. He’s also the one who comes to my room every morning because he wants to cuddle his baby sister and carry her. A lovely brother to his 2 younger sisters ❤️

Happy 7th birthday to my firstborn, my oldest child, my only boy and my first love! ❤️ I hope Primary One will be a great journey for you this year! Thank you for teaching me how to be a mama!

Due to circuit breaker measures in Singapore, unfortunately it is really hard to order a birthday cake. Cake shops are closed during circuit breaker (semi lockdown) until 1 June and online shops & delivery slots are always full. So I decided to make his birthday cake myself. He requested 🌈 layered agar-agar jelly cake with dinosaur theme, so I spent hours preparing his dino props, all hand drawn/coloured by myself and I’m glad that he was one very happy birthday boy despite staying home all the time and no guests attending his party! This little home party meant a lot to him in this current situation! It cheered him & his 2 sisters so much and us too! The rainbow agar-agar jelly cake was handmade and it took me 3.5 hours to complete 12 layers of rainbow colours. This is how much I love my child 🤣❤️ I will update the recipe this week! Absolutely easy and simple but obviously very tedious and time consuming! 😂
