Due for 15mo vaccine ðŸ’‰, where mummy keep forgetting the appointment. Finally went ahead on last thurs, praying that fever wonâ€™t come this weekend. ðŸ¥º Carried him since we left home, and nope! Not going to let you walk nor touch anything!! Protective mummy is here! But babywear the almost 12kg big baby is not easy!

Workout for the day!
