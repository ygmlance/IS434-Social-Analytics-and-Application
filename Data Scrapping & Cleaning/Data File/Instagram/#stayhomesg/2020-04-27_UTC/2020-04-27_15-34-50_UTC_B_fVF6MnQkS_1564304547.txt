Thank you @yi_yen_s for sharing this photo with us! 😊 Makes our heart flutter to see such a blissful face, everything makes sense for us when you are happy too! 😍 Yi-Yen chose our FM Studio Dance Mat 3.5mm in light grey, joined 2 dance mats of 2x3m to create such a large space for her daughter to #dance! This is a mother’s love, never forgotten, forever felt ❤️ No matter big or small dance mat, or no dance mat, all #Mummies are the best! So privileged to meet parents of #dancers doing what we do 😌 Our online orders are still open, local deliveries for #DanceMats and #Barre are FREE and international courier is calculated at checkout. Last 2 lightly used dance mats left! We wish everyone a safe week, trust that we are doing our best to push for your orders to be delivered ASAP. @freemovementsg cares! 💕 #DanceStudio #DanceSg #HappyDays #freemovementsg #dancersofinstagram #dancelife #HomeDanceStudio #dancelove #SGUnited #StayHomeSg #FreeMovementStudio
