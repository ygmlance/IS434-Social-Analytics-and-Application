😃 Exercise has great benefits for mental health.  It releases endorphins that make us happy 😃 .

Commencement of another week once again and it’s the third week since we commenced our Circuit Breaker.  How is it going for you?  Used to it or feeling restless? .

For me, I am getting used to it.  Happier that I get to spend more time at home, reading, exercising, doing some craft work but busier as I need to cook and clean the house more often.  Missed the time for coffee/meals with friends and shopping... .Dilemma.... and lost track on the dates too...🤣😂

Workout continues on a windy Monday morning on day  1️⃣1️⃣8️⃣. ✅ 10 minutes arm & shoulder ✅ 10 minutes abs
✅ 10 minutes thighs ✅ 30 minutes full body 👍🏻 completed another 60 minutes for the day... feel so good and happy that my body is getting stronger...
