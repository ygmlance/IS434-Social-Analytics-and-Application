I love seeing my kids cook. Surprisingly, Carter (the jock) is much more interested in cooking than Hunter is!

We made Chicken Cordon Bleu together, which turned out beautifully crispy in the oven (healthier than frying it in oil). Served with a drizzle of my own homemade Dijon herbed cream sauce!ðŸ¤—
