What we‚Äôve been feeding for our last week! *PART II

1. #BraisedPork #LorBak #Âç§ËÇâ 
It‚Äôs like Curry; Perfect along with all carbs! Name it! Rice, Porridge, Buns

2. Trio Egg Spinach
I‚Äôm an Egg Lover. Salted Egg, Century Egg. Egggggggs ü•ö
& this is definitely In My Comfort Food list.

3. Steam Minced Pork & Salted Egg
Here, I‚Äôve got my braised Shrooms left from my braised pork, & I laid it at the bottom to steam along w the meat. Yet, I‚Äôd prefer shrooms minced and chopped and mixed it in the meat for steaming!

4. Basil Minced Pork Rice with Egg
Our Favourite Thai Dish!

5. Sausage Spaghetti (tomato base)
We are not cream based lovers. It gets jelak. So mostly, we do tomato based pasta, & this is one recipe for quick fix on lazy days.

6. Curry Chilli Fries
I came across a recipe online;
Oven baked curry powdered fries and I thought I‚Äôd add Chilli and Garlic too.
& Voila! It‚Äôs addictive this thing. & look forward week after week for new menu ideas.
