Another #CHERYLCERTIFIED for your next #fooddelivery is @saltedandhung!! Our favourite is the Mac & Cheese 🧀, Smoked Chicken 🍗 (omg soooo frickin’ good) and this Wagyu Pastrami Sandwich 🥪 (those pickles are something else with hints of cloves & cinnamon)! Check out https://saltedhung.oddle.me/en_SG/ for the full spread and to check out their #mothersday special!!! You won’t regret it!! It’s our fave restaurant helmed by the super talented @chef.drew.nocente!! 👨🏻‍🍳 What did you have for #dinner tonight? .
