This ðŸ§€ Baked Milo CheeseCake nearly didnâ€™t happened.. because I failed at making a Milo Mille Crepe Cake, and it was too late to start all over.. (was in the kitchen the whole day.. too tired ðŸ’¤) - wanted to call it quits, but decided to use the Milo and make something completely different instead.

Felt a little guilty to tell @jiajianai that there wonâ€™t be any cake, sooo taaadaaaaâœ¨ turned out better than expected even though I didnâ€™t have enough cream cheese.. crust & cheese ratio was perfect hehe.

So..if youâ€™re a personal friend and a fan of thrill & surprises.. with the  possibility of not getting a cake LOL, lemme know next time hehe.
