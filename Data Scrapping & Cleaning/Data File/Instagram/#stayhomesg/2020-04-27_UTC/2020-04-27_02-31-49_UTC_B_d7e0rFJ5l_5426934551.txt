A lovely freshly baked sourdough loaf, ready for breakfast. 
This was a last-minute bake, I usually proof my loaves overnight, but in order to get this on the table for breakfast, I decided to bake it in a loaf pan instead. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it turned out, but I’ll have to work on getting that crust much thinner and crisper next time ☺️ Any tips from fellow bread bakers? 😅
