Day 21 of circuit breaker, we did planting today. I gave Leodys some green beans and ask him to plant it on the cotton pad. He called the green beans “ball ball”. This strengthens his pincer skill by picking small objects. I also told him that everyday he needed to water a bit of water to make it grow, but this part he seemed lost, not listening. But I will make him do it tomorrow. Pardon his short hair, is done by this inexperienced mummy. I am now feeling quite depressed over it. Can’t wait for circuit breaker to end and I bring him to cut. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #hbl #homebasedlearning #homebasedactivities #planting #platingseeds #greenbeans #pincergrasp #pincergrasppractice #wfh #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #hshmonz
