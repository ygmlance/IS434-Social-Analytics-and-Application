🍔Everyday is a good day. 🍔 Positive quote does make a difference to our mindset!
Had a disappointing start to the day when my Burger King delivery did not arrive despite it reflecting as delivered on the app. So we waited for an hour before we gave up. Luckily I still have my many pieces of Madeleines on the table. 🤣 So it’s back to Madeleines breakfast again - plated on Hello Kitty Bowl, paired with milo served in Noritake mug from a dear friend. Then I saw today’s quote and I saw the “Happy Day” label popping out from the ornament plant. And I’m 😊 again. Still, it’s a blessing to be able to stay safe and healthy, with or without Burger King. I guess next time I should just walk 20 minutes to the nearest Burger King outlet. I miss Macdonalds! 😅
