Blissful Monday with these spring blooms to brighten up the last week of April! Supposed to be packing for our much-awaited French getaway, but plans had to change due to Covid. Thanks @theenchantedtreesg for this beautiful arrangement to keep me going! #springathomeðŸŒ· #prettyblooms #theenchantedtreesg #preservedflowers #stayhomesg #simplejoys
