Thank you for all your continued support!

We will be closing our store until 1 June 2020. If you do decide to place an order with us, we will only be able to fulfil the order after 1 June so that our delivery heroes can focus on delivering essentials.

Big shoutout to everyone who is out and about working hard to keep things running in these times. Stay safe and well!

If you are a healthcare professional or work in delivery/courier services (in Singapore only) and are keen on any of our products, please drop us a DM. We would like to express our gratitude for your contributions in our own mylittlegreendot way.
