During this Circuit Breaker(CB) period, we will be giving out skincare tips every week to help our ladies to maintain.

Tip #1A: Always wash your face after you bathe.

People might be wondering, duh, how is this even a tip. As much as we recommend people to wash face with cool tap water, there are people who shower and wash their face at the same time with warm water. ⭐️Procedures do matter.

There are people who insist in bathing with lukewarm water, especially during rainy days, which is fine. 👉🏻Take note: After you finish bathing in lukewarm/warm water, please switch to cool tap water when you wash your face.
👉🏻recommend to wash your face after your shower, to wash off residues of hair conditional and hair leave-ons( which might cause negative reactions on your facial skin) ⭐️Its the small habits that counts
