Day 93 of Isolating. You may notice that I have an extra set of feet here. Thatâ€™s because my little one is glued to my side from 2am-7:30pm everyday. Are you isolating alone or covered in kids or somewhere in between? I wonder what the correlation between these groups and snacks vs alcohol intake is. .
