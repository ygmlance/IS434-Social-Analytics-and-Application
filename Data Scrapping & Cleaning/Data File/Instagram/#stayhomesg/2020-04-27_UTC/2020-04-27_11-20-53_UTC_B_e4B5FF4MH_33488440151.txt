Hello from Sing For Singapore! 
We're a virtual charity talent show focusing on singing. And we want you! We aim to be a platform that connect all residents of SG and also one that allows us to be there for our fellow man. This online competition will last one month and will end on the 27th of May. 
That means we'll be around to entertain you until the end (almost) of the Circuit Breaker. Our goal is to drive $50,000 in donations for The Food Bank Singapore. 
How? Through the power of music (and your kind contributions) of course! Throughout this entire month, you can help out by donating to the cause while being entertained, or even sign up for your shot at stardom. 
Sign up details in the next post!
