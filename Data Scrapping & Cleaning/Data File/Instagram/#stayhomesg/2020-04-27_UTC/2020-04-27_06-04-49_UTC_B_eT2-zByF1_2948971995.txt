[CEASING OPERATIONS TEMPORARILY]
.
Hello everyone! ü§ç We‚Äôre still receiving orders for our tarts via emails and direct messages. There are also queries for Mother‚Äôs Day dessert packs, which we‚Äôve already had lined up. Alas, the latest regulation was officially put in place. As Ola Lola is a home-based business, we have to temporarily cease operations. So we won‚Äôt be able to commit to any orders. Zilch. Nada.
.
But let‚Äôs all practice patience and kindness towards one and all, shall we? Thank you again for all the messages of love and well-wishes. We‚Äôll hang in there. You will too. Stay home, stay safe! Anyway, you still can order tarts after 1 June okay? :)
