One of the things I miss during this whole covid-19 situation? Travelling. Once this is all over, I'm definitely heading overseas for a bit. I had plans to go to New Zealand this year but that all went up in smoke and my plane tickets became credits. ðŸ˜­

How about you guys? What are your plans after this pandemic?
