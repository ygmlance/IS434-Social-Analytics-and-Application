SUN PROTECTION / SLEEPING MASK

On the last instalment of our #BACKTOBASICS series, Sunscreen is a must, rain or shine! The best and easiest way to protect your skin from ageing is to wear sunscreen daily. 
Check that your sunscreen protects against UVA and UVB rays! UVA rays penetrate the deeper layers of your skin and cause long term damage such wrinkles and saggy skin. UVB rays harm the surface of your skin, causing sunburn, pigmentation, freckles/moles, sun spots and redness.

Sleeping masks are great on those nights you feel like your skin needs an extra boost of moisture and protection. Apply on top of your moisturiser to reinforce the moisture barrier and further prevent moisture loss from occurring overnight.

There are some moisturisers which also can act as a sleeping mask (vice versa). Simply apply a thicker layer of moisturiser to use it as a sleeping mask (or thinner layer of sleeping mask to use as a moisturiser)! If you are in need of guidance for your skin issue during this difficult time, interact with us on our Telegram, and get your answers on anything under the sun at our space!
