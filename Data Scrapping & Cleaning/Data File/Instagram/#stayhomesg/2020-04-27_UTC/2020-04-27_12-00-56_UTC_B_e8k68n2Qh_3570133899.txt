Singapore, we’ve got your back (bag) 🎒⁠
⁠
When BOW started back in 2016, there was an outpour of love from the community. We got by with models we approached on the streets, random pop-ups that we were invited to (more like self-invited 😝) and lastly, shout-outs + collaborations with other local brands.⁠
⁠
With the recent COVID-19 situation affecting our whole community, it’s time for us to do our part. 🤝⁠
⁠
We’ve decided to donate 10% of sales proceeds from any #BOWCares Kit / Family Bundles to the Migrant Workers' Assistance Fund, a non-profit fund that provides food, accommodation and daily necessities help to the migrant workers in Singapore. So far, we’ve raised close to $1000 to help these migrant workers! ❤️⁠
⁠
This month, we’re also banding together with some of our favourite local brands who can help your extended #CB situation a lil’ easier. Check out our first brand collab tomorrow, 28 April at 7PM SGT. Hint – are you GAME for it? 😉 ⁠
⁠
Thanks for helping us keep the lights on. Join in by tagging one local brand you think deserves some love below 👇⁠
