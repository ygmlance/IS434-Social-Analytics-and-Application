Use this easy trick if you donâ€™t fancy your home lighting. Off all light to get a pitch black (if you have natural lighting aka window in the room, do it in evening time, I did mine at 8pm). Be creative and create any shape for your lighting effect, circle, star, triangle, you name it! If youâ€™re not feeling crafty, just use toilet paper roll for the circle effect, it will do the magic too ðŸ¤“ *I used circle for my profile pic and set it to B&W tone
