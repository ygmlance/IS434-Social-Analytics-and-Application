Circuit breaker Day 21: Kolo mee for $4 👍 Drove to Bedok to dabao kolo mee today. Chose the bigger $4 portion (instead of $3.50), very value for money, couldn’t finish 😅 On hindsight should have gone without chilli (don’t usually eat my kolo mee with chilli). Not the most authentic Sarawak kolo mee, noodles were a tad thicker & not as springy; but still a good meal overall ☺️
📍 59 New Upper Changi Road (some small kolo mee store I saw being recommended on the Hawkers FB group)
