Featuring the newest addition to our stay home Supa family! * Supa Uni Sunrise Package *

Tonnes of Uni with tonnes of Ikura !!!
Why Sunrise you ask? The sun symbolizes many things, for one it represents Japan, the land of the rising sun! It is Orange and round like ikura! It looks like a sea urchin! And most of all, it warms our hearts! 
We hope this Uni and Ikura Sunrise package will warm everyones hearts during this period.
