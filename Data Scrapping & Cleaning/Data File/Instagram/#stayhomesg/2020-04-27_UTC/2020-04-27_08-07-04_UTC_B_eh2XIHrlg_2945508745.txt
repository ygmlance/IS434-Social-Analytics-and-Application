@swishswimming is a familiar name for those who have kids who are learning to swim. They teach children aged 4 months and above, and Kristen Romain is the lady who heads this team up!

The operate out of the Dempsey cluster and have a heated indoor and outdoor salt-chlorinated pool, and a relaxing area for parents to observe the lesson. .

Kristen started her career as a lawyer, worked in media much of her corporate life before pivoting into a career that follows her passion. We love that she wants to teach children to swim for pure joy - rather than just survival. So they each enjoy the process as they pick up the important survival skill. .

Her song is this whimsical, relaxing one called 'Swell Window' by Zee Avi from the Album Ghostbird. Hear the sound of the ocean and feel the breeze in your face as you listen to it. Lovely üß°
