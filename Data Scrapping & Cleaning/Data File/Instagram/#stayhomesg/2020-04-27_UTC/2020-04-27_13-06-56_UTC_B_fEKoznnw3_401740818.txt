This #circuitbreaker, there are two things I wanted to do. This is the first: my Wireless Charging Keyboard Hack. https://youtu.be/NWyG5zHr_60 (link in bio)

The toll of telecommuting for 5 weeks is starting to affect me, and the others around me. We get angrier at situations and people more easily, it's easier to get demoralized about things, communications with colleagues sometimes just isn't as clear or as smooth. The lines between work and life at home blurs as you sometimes find yourself working late into the night or over weekends.

I also realize that it's more than just those problems - it has also been a prolonged period since any of us took leave for a proper break with all travel plans suspended.

Sometimes it's good to take a break to do something new at home, or something that breaks away from this daily routine. This YouTube video will be the first of many passion projects I undertake.

This is a video of one of many workspace hacks - this time, I installed 2 Qi wireless chargers invisibly into my desk for my phone, and most importantly, my wireless RGB keyboard.

Do watch it and let me know what you think!

Special thanks to @liyun1706 for the potato icon for my banner!
