Be inspired to do something different. ❤️
-
We are into Week 4 of the Circuit Breaker in Singapore. Been staying home and cooking for my family of 5. Trying out new recipes, cooking up a storm of love for the family. 🥰

I actually surprised myself and the family with my new found “talent” in cooking haahaa. And I am improving by the leap (exclaims the husband! 😄) as I spend more time inside the kitchen. Such a big difference from where I was, 4 weeks ago. And my love for cooking is increasing, by the leap too.

What I have cooked for the past 2 days and yes, everything is vegan. 😊
• Lor Bak (Teochew braised meat)
• Chicken rice
• Stir-fried non spicy mala
• Veggie Yaki Udon
• Veggie Hokkien mee

Looking forward to more inspirations in vegan cooking.💗
