One of our favourite things to do together at home is art. Sometimes, the activity is unstructured, other times, my little girl inspires me with her imagination.
.
🌿Craft time is when I use presence to convey my appreciation of her effort. My little girl is free to express herself through art; and when she’s immersed in concentration, I enjoy our time through silent observation and few interruptions.
.
🌿I hope, through art, she would find her own place; discover her strengths; experience living in the moment; and learn that we can create happiness without consumption - that joy can be self-created, that joy is within us.

This picture captures a moment several weeks back, after we returned home from nature play.

Mama, let’s dance in the garden with these dresses” - and that comment was what inspired me to sketch this piece.
.
🌿I actually enjoyed the process of this craft more than the product, those nimble hands and wonderful scissors skills were some discoveries I made of my little girl that afternoon.
