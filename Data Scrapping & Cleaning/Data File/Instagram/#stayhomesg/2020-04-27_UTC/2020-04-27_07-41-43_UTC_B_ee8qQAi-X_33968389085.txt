#leonie hill residences is it still possible to find any unit in this premium area under $2000? Recent transaction for this condominium doesn’t suggest so 😩 
Pros and cons for this area/ condo:
✅ high rise ✅relatively new since built in 2005
✅freehold ❌high entry $psf price ❌irregular shaped balcony 😝  #apartmenttherapy  #covidtimes #stayhomesg #stayhomestaysafe #orchardroad #wfh #onebedroom #expatsg #sgexpat #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #sgproperty #district9 #district10 #district11 #covid
