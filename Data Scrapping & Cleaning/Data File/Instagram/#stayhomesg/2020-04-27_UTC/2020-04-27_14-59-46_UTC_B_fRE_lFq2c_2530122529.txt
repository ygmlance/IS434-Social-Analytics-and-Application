New recipe 21— Orange chicken 🍗 
I’m completely happy with the way I made this one. When my hubby asked me to try this one I was like yeah ok let’s do this . It is something we never tasted before . On te whole Turned out to be a new experience!!! This is boneless chicken fried and tossed in a sauce made mainly with orange juice 🍊🍊🍊 . Finally garnished with orange zest... #foodie #newrecipes #cookinglove #circuitbreaker #stayhomesg
