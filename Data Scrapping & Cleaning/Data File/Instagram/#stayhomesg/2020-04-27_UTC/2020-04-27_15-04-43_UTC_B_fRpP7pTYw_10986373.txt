Instead of encountering adverse conditions in the jungle, trainees say air-conditioning and home-cooked meals aren’t detracting from the program’s rigorous demands, according to personal accounts shared today by the Defense Ministry.
⠀
“This is not a break for us to slack off; we still have our responsibilities as soldiers,” Ferguson Chiew told the Defense Ministry outlet Pioneer in an interview published today.
⠀
“Even though we cannot carry out practical training now, learning the theory helps to prepare us so that we can be ready when BMT resumes,” Emir Ilyas bin Elham, another conscript, chimed in, referring to Singapore Basic Military Training.
⠀
Recruits are now learning through a home-based program following the suspension of military training last month in accordance with measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. The suspension affected more than 3,000 new recruits and is currently set to expire May 4.
⠀
Emir and Chiew reportedly are unfazed by the changes and remained committed to completing their training.
⠀
A significant part of the training consists of vigorous physical exercise to prepare them for an annual fitness test called the Individual Physical Proficiency Test.
⠀
Recruits at home are being given instructional materials and fitness videos.
⠀
“Back in camp, we had a mealtime regime where, before going for lunch or dinner, we would have to do static exercises like push-ups, sit-ups and squats. I do this at home too, including before breakfast. It just takes me half an hour. Every night, I go for a run too,” Emir said.
