#stayhome Sweet and Savoury Creations.
.
We attempted to make a #spanakopita to save our very sad looking spinach leeks spring onion lettuce and whatever leftover scraggly vegetables that was in the fridge and we are so glad we did.
.
Not only did we prevent a big waste of ingredients, we made a healthy-ish meal (letâ€™s not count the layers of olive oil in between filo pastry sheets) and we had leftover filo to treat ourselves to a sweetie desert roll filled with #marmalade and #pistachio ...
.
It was yum... so yum we forgot to take a shot of the insides of the sweet roll ... oh well
