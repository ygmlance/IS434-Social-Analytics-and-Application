YES, LOOK NO FURTHER.
I WAS THAT NOISY NEIGHBOUR OF YOURS THAT WAS SCREAMING THIS SONG.

When you are having a headache to do a Mandarin or English cover, you cut the headache, be greedy and do both.

Had the honour to perform this iconic song for a large-scaled National Day performance last year and it brings back so many memories.

Let's sing this together! Lai lai.
View the uninterrupted version on my Facebook @ Kaitlyn KTL or Kaitlyn Lin.

P/S: On second thought, maybe I shall save the full version for National Day hor. If not I have nothing to show.
