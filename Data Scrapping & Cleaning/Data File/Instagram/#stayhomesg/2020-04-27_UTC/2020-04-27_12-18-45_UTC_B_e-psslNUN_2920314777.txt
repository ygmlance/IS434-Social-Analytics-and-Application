#stayhomesg:  Egg, Tofu and Potatoes Mayo Sandwiches...
Egg Mayo Sandwiches is nice. To reduce consuming too much egg, I mixed hard boil egg with hard boil potatoes and tofu scramble (with turmeric) with mayo/vegan mayo. Season with salt, pepper and mixed well for the filling.

To save time, if I am making Chinese Soup, I'll cook the potatoes together. Remove them when soft (keep aside for potatoes salad or other dishes)

Tofu scramble is Vegan Scramble Egg dish, easy to make, crushed a firm tofu, season with salt, pepper, oil/fragrant oil and pan fried.
