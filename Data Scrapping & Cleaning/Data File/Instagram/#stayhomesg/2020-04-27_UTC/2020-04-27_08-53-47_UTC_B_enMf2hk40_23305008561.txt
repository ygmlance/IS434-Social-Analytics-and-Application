Magical moments occur when you get to see the animals out of photographic context. Sometimes it happens when you see them interact and behave more than just simple animals.

In view of #circuitbreakerapril , i've decided to share some photos to help get through these trying times. In each post, ill be sharing a favourite photo of a bird shot in #singapore and an interesting factoid i've observed.
