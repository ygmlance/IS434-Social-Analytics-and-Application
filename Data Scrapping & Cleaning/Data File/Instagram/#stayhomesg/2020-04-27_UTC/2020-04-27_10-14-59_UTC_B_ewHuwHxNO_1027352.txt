I canâ€™t stress how amazing this deal from @thegyubar.sgâ€™s Takeaway Menu is.
Specially priced for a limited time, the Sukiyaki OR Shabu Shabu Set Meal for 2 pax are going for a serious song. 
If you choose the Japanese Miyazaki Wagyu, itâ€™s $158 (usual price: $198) and includes 6 huge slices of the Miyazaki Sirloin, Dashi and Sukiyaki sauce to cook in (these are sealed in bags), a massive serving of mixed vegetables (thereâ€™s Japanese leeks, corn, carrots and more), shiitake and enoki mushrooms, tofu, two Japanese eggs (youâ€™re suppose to break them before dipping in the beef but I was too excited and missed that step ðŸ˜…), konjac noodles and two bowls of Hokkaido rice.
If you choose #HokkaidoPork instead of #MiyazakiWagyu beef, itâ€™s $88 for the Set for 2 pax (usual price: $128). I can vouch that this is an indulgence worth every cent as the ingredients (especially the Wagyu beef) are of superb quality. 
At the moment, orders are taken via calling #thegyubarsg directly at:
9150 3164.

They do have many other food and drink items (sake and wines) on their Takeaway Menu which you can check out as well. In addition, you will also receive a 10% rebate voucher.
