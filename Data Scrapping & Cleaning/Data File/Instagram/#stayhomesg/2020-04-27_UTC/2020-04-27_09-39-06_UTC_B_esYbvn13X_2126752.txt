Last night’s dinner was mouth-watering! @kelsayshohoho & I ordered the Wagyu Double Patty Burger & Wagyu Double Patty & Sunny Side Up Rice Bowl. The highlight was definitely the Wagyu patty! The Wagyu patty was succulent and grilled to perfection! We regret not adding a 3rd patty as it was soooo good! A pity that we don’t take cheese but we’re sure the taste/looks would be more delicious/appealing to all you cheese-lovers out there! You just really have to try this out for yourselves! Swipe to check out the menu and price list. Thank you @pudgysgrill for filling our tummies and putting a big smile to our hearts!
