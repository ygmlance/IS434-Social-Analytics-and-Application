Sunday lunch be like; enjoying Japanese cuisine from @keikaisendon.sg, delivered straight to our home by @foodpandasg! Our appetites were further stimulated just by looking at the food presentation!

My pick for main dish is Saba Teriyaki Don🐟, dedoned, and grilled to perfection. Together with Tobiko Onsen Egg & Miso soup 🍲as a set! I must say the crunchy fish roes complemented the egg really well.

Husband tried out the Tori Teriyaki Don and he definitely enjoyed munching on the succulent juicy chicken🐓, just as the 4 spicy chicken drumlets!

We ended our delightful meal 🍽 with a refreshing Qoo Fuji Apple 🍹drink!
