Circuit breaker day 21: Chicken abalone congee for lunch. 👩‍🍳 Slow-cooked with chicken and dried scallop broth, with the juice from the canned abalone. It was flavorful on its own and just needed an extra dash of pepper and sesame oil, with some crispy youtiao 🥰

Have a great week ahead, all! Stay cool! 😉
