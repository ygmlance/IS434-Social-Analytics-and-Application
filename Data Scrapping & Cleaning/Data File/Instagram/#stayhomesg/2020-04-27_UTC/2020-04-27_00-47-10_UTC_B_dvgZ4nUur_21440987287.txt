❗️IMPORTANT MESSAGE⁠❗️⁠⠀
.⁠
If you haven't heard, it's been a chaotic Sunday for many online businesses after the more restrictive measures were imposed on all non-essential home based businesses, 🚫prohibiting deliveries during the #circuitbreaker.⁠
.⁠
In line with these enhanced measures to fight COVID19 #sgunited, we are suspending all our deliveries with immediate effect until the restrictions are lifted.⁠
.⁠
You will still be able to order online 🛒if you'd like to secure the @mynakedbar soaps  you want and are OK to receive the soaps after the lifting of restrictions. As we are unable to make new soaps this period, once the current stocks deplete, we will replenish new stock earliest one month after the #circuit breakers are lifted.
.⁠
We apologise for any inconvenience but trust that you understand. For participants of our recent giveaway, your discount code will be extended to June 1.⁠
.⁠
Many of the home based F&B businesses are badly affected due to perishables they hold and orders they have already accepted. We hope something works out for them. 🙏⁠
.⁠
Parents, educators, it's the last week of HBL before the mid-year holidays!!! Hopefully that'll bring some respite esp for parents who WFH at the same time. #stayhomesg⁠
.⁠
Despite the inconveniences and challenges we all face this period, let's start our day with a smile 🌻and do our part to help contain the COVID spread so the measures can be lifted sooner than later. 🙏⁠
