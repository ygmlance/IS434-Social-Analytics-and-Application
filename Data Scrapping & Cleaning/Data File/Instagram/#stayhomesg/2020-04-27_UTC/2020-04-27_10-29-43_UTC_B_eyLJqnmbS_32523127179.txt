Sourdough Pizzas 🍕
.
🍴Overall ease: 3/10
.
🛒Ingredients: sourdough, tomato pizza sauce, mozzarella, and other ingredients to your fancy (some that we used were: chorizo, fior de latte, mushrooms, egg, basil, curry leaf pesto)
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: form the dough and allow it to rest overnight. Make the pizza sauce by boiling down canned tomatoes spiced with dried herbs and garlic. Assemble the pizza to your fancy! Sear each pizza on a cast iron, before finishing it in the oven
.
😋Taste: 8/10. Never made pizzas in our life, and we only have a microwave-cum-oven that can only go as high as 220 degrees. Still, we made do, first by cooking in in a cast iron for the crispy base, before finishing it in the oven. There were mistakes along the way - burnt crust, under baked dough, lack of seasoning - but we were immensely proud of this first pizza attempt! The dough was superb; chewy with a nice crunch, just as sourdough crust should be. Ingredients wise, our favourites were definitely the chorizo-tomato-mozzarella pizza, and the curry leaf pesto-garlic-shrimp pizza. The former was a timeless classic; the latter was unique!
