Look what just arrived! I’ve been trying to reduce plastics in our wrapping and I’m excited to switch to @noissueco eco-friendly tissue paper which used soy-based ink, a sustainable alternative to tradition petroleum-based ink. A huge thanks to @thepatternholic for designing the lovely pattern for me! And I LOVE THIS DUSKY MINT GREEN! 
I decided not to put my shop name or logo on the tissue paper, so that you guys can re-use it for wrapping of gifts or even upcycling a random box! ♻️ • 
Having said that, I’m sorry to announce that we will be mailing your orders after the #circuitbreaker is lifted, but do stick around as I have some surprises for you guys 😉Take care everyone! ❤️
