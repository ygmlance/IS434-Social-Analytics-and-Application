A personal project of Masked Bike Portraits using the Fujifilm GFX50s Medium Format based on the current covid19 pandemic happening in Singapore. As long as we keep ourselves masked up when we are out for essential errands and stay at home as much as we can, we can overcome this crisis. Stay safe and to all riders out there, ill see you all on the streets! ðŸ“·: Fujifilm GFX 50s + GF 32-64mm f/4 R LM WR Lens
ðŸ’¡: Broncolor Siros L 800 + Broncolor 30 x 120 stripbox
