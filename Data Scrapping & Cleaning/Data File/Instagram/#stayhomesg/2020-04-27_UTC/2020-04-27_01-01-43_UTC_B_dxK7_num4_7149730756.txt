With many social-driven initiatives going on, it is heartening to see individuals pool resources for the vulnerable. #PowerGoodMondays aim to play our part by raising awareness for the affected communities.⠀
⠀
Featuring our #ChangeMakersSG @cultivate_c – a social enterprise which seeks to empower people to live sustainably and connect with nature. Through unique hands-on experiences, they design and deliver regenerative food garden programmes for all ages.⠀
⠀
However, Cultivate Central has lost over 80% of revenue ever since Learning Journey sessions for schools were suspended in January. It has since seen multiple cancellations of their engagements due to COVID-19 situation.⠀
⠀
As with many small businesses, Cultivate Central adapted by moving some of their offerings online. Together, we can support their e-initiatives on their Instagram page, and help build a community that composes food for good! ⠀
⠀
Let’s support our local businesses and kick-start our very own earth-care journey today. ⠀
