Love NEVER fails

I think Love is complicated and simple at the same time. Why? 
It’s complicated - I mean... how many heartbreaks, fights, and butterflies have we gone through as we grow up? With our family, friends, lovers, and even ourselves. We probably still learning what love is every other day. 
It’s simple - when a child loves you, they just do. If you try to ask them, they can’t pinpoint and tell you why. & I think that’s the most pure and genuine form of love 🥰

I hope that in this period, you have a newfound love and find the simplest joy within ☺️ What does love mean to you? ❤️
