With #WFH as the new norm, most of us will be working from a makeshift home office (which takes less than 10 seconds of commute), where meetings are held via Zoom or Skype and work attire is optional. While we could still adapt to all these new but necessary changes, we do miss the days when we can get our usual daily cup of Joe conveniently to kick start our day.⠀
⠀
So if you need to get your caffeine fix or just want to banish that post-lunch lethargy, stay in and we will deliver your #WFH coffee to you via our delivery partners, @grabfoodsg, @foodpandasg and @deliveroo_sg. And if there are many coffee lovers at home, do check out our coffee bundle which includes 4 cups of large-sized hot coffee at just $22.00. 
Also available for takeaway except for outlets at Millenia Walk and Capital Tower. ⠀
