😋Taste: 7/10. It was a clean-out-the-fridge kind of day! Found wing beans, and decided to toss it in leftover curry paste from making Indonesian food the other night. Added coconut flakes, as well as gula melaka and lime juice to create a nice dressing for the salad! The combination worked - great way to get greens into the meal, and would definitely make this again.
