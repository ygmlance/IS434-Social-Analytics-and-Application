It's 2 weeks away from Mother's Day and Nyanya had it figured out by celebrating #MothersDay2020 with #ChilliPadiNonyaRestaurant! Simply by logging on to www.chillipadinonya.oddle.me, Nyanya has managed to reserve a feast for an intimate celebration with her family. It's the moment that matters, spending time with family during this #stayhome season. .
