Happy Monday everyone! Third week into Circuit Breaker ☄️ and this has become my new normalcy!
.
While we all expect to be more effective than ever, reality often puts us in check. But the only way to get through this, is to finally stop to smell the roses 🌹 and enjoy the little things. 👶🏻 And I am thoroughly enjoying this little creature’s siao zharbor antics 🤡 Have a great week everyone, and stay home ah!
