CB Transformation Challenge Day 20
.
I'm struggling to continue on this journey. It's getting harder to motivate myself everyday. I miss the gym. The interactions. The freedom.
.
After a 2.25 HR long department meeting, I was also mentally drained. But I pushed on, regardless, to exercise.
.
So I'm posting this to remind myself why I started this journey and how far I've come, since Feb 5.
.
And to remind my friends who've promised to come along this journey with me to stay the journey too.
