Digitalisation Journey Part 3: On-The-Go Consultation. Anytime, Anywhere.

With the switch to home-based learning in schools, some students have found it difficult to catch up or concentrate on their school content due to the high daily screen time on their computers.

We also understand that our habitat students might have trouble fully concentrating behind the screen during the 2 hour session. Hence, we have further encouraged students to consult us during non-lesson time if they stumble across challenges for school or tuition work.

Students are free to consult Habitat tutors anytime, anywhere. They can simply snap and send a photo of the question and just ask away! We will continue to ensure that all Habitat students can receive the help they need - Just Like Normal Lessons!
