Who wouldnâ€™t love to lounge with a book in this corner all day! ðŸ“šThank you Margherita for choosing our cotton Moroccan rug!

Regram from @margheangeli 
Some days ago our landlord took back his tv and Iâ€™m so happy about it! 
Weâ€™ve been living without a television for the past 11 years and to have one here in the middle of our living room felt a bit weird. 
Iâ€™m a big cinema lover and I canâ€™t wait to feel again that big screen connection with a movie - at home - through a beamer! (coming soon)
