Day 45 Circuit breaker desserts.
You can never be a Gudetama when comes to making desserts.
So many steps which I can't skipped.😁
Rainbow Tang Yuan 汤圆 Dumplings.
Make from scratch. My first time doing. I always buy ready to eat or frozen one from supermarkets.
I roll out the glutinous rice roll and divide into 8 parts. Add in the peanuts and roll into small 8 balls. Dotted them with colour markers. When water is boiled, drop in the light colours first . 2 batches ( one light & 1 dark colours ).
First batch done put in cold water. Do the same on the other batch.
Cooked the soup with ginger,  winter melon strips, red dates.
When soup is done, dropped in the 8 balls.
When they are floating & dancing. Served.
