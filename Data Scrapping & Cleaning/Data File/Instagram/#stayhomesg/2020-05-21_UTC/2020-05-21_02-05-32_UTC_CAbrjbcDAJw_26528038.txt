Stages of Reopening announced and not much is changing so I’m conjuring a little happy with a makeshift shoot in my bedroom…again. #Day117 .

So many little secrets in this photo. The background? An @innikachoo dress hanging on my closet door and taped up to cover the expanse (it’s a big dress). The top? Oh it’s my pajamas. What’s on the bottom? My @erikapenaofficial dress rolled into a makeshift skirt (this is often done on beauty shoots). The headscarf: Well, I tried to tie a turban to cover my dirty hair and it just wouldn’t tie right so I gave up and did a pirate look. Don’t believe me? Swipe 👈🏻. But the jewels are straight up gorgeous and no tricks or styling hacks were needed for these beauties! .
