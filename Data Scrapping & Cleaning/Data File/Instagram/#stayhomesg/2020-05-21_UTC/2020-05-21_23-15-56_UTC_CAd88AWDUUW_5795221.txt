ðŸŒ¤what part of the day do you love the most ? I love sleeping in but my favorite part is right after the sun comes up before everything opens up, just when the day is beginning and the air is still cool and fresh and the rush and busyness of the day hasn't really begun yet. Better yet when it's the weekend or a holiday and everyone is truly relaxed and its just a few people outdoors. Just the people setting up shop for the day or out for a morning walk or run...yeah my fav part of the day...oh and breakfast food of course ðŸ˜‚
