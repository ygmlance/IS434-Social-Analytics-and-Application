Day 45 of CB -  it's 糖水 time 😍 let's boil bean curd, ginkgo nuts and barley sweet soup (腐竹白果薏米糖水) it's a healthy, vegan and gluten free dessert. 'chef' Wang preferred the stick version of 腐竹 than the sheet type. the stick version is thicker and has a bite to it after boiling. you can add in quail eggs or normal eggs as well. it takes about 1.5 hr to boil. it good for detoxification and it's low in cholesterol 👍
Happy eating and Healthy living ❤ -
