I‚Äôm christening @uncle_lim_chiak the #FairyFoodFather because his generousity is unmatched. Since the start of this #CircuitBreaker, the man has been blessing numerous foodie friends with excellent meals (a few home-cooked even), most of which he delivers personally.
A couple of days ago, he casually texted to say he would be reaching my home in 15mins to drop off ‚Äúa simple cake‚Äù. Well, it turned out to be the loveliest #PandanCake I have had in years, if not ever. And like I told him afterwards, this variant of cake, as hugely popular with the masses as it is, isn‚Äôt one I tend to have strong have feelings for. But wow, did I do a double-take when I bit into this uber-fluffy chiffon from @oldsengchoong. A collaborative effort with @susanne.decochiffon, it boasted a powerful #pandan fragrance and a moistness that I‚Äôve never encountered in a chiffon cake. Awestruck, and with my mouth still crammed full of the cake, I immediately tried to order one online for my parents but alas, they had sold out. #sadness. 
Oh well, I do hope it will be restocked soonest ü§ûüòâ. #veronicaphuaeats #oldsengchoon #pandanchiffon #chiffoncake #dessertsg #cakesg #burppletastemaker #burpproved #burpple #burpplesg #singaporefood #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #igfood #igfoodie #foodiesofinstagram #foodlover #foodstagram #foodie #instaeat #foodspotting #foodporn #singapore #stayhomesg #loveyourlocalsg
