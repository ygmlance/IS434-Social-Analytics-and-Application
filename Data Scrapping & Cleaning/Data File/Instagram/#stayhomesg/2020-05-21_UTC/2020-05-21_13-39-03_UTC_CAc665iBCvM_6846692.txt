Finally, my Chiffon Cake is a success! 
The previous few attempts turn out rather flat and disappointing 😅. This time, I managed to get it to rise! The ones I baked before were Pandan flavor, so I chose Earl Grey for a change today. 🌿🍃 Thanks to my sister and friends for their suggestions and advice, I got it right this time! 
谢谢Mee wah, 玉满and Alice! Thanks #shopee for delivering the new baking pan on time! 😊
