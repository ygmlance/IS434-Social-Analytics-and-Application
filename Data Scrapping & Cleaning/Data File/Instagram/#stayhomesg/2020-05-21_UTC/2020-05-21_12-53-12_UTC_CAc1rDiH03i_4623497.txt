Do you find a good ol bowl of Maggi noodle soup🍜 as comforting as I do?

I personally have always had Chicken Maggi noodles, but fairly recently have been buying their Curry Maggi.

And I’ve discovered it is FREAKING AMAZING with a slice of CHEESE🧀 on top!

It melts into a fabulously gooey mess in a few seconds, and is a killer combination with the curry soup.

Not sure how I could’ve taken almost 40 years to discover this Maggi noodle hack.. but there you go 🤷🏻‍♀️
