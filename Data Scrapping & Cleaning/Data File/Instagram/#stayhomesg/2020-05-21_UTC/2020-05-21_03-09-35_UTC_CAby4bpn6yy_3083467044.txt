#circuitbreakerday45 / 28(+28) 🗓

This is a hard period for every one. 
Despite anticipating the ease of Circuit Breaker, Business like us will have to wait for a little longer before we can resume as per normal. 
The situation surrounding COVID-19 rapidly changes, and we will continue to evolve our response towards it. Facing it is the only way,  we will keep you posted on our business operations as we hope to see you again soon. 🤗
