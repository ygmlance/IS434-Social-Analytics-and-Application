“It’s healthy, gluten-free, and delicious!
Harusame is a very thin noodle made from mung bean starch.
A most delicate traditional noodle. Easy and quick to make. fun and versatile.
.
Preparation: Boil harusame in hot water for only 2-3 minutes, drained and rinsed with cold water. It is ready to be used in salads or soups without pre- boiling.
I tend to (ALWAYS!) use whatever colourful veggie to make my bowl singggggg.
