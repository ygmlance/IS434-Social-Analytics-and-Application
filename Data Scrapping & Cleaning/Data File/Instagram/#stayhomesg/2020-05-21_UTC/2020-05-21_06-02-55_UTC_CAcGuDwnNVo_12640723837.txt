; Meating Place
One of the best meals we’ve ordered this Circuit Breaker has got to be from @meatingplace.sg.
Just check out that variety. The family definitely love their Wagyu Rice Bowl, Hasselback Potatoes on Tobiko Mayo and BBQ Smoked AnXin Chicken. If you have kids, get their Mac & Cheese. Personally, my favourite is their Beetroot & Fried Cauliflower Salad dressed in an apple cider vinaigrette and finished with savoury crisp bits of umami pumpkin seed crumbs.
There’s definitely something for everyone in the family!
