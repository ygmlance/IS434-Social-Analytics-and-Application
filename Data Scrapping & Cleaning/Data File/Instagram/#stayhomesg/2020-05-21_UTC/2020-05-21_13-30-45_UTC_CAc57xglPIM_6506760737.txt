Had lots of fun producing one of the many collaterals that we've worked on for School of Science & Technology (SST). This hexagon pamphlet is by far, one of the more challenging print design we've conceptualised.⁠

Also, happy Thursday all! We are now one day closer to the end of #CircuitBreaker. Can't wait to finally be meeting all of our lovely friends and family in person, including our amazing creative team and clients.⁠
