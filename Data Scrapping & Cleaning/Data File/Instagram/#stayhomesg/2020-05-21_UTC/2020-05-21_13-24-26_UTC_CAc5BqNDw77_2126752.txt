Watch this and find out how I whipped up my own cup of bubble tea in JUST 15 MINS!!! 😱👍🏼
.
For those who loves efficiency, appreciates quality bubble teas that are not crazily overpriced, this is for you! 💯
.
Unless you have plenty of time to spare, otherwise, forget about the traditional way of making your own BBT, really. I’m mentally drained even at the thought of having to spend 2-3 hours of making them from scratch (or even having to worry if the raw materials are OOS) without even any guarantee that it’ll taste satisfactory. 😟
.
Thanks to @thewhaleteasg X @klooksg (and @beatriceleesn for arranging this SWEET surprise), my CB BBT life has changed forevaaaa!!
.
THIS. IS. IT. 1000000000% RECOMMENDED!!!
☑️ TASTE – Legit!! Tasty pearls + fragrant tea. It’s as good as the ones freshly made in stores! Tastes better than all the other ready-to-drink ones that I’ve ordered for home delivery. ☑️ CONVENIENCE – Instruction card and labelling of ingredients were super clear and straightforward. As mentioned, it took me only a total of 15mins to create my own cuppa!
☑️ PRICE - For only $3.90 per cup on average (35 for a box of 10 cups + $4 delivery fee), plus all the good stuff mentioned above, this purchase is definitely worth every single cent.
