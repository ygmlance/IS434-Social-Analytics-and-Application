[Trying something different but definitely not a stranger to you — which is none other than "Takeaway Food Styling" 📸😄]
•
You might have noticed from my recent posts that I have been eating/making homecooked meals or mainly supporting F&Bs businesses through #thehungertracksavefnb 😄 Today, I've tried styling with takeaway food, something I've never done before for food styling! 🤗

Featuring our local favourite, a popular Southeast Asian dish, Hokkien Prawn Mee (福建蝦麵)🥢. No matter how much food options we have in Singapore, this dish still brings us back to our roots and probably an essential to us right? 🤗 Let me know your favourite Hokkien Mee stalls cos I'm still on the lookout for more mouthwatering ones out there!! 😋
