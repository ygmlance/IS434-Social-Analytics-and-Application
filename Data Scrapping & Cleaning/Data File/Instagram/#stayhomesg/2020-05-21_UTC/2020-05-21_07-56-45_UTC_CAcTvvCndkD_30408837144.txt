In view of the recent news from the government, we will be putting all June appointments on hold. Updates will be released as soon as we receive more information. For customer that have booked with us, you will be prioritised during rescheduling.
We know that this is a tough time for all and we seek your understanding and patience. In the meantime let’s #stayhomesg and stay safe ❤️ #galorebeautysg
