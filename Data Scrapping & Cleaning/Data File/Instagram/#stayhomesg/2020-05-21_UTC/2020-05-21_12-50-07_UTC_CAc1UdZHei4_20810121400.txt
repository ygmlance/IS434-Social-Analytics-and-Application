What is butter chicken without naan???!!! Ok but I like chicken tikka masala more than butter chicken as butter chicken is usually more creamy/milky while chicken tikka masala is usually on the more spicy side.

Wouldn't say this is the best, but it is decent enough. Felt that the butter chicken was too creamy and lacks a tiny abit of kick (there was zero spice level?!) and the chicken tikka masala was not spicy at all and a little too sweet for me 😢 
We got 10pcs of naan (such a suckers for naan HAHAH) and their naans were really hugeee but probably cos it was takeaway, so it lacks the crisp on top of the naan. Could have been better if I eat there maybe?

On a side note: think their prata curry is too watery for me too :( Its a new outlet of Al-Azhar here, and hope the food gets better 🙏🏽 Overall, isn't something that I will go back again but at least my naan cravings is satisfied for now 😌
