Learning how to make taro balls from my mom‚Äôs friend who use to run a dessert üç® shop. When something is handmade there is always more than just textures and inconsistencies in your mouth that make it tasty. It affects the people making it too, slows us down to understand our ingredients, food sources and keep us aware of the change of ingredients from season to season. We learn to make mistakes and accept them, pick ourselves up and try again and again with the customers. That‚Äôs what that keep us going, the community, the customers, the friends and family at home. Thank you for sticking with us through circuit breaker. Let‚Äôs all #stayhomesg till Jun and if you need food we are here for you #homemade #taro #grassjelly #bobochacha #wfh #covidnomore #singapore #sgfood #hawkersg #sgheritage #cafesg #comfortfood #lifelonglearning
