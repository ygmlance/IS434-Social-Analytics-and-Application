Stay Home Cooking Day XX? 
Miso Ramen & Green Curry Ramen w/ vege, mock abalone & century egg.
Quick D.I.Y. meal in the midst of working from home.
Using miso ramen pack from Nature's Glory & the leftover Green Curry soup stock from my Burger creation for the 2nd one. Nothing fancy, just enough to fill us up through this period. ðŸ™‚
