Challenge: “try one of those five minute craft hacks 😂” from @constancemicaela, thank you! 💝
.
As a petite girl, this hack is super useful for me because most of the time, my belts are either way too long or sticking out from my waist and I have to shift the belt around so I can tuck it into my belt loop (that is, if the outfit I’m wearing even has them).

I learnt this trick from @fashioninflux!
