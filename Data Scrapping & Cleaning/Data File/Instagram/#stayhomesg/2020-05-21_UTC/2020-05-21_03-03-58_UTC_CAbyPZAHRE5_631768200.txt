Day 45 Circuit breaker. My kind of Chinese Big breakfast.😁
Two eggs with a chicken drumstick.
Used Sweet potatoes Mee Sua.
I love the colour of this Mee Sua.
It is of course higher price than normal white mee sua.
It is less starchy too. But i still washed / rinsed off before putting it together with the chicken stock.
You can see my soup very clear. 😊
