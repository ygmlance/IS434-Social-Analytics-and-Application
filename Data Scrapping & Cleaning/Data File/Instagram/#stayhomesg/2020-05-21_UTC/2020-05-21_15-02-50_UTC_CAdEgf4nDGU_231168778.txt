Day 45 of #stayhomesg #circuitbreakersg ***
I’ve made some progress on the Arne & Carlos doll. But I’ve to take a knitting break because my hands hurt a bit.
***
The little knitted ones have found Chicken’s hat. Now they want one each but they’ll have to wait for my hand to heal.

Today the library emailed that the temporary closure will be extended beyond 1st June until further notice. <sob>
