210520 / push ups
HONESTLY i am really bad at push ups (I could barely do 1 a few months back and here you can probably see 3 proper ones) but just posting this for the #castayhomechallenge and to match the number of pull ups I did LOL
--
on a side note, am I even doing it right? I've never had formal instructions on Perfect Push Up 101 so I tried to do this as thoughtfully and properly as I could - anyone has any ideas to improve?
