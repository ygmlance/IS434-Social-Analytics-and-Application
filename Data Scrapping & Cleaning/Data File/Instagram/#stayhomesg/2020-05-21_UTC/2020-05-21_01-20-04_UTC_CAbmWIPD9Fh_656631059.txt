Did you know that giving back has a lot positive benefits to our physical, emotional and mental state? 🧘‍♀️⠀
•⠀
One of the many research studies on the relationship of giving and happiness 😊 was done by Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton in their study “Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending”. They studied the link between wealth and happiness and discovered that money 💸  could lead to happiness—if we spend it the right way. One of those right ways turned out to be spending on others, and that when we do so, we become happier. 💁⠀
