From #instasgSundayShapes, a cool edit by @momentos_sg of the insta-beloved building. We love how Miguel composed the shots buy using the colorful rectangles positioned in the perfect balance, and the edit... well maybe we just feel a little emo in this extended CB period.

Thanks to all who have joined, we shall have the post-together session again on Sunday 10 PM, stay tuned for the theme to be announced soon.
