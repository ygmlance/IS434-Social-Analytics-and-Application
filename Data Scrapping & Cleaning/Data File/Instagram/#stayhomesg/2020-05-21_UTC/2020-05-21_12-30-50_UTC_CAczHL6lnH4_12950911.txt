3 years old Logan loves ROBOTS, FIREFIGHTERS & ASTRONAUTS! One of his birthday presents arrived in this big box (@murugan22) and he said “Amma, I have a GREAT idea! Let’s use this box to make a big robot!”.💡🤖
..
These days, he loves taking the lead on projects! For this robot project, he brainstormed with me, thought about the materials we needed, coloured/painted one of the sides red, helped me cut out the box flaps (I’m so amazed by his cutting skills!), told me where to cut holes with my penknife, helped me with the markings, cut the scotch tape while I held it, pasted it with me and then said, “Can I try it on, Amma?”. We were supposed to make buttons & the antenna but I got carried away by all the cuteness!! SO CUTE, this little robot!!
..
By the end of 2020, I’m pretty sure we would have built a real working robot with supercool functions!! And I love fuelling his passion for making things! ✂️ ❤️
