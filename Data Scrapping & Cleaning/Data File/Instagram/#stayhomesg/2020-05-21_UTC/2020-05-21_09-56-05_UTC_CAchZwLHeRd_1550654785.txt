Welcome back @thefussyfoodie_ and we are glad that you enjoyed our Chrysanthemum Ai-Yu dessert! Great idea to pair it with your favourite 🍇 pearl jelly too. Thank you for such an amazing and artistic shot 💜

Now that @ninefresh is back in business I finally tried their Chrysanthemum Ai-yu special, opting for variation A with honey popping jelly, grape pearl jelly and taro balls.

The chrysanthemum makes the dessert feel a lot more refreshing and I was surprised that real chrysanthemum flowers can be found within the ai-yu, although as a personal preference I would prefer the regular ai-yu. Regardless, the Taiwanese dessert bowl was as enjoyable as always, and the honey popping jelly is SO GOOD OMG —  y'all better not miss out on this topping while it's available! Very happy also that my favourite grape pearl jelly is part of the set. ☺️❤️
