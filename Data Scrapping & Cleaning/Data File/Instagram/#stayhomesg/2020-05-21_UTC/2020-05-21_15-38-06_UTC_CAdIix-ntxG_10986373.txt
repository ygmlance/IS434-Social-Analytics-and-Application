The second episode of Iso.Date is airing May 22 at 6pm SG time / 5pm BKK!
⠀
Our daters this week are R. and Y. in Singapore. We’re hiding their names until we go live.
⠀
On this LIVE reality dating show and social experiment, Coconuts TV will be broadcasting blind dates between strangers who are stuck at home during the pandemic, but still looking for love.
⠀
Will sparks fly? Or will the cringe be unbearable? We really don’t know, and that’s sort of the point. This is live romantic dating action, you guys! ⠀
Grab some popcorn, get your commenting keyboard fingers ready, and tune in. ⠀
Link in bio to subscribe to our YouTube channel and set a reminder so as not to miss this big date!
