Half-baked honey vanilla kasutera 半熟カステラ 🍯 || slowing down and revisiting one of the treats that I used to enjoy back in japan, defined by the rich eggy flavor sweetened with honey and oozing out just that right amount of gooey deliciousness in the center. 
On a side note, if there’s anything that u wish to have it in future bake sales menu, simply leave a comment here or any other bakes that I’ve posted 😉 •
