Little Asher is having some fun times exploring shapes and colours with our mess-free foil art activity kits!

Juggling between WFM & the kids, it is often inevitable to resort in giving screen time as a quick fix solution. However, we believe that in times like this, it is still important to find easy means for the little ones continue to engage in meaningful activities at home for the interest of their development.

Thanks mummy @denisetaytay for sharing this lovely photo!
