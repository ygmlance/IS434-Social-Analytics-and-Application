I tend not to have structured activities with the elder boy because he cannot focus, so i usually try to incorporate play in his learning.

One of the things i wanted to teach him is Chinese. I knew that he knows some words already but i don't know what he knows apart from 1 to 10, so i decided to Google search for the top 100 Chinese characters and picked a few for him to learn using the Lego board. But..... he already knew all of them even before i started ðŸ˜… i guess now the key now is to let him see more of these words so that he will remember. His preschool does a very good job in teaching Chinese as he went from not knowing how to speak to arguing with you in Chinese ðŸ˜‚

Fyi: the above Lego board idea is inspired by @happytotshelf ðŸ˜€
