Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the effectiveness of the circuit breaker measures in controlling community transmission of COVID-19 in Singapore. With the gradual, calibrated easing of circuit breaker measures post-June 1, we will continue to take necessary precautions in maintaining good hygiene as well as wearing a mask and practicing social distancing in public areas. Hope our lives would return to normal soon.
