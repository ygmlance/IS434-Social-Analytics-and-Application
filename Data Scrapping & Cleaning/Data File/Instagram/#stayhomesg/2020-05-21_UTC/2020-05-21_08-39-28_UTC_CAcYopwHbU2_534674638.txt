With the new baby coming, I can’t help thinking if Jude may feel neglected - was inspired to do this abstract painting activity together with Jude, framed with his newborn footprint. May this son & mother artwork always remind us of the connection & bond we have shared from the moment God created you in my womb.. My love for you will only grow, son ❤️ (swipe to see the bts of this little 👨🏼‍🎨. I chose the colours, he did most of the painting while I ‘pointilism-ed’ over his pencil drawings)
