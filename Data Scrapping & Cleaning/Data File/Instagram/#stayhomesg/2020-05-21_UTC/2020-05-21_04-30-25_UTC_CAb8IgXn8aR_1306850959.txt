🏖There are times when the heart and mind are overwhelmed by silence. Times when the roaring world retreats and leaves us to discover peace. So brief a respite. Cherish the moment.🏖 Cherish the moment(s) now- the working from home moment; the time spent with family moment; the home baking and home cooking moment; the stay at home moment. Today, I’m finally eating Mac breakfast again via delivery. 😍😍😍No chocolate food art today (though I might do one later just for fun). Because I really want to cherish the moment and eat my Sausage McMuffin with egg and harshbrown while they are still warm! 🤗 Nevertheless, I did hearts coffee stencil art on my vanilla latte Starbucks quickly to signify my ❤️❤️❤️ for today’s breakfast! 好吃!😋😋😋 🤩🤩🤩 Oh! Special mention to my new pastel pink orchids! So sweet and looking like sakura! 🥰🥰🥰
