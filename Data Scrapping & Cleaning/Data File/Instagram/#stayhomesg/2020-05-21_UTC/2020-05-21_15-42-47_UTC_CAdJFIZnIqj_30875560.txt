[ 21 May 2020 // Circuit Breaker Day 45 ] Knowing that the kids will be returning to school in less than 2 weeks, I’m starting to fully cherish the moments that I have with them at home.. These photos were taken this afternoon, when Natalie was quietly playing with her soft toys in the bedroom 🧸💕. Every day, she’ll line up her soft toys on the bed and she’ll pair similar-looking ones together to form a family. She’ll then pretend-play with the soft toys and it’s really adorable to see her forming stories and getting all wrapped up in her own little world 🥰. Once in a while, her elder brothers will sneak into the room and join her. 👦🏻👧🏻

It’s one of those moments like this, when my daughter plays quietly with her soft toys in her room, that I will miss when they return to school 🥺. We’ll still be working from home while the kids are back in school, and although the break from our kids is very much needed 😅, I’ll definitely miss their constant chatter, their screams of delight and most importantly, their hugs which we’ve been receiving throughout the day ✨. As their mom, I hope that they will have a safe and wonderful back-to-school experience but until then, I’ll be giving them more hugs and kisses while they’re still at home. 🥰💕
