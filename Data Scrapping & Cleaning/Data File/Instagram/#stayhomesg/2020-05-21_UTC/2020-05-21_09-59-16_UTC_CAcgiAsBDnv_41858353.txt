‚Å£So this was gonna a video on a Thai squid stir fry dish but I somehow managed to record every single stage of the process and didn't press record when I actually cooked the dish... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so this is me trying to salvage it by turning it into a crispy garlic tutorial. I realised some of you had trouble with it when making garlic fried rice. My general pointers are:‚†Ä
‚†Ä
-Slice the garlic as thinly as possible‚†Ä
-You're obviously going to need oil to fry the garlic chips but you actually don't need a lot, tilt your pot or pan at an angle so the oil collects on one side. This will allow you to shallow fry the garlic chips without using a ton of oil ‚†Ä
-Put the garlic in when the oil and pan are cold or not too hot, then slowly bring it up to medium heat ‚†Ä
-Constantly move the garlic around so that you're separating the sliced garlic and also to distribute the heat evenly so that you don't get hot spots ‚†Ä
-Once your garlic starts to brown, drop the heat down to low and keep a watch on it because thinly sliced garlic burns so so quickly and it becomes very bitter. Immediately transfer it out once you have a nice golden brown‚†Ä
-You can use the same method to fry herbs as well(I used kaffir lime leaves), but put it in when the oil is hot and it'll only take 10 or so seconds to get crispy‚†Ä
-Crispy condiments are amazing on rice... or sprinkled on stir frys for texture, and they also flavor the oil in the pan so you have a good foundation to cook another dish ‚†Ä
