Water activity is their favourite so decided to let them play with water and sponge. Was supposed to be an activity to entertain the younger one but the elder boy took more interest in it. I think he was amazed by how he could so quickly use the sponge to transfer the water from the container using the bottle. He kept doing that for at least 20mins.
