We spoke to Wei Yi, and he shared that he has been dabbling in the F&B business since his University days.  While studying, he had worked part time at his relatives Hokkien Mee stall. After graduating, he went on to work at Tenderfresh as a manager. In 2017, on his uncles prompt, he decided to join his uncle in running a beef noodle stall business. 
While business has dropped by more than half during this COVID-19 period, he is thankful that heâ€™s still able to carry on and serve a small quantity of his customers.

He hopes that everyone will be able to support local F&B during these trying times. He believes all local F&B stalls will do their best to put delicious meals on your table while you stay home.
