Yes, WE CAN HELP!

Because of the restrictions to dining in, some F&B outlets have lost as much as 90% of their traffic from pre-Covid days.

The owners of these businesses may be our neighbours, friends, or family! Let's continue to support them by making a conscious choice to order our "eating out" meals from smaller outlets like hawkers and boutique restaurants :) #SGLocalShops #stayhomesg #sgunited
