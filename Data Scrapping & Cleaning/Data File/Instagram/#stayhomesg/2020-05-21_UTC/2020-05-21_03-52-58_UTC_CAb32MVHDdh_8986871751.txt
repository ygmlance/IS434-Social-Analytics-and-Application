Hello beautiful ladies, I hope everyone is doing alright. Like most of you, I am trying my best to manage life with the lockdown restrictions in Romania. 👩‍👧 Ever since the lockdown, I do lots of things with my daughter Leah. She is at the age when she wants to do everything with me and always be around me, so it’s difficult to do much else with her around.🤷‍♀️⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Here's a little peek into what I do each day, to give you some idea of life on another side of the globe! ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
👣 We are still able to go outside for short walks around the neighbourhood but not the park, and just admire the blooming trees and flowers. We've had some lovely weather here (more summer than spring) so it’s been nice to get some fresh air, even if only for a little bit 🌸⁠⠀
⁠⠀
🎨 We do a lot of play pretend, puzzles, and reading. We also color and paint using some arts & crafts ideas from her kindergarten teachers online.⁠⠀
⁠⠀ 💃To prepare for the weather change I was putting the winter clothes away and brought out the spring/summer clothes. That prompted a dress-up party with her going through all my clothes🤣. I even got to make a video of some of the styles for my Instagram (swipe to the last picture).⁠⠀
⁠⠀
👩‍🍳When I cook, she wants to help as well, so I try to get her involved in the process.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
👩‍🎨If she naps in the afternoon which is rare now, I seize the chance to work on some stuff like my mood boards on the Girlsourced app or just relax 🛌⁠⠀
⁠⠀
📺To unwind in the evening, I take some time for myself and do some reading. Otherwise, I spend some time with the husband, catching a movie with him while the little one sleeps.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
🥳The highlight of this month was on 18th May, that was one special day where we celebrated Leah's 3rd birthday, so we focused a lot on her.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
That about wraps up #adayinthelifeofme! I hope some of these inspire you with what you can do or at least kept you entertained!😉 If you are looking for more entertainment, get the Girlsourced app, and start engaging in the community to earn points while you seek style advice or respond to others.
