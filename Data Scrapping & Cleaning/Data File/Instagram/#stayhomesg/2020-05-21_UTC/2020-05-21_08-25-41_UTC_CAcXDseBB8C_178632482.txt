21st May 2020 - Someone told me I must be running a cartel or part of the reason that we are running out of flour.  Well, maybe I am! Lol!  I love purple! Purple stuff is hard to find in the sea of pinks, blues and blacks. Purple sweet potato bread with the paste made from scratch! I used sweet potatoes from Kagoshima, Japan and the colour is really a beautiful deep purple! Yumms!
