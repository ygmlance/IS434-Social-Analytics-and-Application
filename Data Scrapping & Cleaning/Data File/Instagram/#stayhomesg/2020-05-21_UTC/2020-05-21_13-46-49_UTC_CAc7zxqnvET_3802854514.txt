The hubby loves to eat breastmeat so his lunch was seafood pasta with wafu sauce top with rosemary chicken. Pasta was purposefully made milder than usual to accommodate the flavourful rosemary chik, seafood however absorb the wafu seasoning so well. The hub likes the overall flavour and the cafe platting! Simply like dining in cafe! #weekdaylunch #homecooking #homecookedisthebest #rosemarychickenbreast #japanesestyle #seafoodpasta #wafusauce #和风料理 #fusion #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodie #stayhomesg #stayhome #westerncomfortfood #onthewifedinningtable
