Think of @omnikitchen.sg’s “Local Lemak” (swipe to see a close-up) as the peace-loving mediator when your heart craves #NasiLemak but your conscience tut-tuts. It has sautéed sambal shrimp nasi lemak using organic brown grains instead of white rice, cashew nuts, crispy ikan bilis, and blanched kangkong (current price $9.90 - usual $11.90). Honestly I was expecting something blander since it sounded rather healthy but nope, the flavour was robust and the spiciness was uncompromised.
If you like fish, #omnikitchensg’s “Salmon #Ratatouille” is a good choice. You get a slab of baked Norwegian #Salmon with al dente fusilli plus a big scoop of vegetables stewed in a tomato-based sauce. This healthy dish is now going for $13.90 instead of the usual $15.90.
