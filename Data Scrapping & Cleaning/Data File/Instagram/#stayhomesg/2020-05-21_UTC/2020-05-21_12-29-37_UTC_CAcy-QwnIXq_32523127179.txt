😋Taste: 9/10. Our mamabear has been pestering us to make #peasoup, so we finally did it! Simple to make and extremely tasty, though if you don’t like peas we would not recommend 🙈. The pesto was excellent - bright and robust. We used leftover #greencurry paste from Thai food night and leftover #curryleafpesto as the base. Such a great clean-out-fridge recipe, and avoids the need to use basil which can be relatively pricey.
