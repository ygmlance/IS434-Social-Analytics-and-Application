Circuit breaker day 45: made a pot of winter melon chicken soup to 'reduce' the 'heatiness' in this hot weather. ☀️
.
All I had for lunch was a bowl of soup with a huge chicken thigh as I had a heavy brekkie of fried bee hoon again. 🙊
.
We are another step towards end of CB. Are you looking forward to it? 💯
