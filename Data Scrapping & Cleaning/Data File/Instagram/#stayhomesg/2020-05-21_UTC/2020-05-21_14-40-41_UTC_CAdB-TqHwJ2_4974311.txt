[20.05.20] Day 44 of #circuitbreaker:

Reorganized my art & stationery trolley to make space for the soft pastels and tools I got for the Nagomi art workshops I’ve been attending this circuit breaker. 
Happier working on the art pieces with easier access to my materials and more space on the table!
