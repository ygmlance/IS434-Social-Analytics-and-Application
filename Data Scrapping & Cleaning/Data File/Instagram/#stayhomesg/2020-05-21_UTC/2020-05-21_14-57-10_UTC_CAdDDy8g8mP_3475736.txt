Day 44 of circuit breaker, my baby son saying night night to me when I am not around to make him sleep. These few days were super busy for me as I got exam to study. Today evening is my exam, so I lock myself in room to prevent any distractions. By the time my exam end, he will be sleeping. My husband send me this video of Ledys saying night night to me. My heart melt. During this circuit breaker, I had taught Lepdys to say night night to everyone before he goes to bed. Hope to maintain this lovable habit. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #nightnight #nightnightime #saygoodnight #examover #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #tahanonthuz
