7 seconds isn’t a long time… But it could make all the difference for our #LocalHeroes and the F&B outlets on @grabfoodsg. Give your favourite restaurants, cafes, hawkers, drink and snack stalls the exposure they deserve by scoring them free ad spaces from Grab, and a $20 GrabFood voucher for yourself!

All you need to do is...
📷 Take a 7sec video of you and the food
📍 Tag #GF7SecAd and the F&B outlet’s name, before 8 June 👍 Post it on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok or all of them!

Don’t forget to switch your profile to public mode so people can see your 7-second shout out. Post as many videos as you want because the more your videos your F&B outlet gets, they more they’ll be featured! Find out more: grb.to/GF7SecAd *T&C apply
