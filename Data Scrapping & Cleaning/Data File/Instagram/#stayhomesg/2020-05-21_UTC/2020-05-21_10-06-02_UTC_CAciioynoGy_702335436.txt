Hushan Great Wall. Liaoning, China. Apr'12.

The easternmost point of the Great Wall is located in China's Liaoning province. Before its discovery in 1989, it was thought that the Great Wall of China ended in Shanhaiguan, some 400km further west.

This section of the wall, known as the Hushan (Tiger Mountain) Great Wall, was built during the Ming period. Though the Koreas see this as Bakjak fortress, remains from the ancient Goguryeo Kingdom. The current rebuilt section of the wall runs more than 1 kilometer up the mountain before descending towards the Yalu River.

There was only one other tourist on that day, a local from Sichuan. We hiked up the wall and beyond. From atop the wall, I could see DPRK across the Yalu River. The way back was via a rather precarious trail which ran parallel to the river. At one point there was a rock monument indicating the narrowest point of the river 'One Step Across' where one could allegedly take a(n unrealistically large) step across to North Korea.

The Hushan Great Wall is an interesting less visited section of the Great Wall. Have you visited the Great Wall of China? Which section?
