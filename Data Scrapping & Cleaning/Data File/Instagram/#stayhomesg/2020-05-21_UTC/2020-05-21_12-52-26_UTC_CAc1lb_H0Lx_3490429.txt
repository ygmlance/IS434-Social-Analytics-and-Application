4 days of IVACON - EUROPE starts today! I’m truly excited to be learning again and be meeting those I missed at the US conference. To be honest, I have not one single day to sleep in but stayed up to complete many more tasks since the circuit breaker, much more came on my plate lately. 🏠. I do envy 😯 the countless stories I heard from friends who are finding time for reflection and their hobbies. I guess It can still be true for me, I’ll get to enjoy the busyness and smell the flowers at the same time!!! Always  grateful! #ivacon2020 #vocaladvancement #stayhomesg #adelineganvocalstudio
