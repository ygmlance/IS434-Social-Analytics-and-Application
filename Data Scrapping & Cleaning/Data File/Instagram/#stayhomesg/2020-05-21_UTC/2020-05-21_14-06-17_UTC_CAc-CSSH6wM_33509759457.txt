Despite the movement restrictions, many of Singapore's beloved annual events are finding creative ways to meet us where we are: at home. Until May 31, @sgcocktailfest has partnered with over 20 bars to serve all-original tipples to you via delivery or takeaway. There are even three online cocktail-making classes, where participants receive their boozy class materials delivered in advance. ðŸ“¸ @madamefansg
