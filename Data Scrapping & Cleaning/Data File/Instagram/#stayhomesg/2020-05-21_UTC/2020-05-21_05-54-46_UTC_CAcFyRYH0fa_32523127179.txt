🍴Ease of cooking: 8/10

🛒Ingredients: diced chicken breast and chicken thigh, leeks, shiitake mushrooms, capsicum, red onions, tuna, scallops. For the tare: soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin, sake
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: simply cut the desired ingredients into cubes, put it on a stick, and grill it over charcoal. Brush it with oil and tare as it grills.
.
😋Taste: 9/10. Barbecued meats and vegetables (and tare!) are a match made in heaven! The hardest part of the process was getting the fire and embers to the right point for grilling. Everyone had different favourites, but the #grilledscallops - lightly seasoned with freshly ground pepper - developed a char and umami that took us by surprise!
