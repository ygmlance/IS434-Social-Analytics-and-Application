Miso Salmon, $21 from 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞.⠀
⠀
We have always enjoyed the foods and it’s cosy atmosphere at The Communal Place. But we couldn’t wait any longer before the dine-in restriction is lifted hence we decided to place an online order and opt for Self Pick-up. Payment was made by PayNow, and our food is just ready for Pick-up when we arrived, perfect timing and it was fuss-free! ⠀

⠀
Miso Salmon is one of our favourite dish here! A huge slab of salmon that’s well pan-seared and lightly seasoned to preserve its freshness. Indulging together with their miso glazed on top of it, creamy mash potato on the side which it’s too irresistible and some green veg! It’s a super worthy meal to get it now as they are running a fiery promotion of BUY 2 GET 1 FREE! Head over to their website or Instagram page to find out more. ⠀
