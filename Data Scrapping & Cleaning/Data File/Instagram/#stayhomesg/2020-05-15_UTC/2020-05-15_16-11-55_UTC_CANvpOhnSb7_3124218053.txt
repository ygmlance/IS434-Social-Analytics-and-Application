Day 39 of Singapore’s Circuit Breaker period and I have not done a single thing on my “now-that-I-have-the-time-to-do-list”. I told myself that I will be really super productive - painting and drawing something every day, set up my new paint palette, Marie Kondo my art drawers and wardrobe, pick up my yoga practice again and take up online classes to learn something new. .

No..not a single item that I can tick off on the list. But I am okay with that. I still draw, taking my time to get it right rather than rushing out something just so that I have something to post on IG.  Instead I spend my time coming up with new dishes every day and just doing stuffs together with my husband and the kids as we stay home. And I couldn’t be happier. Oh..don’t worry, I would NEVER ever trade my paints and brushes for kitchen utensils. 😄

So what are you doing that makes you happy during this extraordinary times?
