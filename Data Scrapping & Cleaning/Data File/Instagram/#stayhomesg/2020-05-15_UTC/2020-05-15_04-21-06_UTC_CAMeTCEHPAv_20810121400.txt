My first time trying almond butter and I really love it!! ðŸ’¯ (also bcos I love almonds hahaha) but texture wise, its more gluey than peanut butter spread. 
Also, happen to see this corn thins in fairprice (about 5sgd), and its really nice even on its own?! I expected it to be tasteless and really bland but the sesame taste and smell came really well and strong enough. Plus points its that each corn thins are only 23 calories!!! ðŸ¥°

Its gonna be my go-to snack now ðŸ˜Œ
