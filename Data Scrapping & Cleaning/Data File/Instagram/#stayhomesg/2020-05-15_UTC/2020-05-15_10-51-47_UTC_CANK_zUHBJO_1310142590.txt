✨NEW✨ Proudly introducing this top-grade, gem-quality Chrysoberyl Cat's Eye. I have seen many cat's eyes, either color is too dull or heavily included, and some I hardly see chatoyance (centre line) on them, mostly available in the market are these types of low quality Cat's eyes. I have collectors who came to me to look for one with honey-color, top transparency (clean), well centred, straight and very pronounced(sharp) chatoyance, but sometimes they really got to wait for years for quality like this.. Admire how stunning this GRS certified 4ct Cat's eye is! Truly rare piece! 💍💎💯💖
