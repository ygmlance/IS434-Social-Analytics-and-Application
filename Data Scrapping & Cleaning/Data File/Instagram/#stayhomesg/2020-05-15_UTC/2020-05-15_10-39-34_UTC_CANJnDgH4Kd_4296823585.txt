My results are phenomenal! I lost 22kg in 19 weeks, from 85kg to 63kg. My body fat was not measurable initially because I was overweight, but at the end of the transformation, I was 12-13%. I now feel very confident of myself, and I feel nothing is impossible anymore!"⁠

Having been overweight for over 20 years, Nick didn’t think it would be possible to lose weight in his 40s.⁠
.⁠
.⁠
But as his lack of energy started affecting the time he spent with his two young children, he decided it was time to knuckle down and get fit.⁠
.⁠
.⁠
He chose to go with the best in the business and joined @upfitnesssg.⁠

The motivation and support provided by U.P. changed the way Nick approached his fitness and health - what seemed impossible, just a few months ago became completely doable.⁠

"U.P. has been the best and fastest and most beneficial ‘return on investment’ I have ever received! Not only have I changed physically and aesthetically, but also mentally. And that can-do attitude is the biggest benefit for me."⁠
