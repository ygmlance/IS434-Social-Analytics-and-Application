Flour, butter, milk, 3 basic ingredients, put them together in different variations and you get bread, cakes, cookies etc. Made a batch of lovely tall and buttery biscuits with the same 3 ingredients, shredded in some cheddar and a few sprigs of thyme for flavor. Itâ€™s so good and addictive. #biscuits #homebaking #sgbakes #stayhomecookingchallenge #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeforsg #sgeats #singaporehomecooks #stfoodtrending #sgfood #burpple #sghomebaker #huffposttaste #buzzfeedfood #foodgram #sgfoodies #foodphotography #foodstagram #heresmyfood #foodbeast #gloobyfood #forkyeah #stayhomesg #foodgawker #thekitchn #foodiegram #bonappetit #lifeandthyme #foodpics #foodspotting
