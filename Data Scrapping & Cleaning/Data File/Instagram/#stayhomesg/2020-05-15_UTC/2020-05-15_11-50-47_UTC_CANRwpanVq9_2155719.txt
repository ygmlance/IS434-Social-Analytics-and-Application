Tonight I’m serving Vietnamese Grilled Pork Chop Rice 🇻🇳 Prepared the Nuoc Cham Dressing to spoon over the juicy pork chop. It’s a simple and comfort food. Vietnamese grilled pork chop is marinated in sugar, pepper, garlic, lemongrass and fish sauce. Thenafter you may panfry or grill it to have a little charred. 
I have prepared a Japanese appetizer which is great to serve with this rice. I have done Pickled Yuzu Daikon. This pickle is easy to make and so refreshing!
