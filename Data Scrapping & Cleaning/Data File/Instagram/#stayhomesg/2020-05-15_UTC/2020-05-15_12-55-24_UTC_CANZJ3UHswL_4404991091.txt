“Tonight was our second time ordering our dinner from Carlton City Hotel. We had the 150gm Wagyu Beef Burger, Seafood Fusilli Marinara, Seafood Fried Rice and Spicy Drumlets. As usual, food portion was big, and food arrived earlier than time allocated. Happy with our meal!” - Brigit Alicia, Facebook Review* on 10 May 2020.⁣
