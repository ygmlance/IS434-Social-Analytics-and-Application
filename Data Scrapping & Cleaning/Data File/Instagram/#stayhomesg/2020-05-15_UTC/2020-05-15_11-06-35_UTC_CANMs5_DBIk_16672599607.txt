Breaking Circuit D39...
MAKAN...No pasta, minimal meat, no can & a whiff of cheese Lasagna. Courgette, tempeh, nutritional yeast flakes and fresh tomato sauce are the big keys. Fresh balcony basil is the biggest one. Not making a choice, IS a choice. This is mine. I like what I like and I need what maked me happy. Less is more... Lazillions delicious! It's a keeper...
