Day 39 dinner.
Organic Barley Brown rice porridge again.
This is not eight treasure or 八宝粥。
Just simple ingredients consist of yellow & orange sweet potatoes,  carrots,  tomatoes,  cauliflower, bean curd sheets, egg, luncheon meat & very unique mini Abalone Hay bee Hiam chilli.
Including organic brown rice & barley,  i have ten treasures 十宝。 
This bowl of porridge is 人间美味 to me, cause i am a simple person.😊 #jasmine_homecooked #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithst
