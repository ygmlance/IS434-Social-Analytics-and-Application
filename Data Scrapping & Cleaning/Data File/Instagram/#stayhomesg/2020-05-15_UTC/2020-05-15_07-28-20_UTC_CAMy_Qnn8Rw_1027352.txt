So glad I finally got around to ordering from @ratulemper. This place had been on my wishlist for a while after I saw @kenwashio share about their food on his IG Stories.
They are most famous for their #Lemper, a type of traditional Indonesian savoury snack made of glutinous rice filled with a savoury filling and wrapped in banana leaf. #RatuLemper sells theirs in boxes of 10 (priced between $17 and $22) and for the filling, they have Chicken (they offer three degrees of spiciness for this), Beef Rendang, Mutton Satay, Spicy Tuna and Spicy Vegetarian. I tried the Extra Spicy Chicken Lemper and loved it! While the rice was soft, the finely-shredded chicken sandwiched within, really had a good kick of heat.
I also got a few of their Pulut Kuning with Beef Rendang and Sambal Ikan Bilis ($8). Packed with a quail’s egg, cherry tomato and sliced cucumber, the round mounds of sticky yellow rice were fragrant from turmeric. They were topped with a very mildly spicy #rendang that’d been cooked till very soft, almost down to a paste. The sweetish sambal was a tasty complement that introduced more spiciness as well as savoury chewiness from the few dried anchovies in there.
