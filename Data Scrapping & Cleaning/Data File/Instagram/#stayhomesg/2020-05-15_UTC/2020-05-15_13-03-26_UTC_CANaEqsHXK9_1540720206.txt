{{ðŸŒˆTURKEY}} Did you know that these rainbow steps can be found all over Turkey? We found 1 at an obscure alley on the main square of Kayseri, Turkey. In 2013, retired forestry engineer Huseyin Cetinel spent four days transforming huge staircase, from concrete grey, to beautiful rainbow colours. The local government didnâ€™t seem to like it, and painted them back concrete grey, stirring up people throughout the country to paint walkways all over Turkey with rainbow steps. The beautiful thing was... people had assumed it was done as a form of activism, but Huseyin replied that he just wanted to make people smile. ðŸ˜Œ

What colours are you bringing to your neighbourhood/community/people around? It could be a helping hand, a hello, a smile, or just being you-carrying in you something that ignites others. - R âœ¨ðŸ‘ž #BRINGINGMORITOPLACES #tslbojio (stay tuned for more coming up while we stay home)
