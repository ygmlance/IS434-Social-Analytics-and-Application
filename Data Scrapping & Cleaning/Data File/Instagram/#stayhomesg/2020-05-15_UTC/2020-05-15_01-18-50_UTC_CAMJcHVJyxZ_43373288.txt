Welcome the weekend with Mae, a wellness consultant at @maselifestyle—in today’s #MadeByShentonistas episode, she will be introducing you to the art of sound healing. Known to provide moments of emotional and mental clarity, singing bowls are often used in sound healing to reduce negative emotions and restore one’s energy through the sound vibrations. 
Plug in your earphones for the best experience!
