🙏🏼A huge kam xia to our sup-pork-ters for allowing our Pork to be with you during this period 😂

Today marks the end of the second week... of the second month of CB for us at CCB 😆 No doubt it has been a challenge but we are proud to say that WTH delivery has served over hundreds of customers 👏🏼 and never once did we reject any orders or were unable to fulfill them after confirmation

Yes, there may be a delay in sending out confirmation text 😔 but we seek your kind understanding that we sometimes are caught up at the stall or taking a short tiny break 🍽

If you are able to submit an order through our online delivery / pickup form with all information given correctly, we will definitely reach out to you before 11 pm to secure the orders! So don’t worry! 😎

Thank you for the countless good reviews on our food, services, delivery timing and etc! Keep them coming as we continue to serve and cook ‘em porking good food, providing our customers with the best quality of our pork-alicious meal 💪🏼
