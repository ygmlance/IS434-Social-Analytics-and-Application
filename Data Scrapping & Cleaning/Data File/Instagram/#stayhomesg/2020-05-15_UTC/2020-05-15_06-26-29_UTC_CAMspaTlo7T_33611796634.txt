They say money cant buy you happiness but it sure as hell can buy you delivery at the time you want. If you are unable to wait for the food during the given time frame and would like to have the food delivered to you at a particular time , e.g. 12pm/ 6.00pm , you can simply TOP-UP additional $5 to the delivery charge  to opt for  it. That brings a total of $13 for delivery.  Kindly let us know when you're placing the food order , so necessary arrangements can be made. .

Kindly also let us know if the meals need to be consumed early due to medical requirements when placing orders and NOT ON THE DAY OF DELIVERY,  so that we can make sure the food Is delivered on time.  Help us to serve you better . .
