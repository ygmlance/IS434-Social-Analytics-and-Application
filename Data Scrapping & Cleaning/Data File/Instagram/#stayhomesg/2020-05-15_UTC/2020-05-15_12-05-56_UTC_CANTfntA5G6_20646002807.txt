Taiwan Braised Pork Noodles w Ramen Egg ðŸ¥š 
Deliciously sweet braised pork belly with chinese ramen (White Jade Noodles). .

Hack 1: Remember the soya chicken you cooked which left you with lots of braising liquid? Boil some eggs and keep them in the liquid before putting them away in the fridge. The eggs become these soft delicious  ramen eggs after a few days. Anytime you need a ramen egg for some noodles, they are ready in the fridge. You can keep recycling this sauce and putting eggs in them till your kids get married and present it as your family heirloom. .
Hack 2: The same braising liquid can be used for this dish and so I tend to plan my braised pork dishes days/week after my soya chicken dish. Itâ€™s the sauce that keeps giving!

Method: (Serves 5-6 pax)
ðŸ¥¢ Cut 800g pork belly into small pieces. Fry till pork is brown and slightly dry. ðŸ¥¢ Add diced shallots. Fry. Add minced garlic (2 tbsp). Fry. Add dried mushrooms (8-10 soaked and cut into small pieces). Fry. Supposed to add 1 tsp 5 spice powder (but I didnâ€™t because I was going to use my braising liquid which had star anise and cinnamon). ðŸ¥¢Add 1 cup sake or Chinese rice wine. Boil. Add 800 ml of the braising liquid. Add 7 pieces of rock sugar. Boil. Then cover w lid and simmer for 45 mins to an hour. Serve w egg, veg, rice/noodles.
