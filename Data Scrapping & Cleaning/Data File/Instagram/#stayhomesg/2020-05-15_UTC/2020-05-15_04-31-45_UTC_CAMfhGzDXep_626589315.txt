[Lessons from Biodiversity] Going solo⁣
⁣
#DidYouKnow that not all bees live in hives? Solitary bees like this Broad-headed Leafcutter (Megachile laticeps) live alone or in small groups. As its name suggests, the female leafcutter bee uses its jaws to cut out leaf discs to nest its offspring. It searches for suitable nesting sites, gathers nesting material, and forages all by itself.⁣

For these solitary animals, going solo is a way of life. Swipe left to check out some other native solitary animals, like the Malayan Colugo and Buffy Fish Owl! Like them, let’s stay safe during this period by going out alone for essential needs and exercising alone.⁣
