Thank God, Ah gong (my papa) is back home from hospital. 
Jesus, please have mercy with him and let him dwell in Your words, and forget about his past and be a new creation, and gives glory to You, the only God. 
Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” Luke 15:10 NKJV

Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he  is  a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
II Corinthians 5:17‭-‬19 NKJV
