#1to1
With my no.1. His time with me? Was to get me to play Brawl stars with him! And I agreed despite my reluctance.😅 I'm really no gamer. I'd rsther read a book or paint or cook or rum than play game on a device. From a 'aiyoh, i didn't know teaching mummy would be so difficult' to ' wow, mummy you are actually not bad' because i helped him win 4 games together Hhahaha.
Always a first time! Am pretty proud of myself for learning to grow together with him. It was a short 20mins game then we did coding. Again, i was learning from him! This code.org- then go to codestudio, is pretty interesting!
