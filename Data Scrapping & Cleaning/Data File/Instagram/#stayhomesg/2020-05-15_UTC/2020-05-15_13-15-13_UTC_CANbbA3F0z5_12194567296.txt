I love weddings and so I challenged myself to shoot these wedding-style item detail shots at home, solely in my own room. I used my Canon FD 50mm f1.4 lens with my Sony A7ii to shoot this entire series over a Monday afternoon and it was a really nice way to practice shooting something that isn't humans!
