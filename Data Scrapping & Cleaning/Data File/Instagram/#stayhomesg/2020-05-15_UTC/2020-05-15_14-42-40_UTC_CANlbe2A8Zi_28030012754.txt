Other ways of exfoliating can be perform mechanically by using abrasive scrub or by doing chemical facials. 
These are harmful as it rips off our skin’s  natural protection. 🍅Ellure bubble mask is a gentle way to cleanse, exfoliate and hydrate your face. It uses a special oxygenating to deep cleanse our face and when the foaming when applied is similar as getting a oxygen facial.
