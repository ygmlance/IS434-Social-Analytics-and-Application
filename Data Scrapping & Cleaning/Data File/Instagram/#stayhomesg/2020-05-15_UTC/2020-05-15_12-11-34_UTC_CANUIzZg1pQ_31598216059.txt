chocolate coossant (croissant cookies) aka the by-product of my croissant trimmings 🥐🍪🍫
.
lately I've been obsessed with making croissants, all thanks to my mom's "simple" mothers day request for croissants (which I couldn't deliver on time 😂)
.
3 trials later and my croissants are still no where near that honeycomb crumb I'm after 🙈 but I'm telling myself it's okay, baby steps and with that much butter...even the failed ones can't taste that bad, right? 😅
.
however, I'm surprised by how much I like this odd little creation...its crisp on the outside and soft on the inside AND less doughy than my brioche-ssants 😂
.
will be reflecting on #lessonslearnt in croissant making soon!
.
how do you like to use your croissant trimmings? 🤤
