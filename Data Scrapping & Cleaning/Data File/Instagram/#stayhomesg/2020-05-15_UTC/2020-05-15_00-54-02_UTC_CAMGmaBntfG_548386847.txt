Good news for fans of @goldleafsingapore , as they are back to serve you with the best of comfort food! Think classic braised Pork belly, Fluffy omelette with chye poh, savory steam pork with salted eggs, XO prawns and more! These dishes have always been their staple and no matter how many times I’ve eaten them, they are still as good! Even when delivered to you, the standard is still there!
🔻
@goldleafsingapore now offers island wide delivery at just $10 so do call 6346 1088  to place your orders! Pick up is also available and for those who owns a transport, I would gladly encourage you guys to place your order and head on down and just pick up your food at the lobby! You need not even park your vehicle!
