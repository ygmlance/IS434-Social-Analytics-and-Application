There’s no better medicine than prevention.

While we press on in our fight against COVID-19, let’s stand with our frontline warriors by taking responsibility over our safety, and protect our loved ones by protecting ourselves.

Wear a mask when heading out for essentials, avoid crowded areas, and maintain good personal hygiene.

We’re all in this together.
