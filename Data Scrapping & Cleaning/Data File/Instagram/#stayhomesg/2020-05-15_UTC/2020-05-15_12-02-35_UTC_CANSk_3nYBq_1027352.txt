Besides ready-to-eat meals, @level33_sg has a selection of individual Meal Kits for takeaway too. Each of these is a balanced nourishing set with fully prepped ingredients, which means theyâ€™ve been washed, portioned and perfectly seasoned. Clear instructions are included to help you put together a restaurant-quality meal in under 20mins. Me and my itchy backside opted for this when @gastrosense emailed to say they wanted to send a #Level33 meal to me and my family. I chose the Black Garlic Carbonara Pasta ($13+) for us because after gawking at @casanostrasgâ€™s Antonioâ€™s #PastaPorn lessons (beautifully filmed by his wife @ingology), I was seduced into thinking even I could try my hand at a #carbonara.
Granted the Meal Kit was a bit of a cheat ðŸ˜† and I had a little help. But it was easy and fun to follow the step-by-step guide that led to the plate-up mere minutes later. There wasnâ€™t even a need to turn on the stove since I used a kettle to boil water for the pasta.
I think the result was very flavourful, due in part to the almost alcoholic sweetness of the black garlic and the rich bacon oil (slightly unconventional carbonara ingredients but shhhhh....). However, in my #noobness, I think I left the pasta languishing a little too long in the hot water and thus, it was soft rather than al dente. Oops.
If you arenâ€™t into a heavy carb, fret not. Several other Meal Kit choices await at the link in @level33_sgâ€™s bio. Vegetarian ones too.
Donâ€™t hold back from picking up a few bottles of their craft beers either - the Blonde Lager and India Pale Ale seem to be a hit with most ($6.50+). #veronicaphuaeats #level33 #pasta #microbrewerysg #burpproved #burppletastemaker #burpple #sgfoodies #igfood #igfoodie #instaeat #foodiesofinstagram #foodlover #foodstagram #foodie #foodspotting #tastespotting #foodporn #singapore #homecooked #stayhomesg #loveyourlocalsg #savefnbsg #savelocalbreweries
