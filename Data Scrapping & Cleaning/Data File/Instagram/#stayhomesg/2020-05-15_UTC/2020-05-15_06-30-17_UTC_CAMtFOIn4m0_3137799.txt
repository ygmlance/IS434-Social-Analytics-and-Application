This one has been following me into the kitchen. She debut her first Chinese dishes last night and made pizzas using prata pastry for lunch today.
.
Although it can be sometimes stressful for me to make sure she doesn't scald or cut herself, I am really proud of #phoebefoong for being focused and courageous. She was very happy when garnishing the dishes finally and presenting them before the family. ðŸ’–

Later, both kiddos will be learning how to make wantons! Let's see how it goes! ðŸ˜‚
