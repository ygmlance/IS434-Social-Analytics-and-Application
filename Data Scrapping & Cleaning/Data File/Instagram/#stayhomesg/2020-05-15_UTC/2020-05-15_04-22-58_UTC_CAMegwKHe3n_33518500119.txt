Happy TGIF! Where can we travel now except to the kitchen for some guilt-inducing snacks? 
Perhaps we can try a taking 1 minute travel with our mind? Take a deep breath and imagine that you are going through Doraemonâ€™s magical door to somewhere exciting, lovely and free of covid-19! 
1 minute to imagine beautiful thoughts can help us feel lighter and more at peace. Our powerful minds and imagination can get us any where we want, as long as we command it! Where are you going with your mind today? .
