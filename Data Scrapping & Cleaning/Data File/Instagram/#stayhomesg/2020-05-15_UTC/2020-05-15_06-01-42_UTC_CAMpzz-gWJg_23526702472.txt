We do work on residential projects, even as we mainly focus on single client homes. An early apartment project we completed was One Robin, a boutique development of 14 units located in Central Singapore.

We designed the Arclinea kitchen to create a compact and efficient workspace within a 12sqm space, and in line with the architectural building design of having space and light. Stay tuned for more photos of this project in the upcoming posts.
