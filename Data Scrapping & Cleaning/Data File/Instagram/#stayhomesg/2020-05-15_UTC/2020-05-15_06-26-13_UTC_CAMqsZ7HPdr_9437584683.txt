This soulful rendition of "Home" performed separately at different locations but tuned to perfect timing by our school social work team Ms Charmaine and Mr Adrian. Did any of you also realise something interesting in the background of the video? Comment if you do! Let's keep going strong as we enter into the final couple of weeks to the circuit breaker. To all our children and youths, stay safe and well!
