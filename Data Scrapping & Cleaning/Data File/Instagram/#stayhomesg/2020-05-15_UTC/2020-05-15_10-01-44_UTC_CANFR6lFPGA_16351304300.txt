Hi, my name is Matthias. Pantler was founded by my partner, Head Chef Tomoharu Morita and I. He was part of an award-winning pastry team at Grand Hyatt Tokyo. I met him while doing an apprenticeship there in the bakery department. We also previously worked together at Joel Robuchon Singapore. 
It is every chef’s dream to have a space to call their own. Hence, we decided to work together to create this concept that embodies everything we think a bakery and pastry shop should be. Thus, Pantler, which provides freshly baked goods, exquisitely made pastries and cakes, great coffee in a modern and comfortable setting with good music and friendly staff was born. 
COVID-19 has greatly impacted our business and how F&B businesses are runned altogether. For Pantler, we’ve had to deal with the drastic decline in sales as offices around us shifted to implement work-from-home policies. We’ve changed to be more reliant online orders and delivery services. We miss being able to interact with our customers and friends. 
That said, if you would like to give Pantler a try, here are my recommendations — Crème Caramel and Black Forest. I think we do an amazingly delicate rendition. 
Pantler is open for takeaways and island-wide delivery.
