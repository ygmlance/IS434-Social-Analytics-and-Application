🥑🍅TGIF! Pairing your food right can make a great difference to your diet!

For instance, avocados and tomatoes is a total A TEAM when eaten together

Nutrients in tomatoes, like cancer-fighting lycopene, aren’t readily absorbed unless paired with fat, and Avocado that contains monounsaturated fats helps complete the magic!
These two ingredients also happen to taste phenomenal together in tons of different recipes!

Here's one of my favorite!

Mix this 2 superfood together, splash some lemon, sprinkle some pepper and salt. Dip in with some corn chips.

Yummm, here goes a perfect snack 😋
