We are halfway through the school holidays and hope that you are enjoying your time!

What type of Holiday Student have you been this holidays?! Are you the smart bookworm; the gamer; or the snacker who can’t stop peeking into the fridge every now and then?

Whichever you are, we hope that you can set aside some time for your revision! School’s about to begin again in 2 weeks! Get your engines running and strive for the better! Most importantly, stay home and stay healthy!
