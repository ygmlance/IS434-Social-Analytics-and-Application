Another weekend is here, and we are getting closer to the goal… getting out of this circuit breaker! We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.

Over the past weeks, we have received many comments from friends and family, and sometimes random customers on social media, about our food.

Thankfully, most of them have been really encouraging. Our team works really hard, and we try our best everyday to make everything from scratch, and everything from the heart.

We like to celebrate small victories, so here’s a medley of some of the nice comments we have seen, and the food in question…

Just remember, we’re open everyday for lunch and dinner, and there’s FREE DELIVERY ISLANDWIDE for orders $50 and above.
