Because we can't travel for a while, decided to bring Brighton Beach indoors. The Grimms wave stacker is from the Large 4 Elements, a wonderful set for small world play or just stacking. Also just realised the #grimmsrainbowfriends look like they're wearing bathing caps ðŸ¤£ And love the little Lola pieces from #grapat floating in the sea. Everything about the set is wonderful!

It has been a tiring few weeks, and the play base and houses arrived just in time for a hide-from-toddler-to-paint vacation!
