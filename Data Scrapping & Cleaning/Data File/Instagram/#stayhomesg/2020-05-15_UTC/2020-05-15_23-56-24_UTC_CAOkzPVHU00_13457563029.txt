Do you see that tiny little bun in the bottom left of the bread pan? 🍞 Well, my little girl pushed it in just before I sent the dough into the oven!
.
She really enjoys spending time together with me while I bake. And on days I want to complete the recipe on my own, I’ll give her a part of my dough so she can have fun kneading while I got busy. I’ll usually allow her to cook whatever she has prepared.
.
🌿The surprise is in discovering how her creation tastes like - tasty or not, that’s secondary! Because, #honoureveryeffort 🥰.
.
🌿Filling our home with the aroma of fresh bread is one of the most delightful ways to welcome our day!

Swipe ⬅️ to see the rose-shaped pumpkin buns we made last week. That’s right before we sent them into the steamer. 😋 These were really yummy and fluffy - like how you’d expect when you sink your teeth into a good ol’ 馒头.

Recipe in the link in my bio. I’ll keep it there till the end of May.

🕊Have a lovely Saturday!
