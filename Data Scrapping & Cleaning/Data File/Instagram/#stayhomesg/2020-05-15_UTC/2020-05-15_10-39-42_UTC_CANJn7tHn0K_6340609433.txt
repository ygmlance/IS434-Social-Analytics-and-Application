Goreng Pisang, 3 for $5 from 𝐊𝐞𝐞’𝐬 𝐂𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐩𝐲 𝐆𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐧𝐠!⠀
⠀
While we were queuing and waiting for our food at next stalls (Fried Hokkien Mee & Chicken Rice)... the pipping hot, freshly fried up from wok Goreng Pisang caught our attention! It’s slightly bigger than the usual mini kind thus it’s slightly more ex. The batter is 💯 crispy, not too salty and the banana in it is very sweet 🍌 and soft. Yummy n shiok! ⠀
