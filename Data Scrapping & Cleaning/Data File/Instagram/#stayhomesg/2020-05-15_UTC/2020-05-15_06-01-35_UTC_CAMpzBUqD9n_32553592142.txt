BACK & ABS 💪🏻🔥⠀
•⠀
•⠀
I got a lot of requests to do a Back workout that can be done at home.  You can’t neglect the posterior chain (backside).⠀
This is a great Back and Core workout that you can do in your home, all you need is a single resistance band.  This workout will help strengthen and tone your back, also improve posture.⠀
Increasing the resistance of the band will make each movement that much harder.  Try and go for 15-20 reps of each movement 💪🏻⠀
•⠀
•⠀
3-4 rounds of each Set / 15-20 reps of each exercise / Rest for 60-90 seconds between each round •⠀
