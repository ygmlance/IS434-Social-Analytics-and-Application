Filthy Friday strikes again

Nowadays, when people say TGIF, I dread a little. Because @crossfitmobilus  has planned a Filthy Friday workout. But I know I would have cut myself so much more slack if I hadn't attended the session.

Indeed, I ended the session knowing I've had a great workout. With @stuartdiplock encouragement and @richmondloo shouting at me.

Thanks for keeping me accountable!
