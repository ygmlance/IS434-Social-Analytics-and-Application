Have you heard? Our cakes are back! Yes, you read that right. Itâ€™s been quite a while since we have any cakes at our outlets and we know many of you have been asking about our cakes. Our bakers have been busy restocking them these few days and now our sliced cakes are available for delivery or takeaway from our outlets. For those who have missed our cakes, be sure to order your favourites via GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo. Island-wide delivery is also available with minimum order of $25. Tap link in bio to order.
