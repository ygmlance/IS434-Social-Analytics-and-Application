Cooking more during the Circuit Breaker? Doing more frequent grocery runs but not sure what's best to purchase?

Before you reach out for canned food, instant noodles, chips and sweets, look out for foods to bolster your immunity! Fresh vegetables and fruits are densely packed with nutrients and vitamins, while whole grains like brown rice, oats and quinoa are high in fibre and vitamins compared to refined carbohydrates like white rice! Don't forget to use less salt, oil and sugar in your cooking! At Makan Mate, your healthier choice caterer, it's what we live by!
