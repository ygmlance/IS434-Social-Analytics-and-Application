[ 15 May 2020 // Day 39 of Circuit Breaker ] These photos were captured over the past few days.. Other than guiding the kids in their usual academic work, I’ve also now become a piano and art teacher to them 😳🥵. I’m just winging it and honestly, I’m crossing my fingers that my kids are benefiting (or even learning) from my guidance.🤞🏼

Today has been another tough day with the kids, there were screams and tears from each one of them. I was so physically and mentally drained from my kids that I stormed out of the house and bought for myself an upsize Big Mac MacDonald’s meal, even after I had dinner 🍔🍟🥤. I won’t lie, it felt good to eat my negative feelings away. I love my kids to death, but sometimes they really drive me up the wall 🤯. They’re as different as rock, paper and scissors, and it’s exhausting to parent them every day. Kids can be angels and devils simultaneously. They can be truthful and amazingly dishonest. They can be loving one minute and hateful the next. Kids are totally unpredictable and parenting is truly one profession that no one is trained or prepared for 🥵. So if you see any mom or dad who has gained weight during the CB period, just think of all the stress and terror they’ve experienced with their children at home 24/7, and be a little kind in your comments to them. 😭🙏🏻

Nonetheless among the chaos at home, I can’t imagine life without my kids 🥺. Yes they’re emotionally taxing, but yet, they’re emotionally rewarding too. They make me grow, challenge me, and change me in so many ways ❤️. Without my kids, I’ll probably be a couch potato without a clear purpose in life.. So yes, tomorrow will be another challenging day with my kids, but I wouldn’t change that for anything in the world. 🙏🏻✨
