When I first started transitioning into a #zerowastebeauty routine, one of the easiest product to give up is my usual drugstore toner. You can easily make your own toner out of the ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen. This is how I make my favourite toner :

1. Wash and rinse any choice of your rice (3tbsp) for 3 times. I prefer jasmine rice because it gives my toner a nice hint of jasmine scent.

2. Add 1 tbsp of green tea leaves to your washed rice.

3. Add 1 cup of room temperature water to the mixture, stir and cover with lid. Leave it overnight. You can add more or less water depending on the toner concentration that you want to achieve.

4. Strain and store the liquid in any reusable bottle you have. Keep it in the fridge for up to 2weeks.
