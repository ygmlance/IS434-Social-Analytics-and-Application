Home alone in the evening means treating myself to a quick and comforting mealüòå Decided to make oyakodon for dinner, a dish that is pretty easy to prepare.

Ingredients used were chicken, onions, 2 eggs and green onions. To make the sauce, combine dashi or chicken stock, soy sauce and mirin in the ratio 5:1:1. That's about 1.5 tbsp each for soy sauce and mirin. With this sauce, you can make other dishes like katsudon and gyudon too!üôåüèª

Bring the mixture to boil then simmer on medium heat for a few minutes. Add onions and cook till soft, lower the heat. Add chicken that has been cooked beforehand and simmer for a few seconds. Drizzle lightly beaten eggs over and cook till they are almost settled yet runny. Finally, top off with green onions and serve the rice bowl with miso soupü§§
