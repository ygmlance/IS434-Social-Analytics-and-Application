I came across this quote in Pinterest and i feel this is a reminder for me daily to find the beauty in everyday.

During CB all of us could not go out for leisure but the good is families spend time with each other more. 
Many of us have level up our cooking skills and became good cooks and bakers too. 
Learning how to use new digital/virtual programs. Attending lots of virtual trainings which we never had done before. 
Unknowingly we have learn alot new things during CB time. 
Now I have Learn to focus on the good and the good gets better. 
_Happy mind Happy Life_
