Day 39 of Circuit breaker.
#jasmine_kitty_kitchen is still open.ðŸ˜„
Use back all the same ingredients as yesterday.
Same same but different.
Today i chopped up the luncheon meat and added Japanese chilli powder to stirred fried  cook a scramble egg. 
Like yesterday,  just stack the ingredients with lettuces. 
Today i cut the bread into small triangles shapes.
And just used cute Hello kitty picks to secure it.
