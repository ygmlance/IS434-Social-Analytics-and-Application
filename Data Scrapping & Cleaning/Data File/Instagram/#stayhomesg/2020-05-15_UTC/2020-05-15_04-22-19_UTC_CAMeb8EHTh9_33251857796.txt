Hello from the other side, my #deliveryheroes 🌈  Thank you all for keeping us going & safe with contact-less deliveries 💪🏻 .

It's already mid-May!! You know its that time of the month where all credit card promo codes for the food deliveries get maxed out 😥 .

SmartyPence Tip 💡
Thankfully for us, @foodpandasg is celebrating its 8th Birthday. Use code 8BDAY to get 8% off on both food deliveries & PandaNow! (min $15 spend). Have you guys tried PandaNow? Its been a lifesaver for us - order fresh milk, eggs & flour(!!) with ZERO delivery fees & min spend of $5 only while keeping us at home..what!?!?! .

I also found another active code for ALL food outlets in Capitaland Malls across ALL 3 FoodPanda, GrabFood & Deliveroo platforms!!!! Use CLMALL5 to get $5 off (min $20 spend)! I would say this is an amazing initiative for Capitaland to help boost it's tenants businesses.
.
Hang in there everyone, 2 more weeks and we might have to start crawling back to our offices 😁😳 #stayhomesg #sgcircuitbreaker #sgsavings #howtosave #FIRE #savings #foodpandasg #promocodessg
