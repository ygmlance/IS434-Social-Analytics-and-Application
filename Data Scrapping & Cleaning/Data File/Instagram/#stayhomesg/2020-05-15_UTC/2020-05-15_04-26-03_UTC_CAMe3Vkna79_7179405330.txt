on some days it gets extremely boring and lonely... but yes there are good things about this circuit breaker too ðŸ¥° for me, the silver lining of this circuit breaker is that iâ€™m able to rest and do whatever i want to do. most of the time, iâ€™ll make sure iâ€™m using my time wiselyâ€” whether its taking up a part time job or catching up with friends. it has been quite some time where i felt like i could just stay at home and binge watch netflix shows & youtube videos... and just be unproductive. not everyone gets to sit back and chill during this time, so i am truly thankful for this time of rest :-)
