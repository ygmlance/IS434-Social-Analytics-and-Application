#day37 #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg 3 years old behaving like a 13 years old

Woke up and wants to listen to songs on her headphone. She really loves song and listening to songs is one of an activity that she can focus better on. Haha

Role played again taking care of the baby. The way she took care of the baby really made me ponder whether I should give her a sister or brother 🤣🤣🤣🤣 but taking care of her alone is too exhausting wahahaha

Wanted to play bubble so we told her to play alone outside since we have to work. She agreed to my surprise and played for a little while 
Finally some bonding time with her after dinner so she chose some activities for us to play with her.
