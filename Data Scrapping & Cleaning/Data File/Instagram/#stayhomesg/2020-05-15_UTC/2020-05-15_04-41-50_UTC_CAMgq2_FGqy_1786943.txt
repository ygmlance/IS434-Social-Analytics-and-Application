Had some bibimmyeon sauce from @paldofood lying around the house so I thought I'd make some bibimmyeon! Didn't use the maggi noodles but used thin Soba noodles instead! ⁣
⁣
Mixed with julienned carrots and zucchini, boiled egg and a sprinkle of sesame seeds! ⁣
⁣
Paired with some stir fried pork and banchan (I love 오징어무침, the cuttlefish side dish!!)
