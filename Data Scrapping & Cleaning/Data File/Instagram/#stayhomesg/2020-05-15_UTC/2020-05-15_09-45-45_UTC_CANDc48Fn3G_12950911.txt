Today, Logan and I made these DELICIOUS beauties - Vegan carrot apple muffins!! There’s carrot, apple, banana and oats in it too. (I wish I had walnuts!) Perfect to have it for breakfast/snack! And maybe for lunch and dinner too! 😉 These were almost wiped out within a few hours by the 3 of us. ☺️

Thank you @minimalistbaker for this amazing recipe. It’s my all time fav muffin recipe that’s going to be on my monthly baking list! It’s that good!!
