Every day is a milestone.

Today, #RaymondRecommends #Kakushigoto!

You see, this is actually my 44th consecutive post. I've never been here, i.e. made SO MANY recommendations in a row. It's no secret I rate myself as a lobang ðŸ‘‘, but I do feel I outdo myself every day.

Good thing is, I don't think I'm about to run out of ideas as a 'digital curator' any time soon. Sure, there are dicey days like today; again, I'm cutting it close, still in the thick of writing to meet my self-imposed 2359 daily deadline.

So-called personal achievement aside, sharing lobangs has always been something positive and PRACTICALâ€”not my middle name, LOLâ€”I can do for my community, and by extension the world. I believe I've gained much experience and can only get better at it. Behind every lobang of mine is a flickering hope that some folks out there trust me and take my word, which must be worth...at least 2 cents? ðŸ¤£

I look forward to a break on 2 June. ðŸ¤²
