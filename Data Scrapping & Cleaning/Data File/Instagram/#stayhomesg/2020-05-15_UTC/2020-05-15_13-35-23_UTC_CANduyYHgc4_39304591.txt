So super excited for my cooking debut on @singaporehomecooks this Saturday 16 May at 8pm!! 👩🏻‍🍳 Please support and log on to www.facebook.com/singaporehomecooks to find out how to make this “30 minute One-Pot Chicken Rice”. 🐔 This is in support of my campaign to raise $20k for @foodfromtheheartsg a food charity in Singapore that provides groceries to low-income families who really need your help during these challenging times. 🥀To donate and receive a copy of my e-cookbook @smitteninthekitchen please click on the #linkinbio!! ♥️
