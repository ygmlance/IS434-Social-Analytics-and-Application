⭐Lucien is 8 months old today!⭐ This video was taken about 2 weeks ago, where he stood up on his own without me pulling him up! 👏
.
He was recently very ill with diarrhoea and lost a lot of weight, but he has since regained all the weight he lost! While he used to be very fussy during meals, Lucien has recently started enjoying his meals. We realised he likes veggies 🥕more than fruits which are sweet!
.
Lucien is not yet able to sit independently yet, however he is super impatient and wants to keep standing up. We figured that he has strong legs, but his core muscles need some catching up! 😁
