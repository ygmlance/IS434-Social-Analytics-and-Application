Total of 28 hours to make my second sourdoughs, using Hitachi Oven bread steaming function, and I don't even need to bake for another 15-20 min to make it brown as I feel it is already in the right shade. Continue baking might make my gum bleed again, as it will affect the crust. But I still think that the spring oven effect is not to my expectation though it has risen double in size. I feel it is relatively flat 🤷🏻‍♀️ but even much better than the first with no banneton and Dutch oven! 😆 #sourdough #sourdoughaddict #stayhomesg
