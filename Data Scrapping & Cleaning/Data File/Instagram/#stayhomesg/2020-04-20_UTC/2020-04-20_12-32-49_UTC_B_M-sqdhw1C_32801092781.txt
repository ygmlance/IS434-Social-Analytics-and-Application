Circuit breaker Day 14: Kith cafe’s pastas (no thumbs up 😅) Ordered from Kith for the 1-for-1 pasta, portions are huge (too much) and definitely, it’s nicer when you eat there. Pollo (cream sauce + avocado + spinach + chicken) got a bit jelak, while the Granchio (spicy crabmeat) was a tad dry and also used spaghetti, not linguine as stated in the menu 😪 Excited to try the multigrain bread for breakfast tomorrow though!
