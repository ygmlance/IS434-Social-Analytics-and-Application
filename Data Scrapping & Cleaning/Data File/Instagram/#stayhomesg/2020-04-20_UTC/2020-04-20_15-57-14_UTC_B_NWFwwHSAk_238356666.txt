Did a spontaneous IG Live on making 乾炒牛河 at home last week, and some of you asked afterwards whether I could do a recap.

There are many online recipes out there so I won’t be repeating that. But there are three essential tricks that I could share to allow everyone to make a good 乾炒牛河 at home:

1. The treatment of your beef: You don’t need a wagyu to make a good stir-fry. Buy your cheapest piece of chuck steak or round steak, make sure you slice it thin enough, then soak in water for a while before you dry it for marinating. Add an additional egg white into your regular marinate will soften your toughest price of meat. Take your time to marinate well (usually I use my hands to gently rub it into the meat). Keep the cooking time of your beef to the minimum (2 mins??). This cheapest cut of beef will still turn out to be amazing!

2. Be patient when you fry your kway teow/ rice noodles. Let your hot wok to do the trick, before you add in any other ingredients, just let your noodles sit in the hot wok for a sufficient time to make sure it starts breathing in the spirit of the wok! Let it sit in there until you could smell the nice fragrance of the rice noodles gradually coming up from the wok, with the noodles starting to brown (not from the soy sauce - browning before you add in any seasoning). Then the rest of the procedures follow. 
3. The white part of your spring onions is key. It is the green pasture for your beef.

Happy cooking at home everyone!
