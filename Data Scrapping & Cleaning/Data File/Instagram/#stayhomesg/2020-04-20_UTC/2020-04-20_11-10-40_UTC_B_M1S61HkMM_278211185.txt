I think ever since young ive always wanted to have a workbench. I grew up making lots of random stuffs. From an ironman arc reactor to a stool etc.. It took almost over a year to collect materials and to find time to built the workbench. Although most of the bench I've refurbished from an old workbench that i bought, there was still alot of work to be done to make it what i want. All of the materials ive used in this built were reclaimed/recycled wood. From the big planks which came from the garden below my block which they were renovating to some neighbor's bed frames which they threw out at the dumpster. Bulk collection area are fill with treasure "sometimes". There are still somethings I do not like about this workbench but it will work for now! Till then.. #woodworking #木工 #workbench #stayhomesg
