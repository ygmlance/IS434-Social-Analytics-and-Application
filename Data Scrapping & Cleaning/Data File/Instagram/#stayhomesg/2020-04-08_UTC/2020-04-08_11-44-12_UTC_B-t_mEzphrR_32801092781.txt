Circuit breaker Day 2: $4 wanton mee 👍👍👍 noodles were still springy after dabaoing, good portion for $4, charsiew was meaty & not sliced too thin, wantons were real good - there was pork shrimp & water chestnuts wow 🤩 Added the feel good factor by bringing my own dabao box!
📍Huang Kee wanton noodles (Compassvale Bow, near Buangkok)
