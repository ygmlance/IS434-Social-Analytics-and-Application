Circuit breaker Day 8: Din Tai Fung for lunch 👍 This  place needs no introduction, went there to dabao today because of their ongoing promo - but pls don’t go guys the queue is crazy. Best dish ordered: 
#1 Steamed vegetable & pork dumplings
#2 Fried rice with prawn & eggs 
The rest don’t even deserve a mention, honestly everything was cold like it’s been left out there for awhile 😅 DTF surely you can do better 😪
