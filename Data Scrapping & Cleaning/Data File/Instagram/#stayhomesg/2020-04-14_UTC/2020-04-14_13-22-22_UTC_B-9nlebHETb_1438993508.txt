Because @unapologeticallyamandakoh did such a cute challenge that I just HAD to join!

Okay also decided that this should be here to commemorate my 2nd consecutive day of coming back to my morning yoga practices! Tbh, I haven't been doing self practice for the longest time and I've really lost quite a bit of patience for self practices! Used to be able to complete Ashtanga home practices for an hour plus and stick with it daily - but now, even 40 min gets me restless 😱 this #circuitbreaker is truly a reflective one for me🙇‍♀️ Onward to more morning practices!🤩🤩🤩 #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg
