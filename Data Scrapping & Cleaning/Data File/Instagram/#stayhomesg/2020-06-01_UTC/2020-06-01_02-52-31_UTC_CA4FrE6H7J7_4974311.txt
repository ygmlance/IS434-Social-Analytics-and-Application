[29.05.20] Day 53 of #circuitbreaker:

My lil’ dragonlady turned 8! Pre-COVID days, her birthday means the start of the June holidays - plenty of options on where to go to celebrate in SG or overseas! This year, she had to make do with celebrating at home…just like everyone else. 
But it ain’t that bad cos.. She had her favourite McDonald’s fish burger to kick off her day. Then she got to play whatever she wants (having done all her homework the day before) without any time restriction! 
Birthday dinner was a lil’ grill party for her to have fun cooking her own food. To celebrate in circuit-breaker style, we got the extended family to join in the birthday cake ritual over Zoom. (Only sharing the bit of screen with our littlest 宝 here cos she’s SOOOOO CUTE clapping her hands in excitement!) #sgunited #stayhomeforsg #stayhome #stayhomesg #istayathome #sgparents #sgmoms #sgkids
