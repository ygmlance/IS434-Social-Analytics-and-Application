WKOSS Update 2nd Jun 2020

All WKOSS dojos and classes remain closed until further noticeÂ in line with the Singapore Governmentâ€™s plan for the gradual resumption of business activities in phases from 2 June 2020 after Circuit Breaker is lifted.

Letâ€™s all do our part to be socially responsible.
Wishing you all the best and stay safe and well till see you all back for training soon.
OSU!
