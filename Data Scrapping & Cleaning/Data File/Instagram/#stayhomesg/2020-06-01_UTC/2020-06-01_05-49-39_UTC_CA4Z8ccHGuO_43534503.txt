Educational toys from @milknplay.sg have been accompanying my girl this CB! On a daily basis (I mean it!), she will request that I play tic bug toe with her and I MUST let her win 🙄, unfair right? 😂

She also love playing with the  balance boat, but don’t really have the patience to keep on trying until she succeed 😅.

The buddy blocks (sea life) is her personal favourite though she only like to piece turtle rather than other sea creatures 🤷🏻‍♀️ I am glad she doesn’t get bored of the toys and have repeatedly play with them several times 👍🏻
