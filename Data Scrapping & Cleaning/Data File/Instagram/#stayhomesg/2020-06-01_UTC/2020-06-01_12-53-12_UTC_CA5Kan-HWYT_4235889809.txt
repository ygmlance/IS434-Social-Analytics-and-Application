A very happy birthday to our dearest @karboen! Thanks for being the mummy of the group and taking care of our little daughters and always entertaining us with your ahegaos and Tiktoks! We miss shooting with you so much and can't wait to do so after CB ends! To all who had to celebrate your birthdays at home without your friends, stay strong! The storm will be over soon! #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #circuitbreaker #sgunited #instasingapore #sglife #whatissingapore #sgfoodie #sgfoodlover #sgig #sginstagram #igsg #sginsta #sgdaily #sgstyle #sgphotography #ohanasingapore
