<Circuit Breaker>
7 April to 1 June 2020.
56 days.

In a year’s time, 10 or 20 years down the road, I will always  remember this Covid episode and Circuit Breaker. 
Heavily pregnant at 33 weeks when CB started to the upgraded status as Mom of 2!

Somehow, someway, I got through two months of staying at home with my firstborn (and now with a newborn in the last 2 weeks). For sure, I got to spend more time with little Carrick yet there were days when he really got me into my nerves. But I’ve survived. So perhaps, it’s a blessing in disguise if not for this Covid thingy and CB! I got to understand and learn more of him as he’s undergoing the “rebellious” toddlerhood. 
Before the plus one came, it was also a great time to step back to reflect and cherish the current blessings. So for that, I was thankful!

And now talking about the lifting of CB, I’m in a dilemma. To be honest, I wished it can be a little longer so I can enjoy the companionship of my 2 lovely sons. I wondered how I would feel when little Carrick returns to school next week.

Let’s give ourselves a pat on the shoulders as we have survived! Do continue to observe the safe distancing measures to stay safe and healthy!
