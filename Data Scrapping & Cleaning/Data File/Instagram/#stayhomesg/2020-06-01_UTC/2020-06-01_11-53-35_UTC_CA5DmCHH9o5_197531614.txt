1st Jun 20 - supposed to be in LA today in a parallel universe, but hey I got to spend 3 months in my new home where I learnt so much. I learnt a lot about content creation, that extroverts can be happy being introverts too (anybody?), that simple food deliveries on birthdays can mean so much, that if you want to make an effort maintain any relationships YOU CAN SIMPLY JUST ZOOM, and that korean dramas are so bloody amazing. .
.
And as a closure to CB, it was extremely heartening to see so many of you supporting our fundraising efforts for migrant workers over the past 2 weeks. ❤️ .
.
Hope everyone found their own way through this period, and that you’ve gained something too. If not, let’s make the best out of what’s about to come 😇 As for me, MORE CANTO CONTENT coming your way! 🙌
