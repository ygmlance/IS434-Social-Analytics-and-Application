Last day of Circuit Breaker here in Singapore and while that doesnâ€™t mean stores or restaurants are open it does mean the kids can go back to school for their last week. .

Celebrating the small victories where I can because there is so much hurt in the world right now. Also, trying to do my part to raise my kids to spread joy and love, to think before they speak, and to think through all the levels of their actions before they do them. Simple lessons really but sometimes simple things can bring great change. .
