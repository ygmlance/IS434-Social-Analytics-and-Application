Got some bonus 古早味糯米飯 from @loumirice_sg to replace the usual dinner carbs but oh boy, it stole the show with its aroma and intense flavor nurtured from the generous use of dried shrimps, shallots, mushrooms and pork belly 😋😋😋 Found our that the 糯米饭 is a family recipe of an auntie who has been whipping this for her family and decided to roll this out as @loumirice_sg with the help of her kids👍. Each box (good for 1-2pax) is priced affordably at $5 with a min. order of 2 boxes and islandwide delivery of $6 
P.s. it only operates on weekends now and preorders start every Monday •
