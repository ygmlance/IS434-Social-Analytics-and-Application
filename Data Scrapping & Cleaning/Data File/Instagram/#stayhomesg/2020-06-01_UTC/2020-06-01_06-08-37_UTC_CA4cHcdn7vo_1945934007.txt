Simple sewing 🧵 to add differentiation to the masks.

A dash of rainbow 🌈 colours added on for easier identification.

Not too loud but still stand out 😝

Sewed 2 of the reusable masks for Linnet to get ready to go back to school tomorrow so that she will not mixed up with the rest of her classmates when they removed them during their Physical Education lessons.  They are supposed to put them in a ziplock bag but kids may get mixed up too.
