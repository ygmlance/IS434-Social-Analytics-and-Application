Not exaggerating at all when I say this is the softest #MuahChee I have ever eaten.
The simple prep requires the big block of sticky rice cake to be cut into bite-sized pieces, then gently tossed in the sweetened ground #peanut with sesame seeds (this intensely fragrant mixture comes in a separate bag) until every piece is evenly coated. 
My mum-in-law who’s been deprived of her “muah chee” fix since the start of #CircuitBreaker couldn’t stop herself from inhaling it.
To be frank, I don’t usually seek out this traditional snack/dessert for myself which is why I am slightly taken aback at how much I enjoyed @tiaptiapwithsoph’s super-soft and squishy version. I’ve told her it is my favourite amongst the food items she had kindly sent me but I assure you, it was a close fight because the others were really tasty too.
Please don’t hesitate to DM her if you would like to order her homecooked goodies.
