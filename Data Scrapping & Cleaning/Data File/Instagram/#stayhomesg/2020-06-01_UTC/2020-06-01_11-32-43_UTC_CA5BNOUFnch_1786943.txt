I love bread! I love visiting bakeries when I'm overseas as well! My friend @vampireshan decided to send me these amazing bakes from @enjoue.bakery haha THANKS FRIEND! ⁣

These came as a surprise because there was no name! But I had a great time making stuff with the loaves of bread! Thought it would be difficult to finish so much bread but turns out it wasn't that difficult a task! ⁣

Really enjoyed the breads, next time I'll probably want to try their bagels and duo coloured croissants!
