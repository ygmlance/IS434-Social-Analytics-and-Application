Circuit breaker day 56.
Heavy rain earlier on.
Chicken porridge for today.
Didn't add too much other ingredients to it.
Only beancurd sheets,  tomatoes and carrots.
I want the taste of original chicken soup. No msg or any other seasoning here.
Eat with one Lup Chong Fried egg with Lettuces.
雨天吃鸡粥是最好不过的。鲜鸡肉熬的鸡汤，不加味精，加了萝卜🥕，番茄🍅，很鲜甜。
在炒一个腊肠蛋加生菜。
简单晚餐搞定。
