Today lunch @yakunkayatoastsg 
We all know that Ya Kun was famous for their traditional kaya toast. I have craving for mee siam today so I thought of giving ya kun mee siam a try and never regret it, itâ€™s delicious. We usually order their Kaya butter toast but today tried their Smokey cheese toast instead and itâ€™s good too ðŸ˜„
My husband tried their nasi lemak and he said itâ€™s yummy.
Our tummy is happy ðŸ˜†
