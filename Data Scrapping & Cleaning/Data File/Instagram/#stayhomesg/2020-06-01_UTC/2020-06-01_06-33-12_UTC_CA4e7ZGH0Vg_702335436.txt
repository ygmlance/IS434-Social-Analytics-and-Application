The Tower of Hercules. A Coruna, Spain. Apr'16

The Tower of Hercules, located in the Galicia region in northwestern Spain, is actually a 2000 year old lighthouse that looks out to the Atlantic Ocean. This makes it the oldest surviving lighthouse in the world today that is still in use.

Originally built by the Romans, the 55 metre high tower was reinforced in the 18th century to its present structure. Its name refers to the mythical hero Hercules, who was said to have completed his tenth task here, by recovering cattle from the three-headed giant Geryon, who he defeated and slew.

Today the tower is just on the outskirts of the city of A Coruna, and can be climbed for a perfect view of the city and surrounding coastline. It was cold and clammy weather when I visited, with a light drizzle, but that meant we had the place to ourselves with hardly any other visitors. The park around the tower is worth visiting too, with contemporary sculptures, including a club wielding life sized statue of Hercules that greeted me at the Visitor's Centre.
