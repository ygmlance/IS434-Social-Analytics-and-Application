Second attempt at Growing Taugeh: 21st April. In search of growing neater beansprouts. Verdict: Accepted though still skinny beansprouts. Harvested as before, before the end of 3rd day in germination! Fast!😁🌱 #growingbeansprouts #taugeh #beansprouts #stayhomesg #hdbgardening #indoorgardening #singaporeanyhow
