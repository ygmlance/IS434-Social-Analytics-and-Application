[31.05.20] Day 55 of #circuitbreaker:

While many of my friends transformed into amazing domestic goddesses in the kitchen during the circuit breaker period, I stopped cooking entirely! For one, I was avoiding the cleaning. Secondly, with the husband around..我是无用武之地了. 😉

So I picked up something new instead! With the soft pastels tool kit received from the @fabercastellsg event I attended some time ago, I joined @artpeacesg’s online workshops to further explore Nagomi art. One thing led to another..soon, I was practising with this medium through the regular workshops and charity drive workshops Audrey and her team of instructors organised. 
I may not be churning out yummy food from the kitchen but I can come up with some food with soft pastels now too..thanks to the Paint for a Cause charity workshops themed “Our Food Story”! Once again, I would like to express my appreciation to the instructors for their generosity in sharing their skills (which is a source of income for them) - keeping us meaningfully occupied, and giving us opportunity to give back to the needy through the charity drives.
