Last day of CB, and what better way to end it with some meaningful learning for lil jae! It has been a fruitful CB for us and am glad to have spent some time doing some topic studies with lil jae. We were "stuck" on Japan for the past weeks as mummy preps for a new school term. 
Introduced lil jae to HAIKU ~ a form of Japanese poetry! it's such a simple yet interesting way for lil ones to early poetry. As with always, @jae.explorer LOVES his food....even his haiku is about food!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Hope that even with the new super busy term starting tmr, we would still be able to find time to continue with our topic study themes!
