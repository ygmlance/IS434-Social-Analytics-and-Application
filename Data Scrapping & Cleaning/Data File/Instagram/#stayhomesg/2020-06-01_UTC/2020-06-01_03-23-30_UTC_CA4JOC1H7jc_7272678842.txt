We are finally in june!! We are in a crazy period right now with everything going on in the world, not only covid. Its very sad to wake up to news of innocent people dying,  and seeing how people with power are dealing with it. We all need to start loving each other better and be kind to one another. Everyone is just trying to get by in this world, there really isnt a need for such hatred towards another person..im not even talking about america only, im talking about the entire world, including singapore. It doesnt always have to lead to death for something to be deemed as serious. Theres this quote i live by - you never know what someone is going through, be kind. Always. - which i think is very true, you could be the cause of someoneâ€™s breaking point and its very scary to know that. 
Why bully when you can love and make more friends and possibly SAVE someone? Anyway i can keep going on about this topic cos i really have so much to say but i shanâ€™t bore you with my rants ðŸ˜‚ so please just stay safe and be kind to one another, we all need a little support especially during this pandemic.
