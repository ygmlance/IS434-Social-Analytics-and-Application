[01.06.20] Day 56 of #circuitbreaker:

Last day of circuit breaker! School reopens tomorrow. The kids are having HBL this week but we can’t sleep in because the teachers want to Google meet them at 730am! 
New normal awaits. Let’s do this! 🤜🏻🤛🏻 #sgunited #stayhomeforsg #stayhome #stayhomesg #istayathome #sgparents #sgmoms #sgkids
