In May, we had the privilege to host virtual bake-offs for some corporate clients.
.
Our #thelittlebakingkit (s) were sent all over the island to each participant’s home!
.
Drop us a dm or email us to enquire - Virtual Birthday Parties 🥳 , Corporate Parent-child bonding 👨‍👩‍👧, or even Group playdates! We will love to be part of your event!
.
Here’s to more virtual bake-offs as we wait in anticipation to resume physical classes back in our studio with all little 👩🏻‍🍳 👨🏻‍🍳s!
