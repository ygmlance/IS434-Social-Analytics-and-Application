Found another LED light in the house and replaced the shorter one. It’s a joy watching the spring onion grow and harvesting some leaves for my cooking. (Btw, my coriander died out on me twice already. Didn’t help even when I grew them in water first. Will try again when I buy some for my cooking) #hdbgardening #hdbbalconygarden #balconygarden #stayhomesg #growlight #seedlings #eggshell #springonion #daunbawang
