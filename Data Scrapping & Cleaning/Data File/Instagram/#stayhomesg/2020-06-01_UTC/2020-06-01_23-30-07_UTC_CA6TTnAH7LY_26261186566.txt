Greeting to the Seven Churches

4 John to the seven churches that are in Asia:

Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, 5 and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.

To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood 6 and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. 7 Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.

8 “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.” ASK
- What does this passage tell you who Jesus Christ is and what He has done for us?
- What does this passage tell you about the Father?
- In verse 8, we have the Lord God speaking. What is He saying to you?
- In Daniel 7:13-14, we have a description of the Son of Man returning in triumph and glory. Is the truth of Christ’s return reflected in our daily living?

PONDER
What would the reaction be of all the tribes of the earth when Jesus’ returns? Why would they respond in such a way? How about you?

PRAY
What are some things you can give God glory concerning Jesus in this passage?

REFLECT
What is one significant lesson that the Word of God is speaking to you?
