B I R T H D A Y  M O N T H ♡ 
Always the first exciting month I look forward to every year and then ofcos there's December. It's an age old practice of mine to celebrate the entire month so yes, I will accept cakes, flowers, gifts and extra extra love throughout the month. LOL! 
This year its definitely going to be different but I'm not gonna compromise and accept a mundane birthday month. Wine is gonna be my Friday nights. Its phase 2 in the mid month so I'll have a micro mini house party with 5 darlings! #cantwaittoseeyouagain❤️ I'll do whatever to keep the celebrations going till the month ends like I always do.
