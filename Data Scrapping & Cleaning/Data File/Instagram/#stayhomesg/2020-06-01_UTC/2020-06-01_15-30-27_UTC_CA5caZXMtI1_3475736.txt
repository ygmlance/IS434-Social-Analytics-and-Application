After circuit breaker started, I had been craving for crab especially when I always cycle past @houseofseafoodsg in Punggol Settlement. Today I finally get to eat it since they are having free islandwide delivery.

I choose their Signature Crab Bee Hoon Set so Leodys can get to eat it. He is so excited to see crab and keep waiting to eat the crab. See the video on how I couldnâ€™t stop him from eating, pardon his ugly eating manner. 
The Crab Bee Hoon has springy bee hoon soaked in rich and flavoursome broth, the crab is sweet and firm. Their Crab Bee Hoon is more toward the creamy soup type so you can still drink the broth after finish the Bee Hoon. Very suitable for family to have it. 
The Bai Ling Ku Spinach also very awesome and with very generous among of gravy. Must try their Fu Rong Omelette with their Balachan chili. Yummy yummy.
