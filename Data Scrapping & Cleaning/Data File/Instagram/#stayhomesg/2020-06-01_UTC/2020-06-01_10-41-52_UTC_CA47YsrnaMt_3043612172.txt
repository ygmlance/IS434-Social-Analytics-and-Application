Circuit breaker day 56: A dish which we used to order when dining out ➡️ 3-eggs spinach. Is this your favourite too? 🥰

Decided to recreate this dish as I have not had it for quite awhile. 😋 And I do not like having cooked veg via delivery. 
It's last day of #circuitbreaker. Hurray to everyone as we have made it this far! 🤗
