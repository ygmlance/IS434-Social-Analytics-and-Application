This is a cake I haven’t done in awhile. When I first embarked on making this basque burnt cheesecake, I did a lot of research and tried my best to find the closest source the chef in Basque who created this cake. I then embarked on a taste journey, playing with different flavour profiles of sugars and varying amounts of salt. I love, love, love the idea of a molten centre, just like a slice of camembert cheese when you slice through it. Sounds delicious already. Moreover, many people add some flour into their cakes. There really isn’t a need to; the cheese holds up on its own very well. My version tastes somewhat like a salted caramel cheesecake. I loved it when I tasted it, and still love it now after I’ve tasted others.
