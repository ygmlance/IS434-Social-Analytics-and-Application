What actually comes to mind when I hear people say “inner beauty”. #moohehe 
I’ve been meaning to check out this stall after seeing many foodie friends rave about its kway chap. Somehow I only got to do so during Circuit Breaker via their delivery service. Haha. 
The sheets of kway are smooth and are accompanied by a lovely herbal broth scented with dang gui. The innards and other ingredients are well braised and robustly flavoured in a super aromatic lor that I’m sure would make porcine heaven sing. A piquant chilli dip with just enough punch from the trio of acid, garlic and heat complemented the innards beautifully. 
Top all that with very generous portions. So much to eat we had it again for lunch the next day. 🤣
