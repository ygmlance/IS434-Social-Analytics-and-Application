Couldn’t get to sleep. Insomnia got me. My mind started wandering again after a few drinks. The same vivid memory that got me a few weeks ago began to playback in my head yet again. The last time it resulted in the piece ‘Pure’. This is like the sequel. The Kecak & Fire Dance at Uluwatu, Bali. The smell of the kerosene fires lingering in the air. The hypnotic sounds and ritualistic performances depicting the epic Ramayana poem...All these on a stage atop the cliffs with the sounds of crashing waves. All these in the beauty and warmth of the majestic sun setting around us. I was totally absorbed and besotted by the experience. This temporary watercolor station at home is definitely going to be a permanent set-up for insomnia nights. Check out the deckled edges on the paper.  Decided to name this ‘Fire Dance’ for obvious reasons. Watercolour on Saunders Waterford Smooth HP Watercolour paper. 56cm x 76cm w.
