Thankyou @mymessybox for keeping my two 👩‍👧‍👦BUSY this weekend! We’ve literally started running out of things to do at home and turned to this sensory play activity kit by My Messy Box on Sunday. And guess what... with 3-4 activities in every subscription box, this one’s a real Circuit Breaker winner for us mamas!🙌😅
What I loved about our Messy Box:
✔️Well thought through ideas💡 that promote motor and cognitive skills
✔️Designed by Early Childhood Certified Teachers
✔️Hassle-free subscription services that send you a box every month💆🏼‍♀️!
✔️Different themes for different age groups means they can all stay happy and engaged! This box was meant for older kids but both of mine found ways to play with it regardless... ofcourse until the fighting begun🤣
✔️Easy but educational themes: We’ve been reading ‘The Very Hungry Caterpillar’ to Neev these days and the lifecycle of a butterfly really came alive with this kit. Absolutely loved the colorful pasta, butterfly art activity and those trainer chopsticks - we can’t wait to try them on actual food soon!
