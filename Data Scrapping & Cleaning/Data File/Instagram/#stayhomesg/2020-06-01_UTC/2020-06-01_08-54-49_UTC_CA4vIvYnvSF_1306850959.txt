🧳 Travel lightly. Happiness is inclined to get lost in the luggage. 🧳 I have to admit I’m not one who travels lightly because I love to dress up even during my vacations (though I’m trying to pack lightly)!🤣🤣🤣 However, I think the quote here also means to travel with a “light and trouble-free” mind. Leave all your stresses, problems, troubles, negativities at home. Just enjoy the vacation, the trip and focus on discovering new journeys, new cultures, new food and new adventures. Simply just have fun! Aw~~~ I’m so looking forward to travelling! 😍 Today, I decided to eat fried egg sandwich and planned to create a face out of the egg yolk. Unfortunately, my egg yolk burst in the pan. So, I slowly shaped my egg yolk within the pan and Surprise~~~! My egg yolk miraculously took on the shape of Woodstock! 🤪🤪🤪 So, I have a very cute fried egg Woodstock sandwich holding pretty strawberries balloons. (Btw, I washed my strawberries well with salt water and vinegar! 🤣) I’m really happy for the burst egg yolk because now I discover a new food art avenue using fried eggs! 🥰🤩 Happy Monday and Happy June everyone! 🌻
