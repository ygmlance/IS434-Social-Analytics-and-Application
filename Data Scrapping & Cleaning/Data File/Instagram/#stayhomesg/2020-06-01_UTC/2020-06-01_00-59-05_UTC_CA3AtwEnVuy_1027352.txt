@Angliss_singapore, the largest integrated food service company with seven decades of experience in Singapore’s food trading business, has launched their first-ever DIY meal sets for consumers. These are specially curated by the company’s corporate chefs, featuring the brand’s signature range of premium-quality beef, pork and fish.
I received two “Korean BBQ” sets to try and because I could choose from three available meats: the pre-marinated USDA-graded Beef Shortribs ($36), Batalle Duroc Pork ($28) or Bulgogi sliced beef set ($25), all marinated in a recipe by Angliss’s own chefs, I decided on both the red meats. They turned out to be very satisfying indeed. My family members and I cooked the beef on the grill, then savoured it wrapped in fresh lettuce with raw garlic slices (these were part of the #KoreanBBQ set). Smoky and sweetish, both the #Shortribs and the sliced beef managed to hit the mark. 
Besides the DIY meal sets, Angliss also offers a wide array of #halal and non-halal food products on their platform so you can attempt to prepare restaurant-standard meals at home. These include imported beef, both grass-fed and grain-fed beef, in different cuts, as well as an ocean of seafood (think caviar, whole asari clams, sashimi-grade Canadian scallop meat, cooked lobster, Hiroshima oysters, Vietnamese black tiger prawns and more). Pork from different parts of the world, pastas, cheeses and other dairy products, plus Western and Asian desserts.... the list you can choose to add to your shopping cart is seemingly endless.
