Circuit breaker Day 56: Soy sauce chicken from @haikeesg 👍👍👍 to mark the end of CB (& the start of Phase 1 😪) Really good soy sauce chicken, I dare say as yumz as Michelin star Hawker Chan. Flavour well infused, chicken succulent, juicy, not dry at all. Chilli was wonderful, felt that the ginger bits in the ginger sauce could be grated more finely & perhaps have less oil.
📍Hai Kee (Bedok)
