Beet Monday Hummus
[Ingredients]
/Beet Hummus/
-1 small beet
-4 cloves garlic
-1 canned cooked chickpeas (drain and reserve liquid for yogurt making)
-3 tbsp roasted white sesame seeds
-1/2 lemon (juiced)
-1/4 tsp sea salt
-A pinch of freshly ground black pepper
-1/4 cup olive oil
-1/4 cup pistachios (optional)
.
/Yogurt/
-Aquafaba -1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar (optional)
.
[Steps]
-Pre-heat oven to 180C. Cut stalk, scrub, wash, and wrap beet in a foil. Bake for 30 mins. Check if the beet is fully cooked by poking a knife through and it could be removed easily without resistance
-Wrap garlic (peel included) in a foil and place it in the oven 10 mins before the beet is done
-Separate chickpeas from the liquid (aquafaba). Save aquafaba and set aside
When the beet is cooked, allow it to cool. Peel the skin and cut into cubes
-Place sesame seeds into the food processor. Blend till it forms a paste. Add beet and blend until small bits remain. Add all hummus ingredients except olive oil into the food processor. Continue blending
-Drizzle olive oil as you blend the hummus
-For yogurt, whip aquafaba with a hand blender (best method) until desired consistency. Move the blender up and down as you are blending. It take about 3-5 mins for peaks to form. If it is still to watery, add 1/2 tsp of apple cider vinegar. Blend again until desired consistency
-Scoop yogurt with a spoon to serve as there may be some liquid remaining at the bottom
-Top hummus and aquafaba with some pistachios and serve
