As Singapore🇸🇬 begins to lift restrictions on 2nd June, many are anticipating the beginning of Phrase 1 for a new beginning. I look back and reflect how CB has changed me as a person personally🧒 and professionally👨‍💼 during these period.

As the new norm of engaging has evolved from being able to interact physically, i am glad that i am still able to make human connection 👬through social media👨‍💻 via various digital platforms🖱️. Appreciate all the people whom have spare their precious time to still continue to connect with me to find out about their current financial situation. These platforms also allow me to connect with my friends and family members to continue to keep each other sane 😅

Webinars 💻after webinars💻 are the new norm towards content learning. I begin to realise that knowledge does not necessarily drive new results📈. In fact, learning something new can actually be a waste of time if your goal is to make progress📉 and not simply gain additional knowledge. Thanks for all the selfless sharing from the experts and I look forward to less time passively learning and more time actively practicing. 
I am also officially a Stay at Home Circuit Breaker dad, working from home with my wife🤰 during this period while they managing our baby daughter👶. Glad to have these precious 8 weeks to watch my daughter grow as side by side; day by day. I am looking forward to embrace the new norm as I continue to build a better future for my family🏠. Stay safe to all!
