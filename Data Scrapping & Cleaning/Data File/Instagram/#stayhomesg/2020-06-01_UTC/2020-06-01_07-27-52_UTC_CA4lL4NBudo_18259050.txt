Circuit breaker SG is ending tomorrow and our government has decided that phase 2 could start as early as mid June if infection rates remain low during phase 1.Are y’all ready to resume life in a new world?
Im anxious as hell and will honestly be slightly paranoid.Nevertheless,beauty products always manages to save the day.The perfect plum shade for a matte lip on my skin from @milacosmeticsindia in Ecstasy.
Swipe for the raw pic to see its glorious colour.Also by far,one of the best product formulas for a non drying,lasting matte lip.Smooth,weightless & velvety.
I was highly impressed.😍 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #singapore #sg #makeup #glammakeup #makeuplooks #lipstick #mattelipstick #velvetmatte #milacosmetics #milacosmeticsindia #stayhomesg #stayhomestaysafe #stayhome
