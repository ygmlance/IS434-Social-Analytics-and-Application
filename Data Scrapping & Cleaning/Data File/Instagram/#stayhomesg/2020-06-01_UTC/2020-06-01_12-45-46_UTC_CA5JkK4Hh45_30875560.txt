[ 1 June 2020 // Circuit Breaker Day 56 ] Drew and coloured a DIY paper face mask out of fun today 😆 // So it’s the last day of the circuit breaker, and while most of us adults will continue working from home, the kids will be officially returning to school 😷. I’m having mixed feelings about this.. On one hand, I’m glad that they’ll get to see their teachers and friends again and most importantly, study in a proper classroom (it’s so hard for them to focus at home 🥵🤯) but on the other hand, I’m nervous about their safety and well-being 😣. Nonetheless despite all my worries and fears, I hope that they’ll have an enjoyable and safe back-to-school week 😌📝. Let’s hope everything goes well in phase 1! 🙏🏻❤️
