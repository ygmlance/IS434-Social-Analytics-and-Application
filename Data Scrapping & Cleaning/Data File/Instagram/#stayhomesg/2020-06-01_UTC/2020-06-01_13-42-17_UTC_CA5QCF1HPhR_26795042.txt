Crispy roasted duck, Crackling roasted pork, and Caramelized char siew are the 3 sinful Cs that I love (and I’m sure a lot of you too!).🦆🐽

If you’re a meat lover, I’m sure this will be right up your alley. We thought that we wouldn’t be able to finish the serving because it was quite a substantial amount - I can’t even fit all the serving of each dish in this photo.📸
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Ended up, it was so good that all of us cleared everything including slurping down the whole cup of milk tea (oops!).🤭💕
