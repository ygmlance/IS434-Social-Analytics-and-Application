Fancy some home-made char siew cooked with passion? Saw the post by @themixtapechef and instantly placed an order. This tender meat package arrived warm and charred to perfection, and instantly landed on my dining table and just an instantly gone from it. I could really taste the umami and the taste was just a nice balance of savoury sweetness. Actually I especially loved the charred parts.ðŸ˜‹ Look out for more pop drops of this koji infused char siew if you want to try! .
