Published on PERGAS’ blog on 01 Jun 2020, RRG member Ust Ahmad Saiful Rijal’s article emphasised the need to inculcate the attitude of wasatiyyah (moderation) in facing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Islamic law is primarily aimed to protect lives from harm, the community should heed the advice of experts such as those in the medical field, who are referred to as the Ahl Al-Zikr (knowledge bearers) in the Quran. 
Secondly, Ust Rijal calls upon the Muslim community to portray the right attitudes in facing the pandemic such as practicing wasatiyyah, taking preventive measures and obeying the authorities, as exemplified in the Quran and hadith. He cautioned that, during these difficult times, Muslims should be calm and refrain from blaming or punishing others.
