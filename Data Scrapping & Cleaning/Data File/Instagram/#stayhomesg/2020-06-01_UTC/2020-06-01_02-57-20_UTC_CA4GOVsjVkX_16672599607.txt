Breaking Circuit 57...
Last CB day! Yay...I think. Found the forbidden hidden Serapong underpass while sculpting bombom. Of course it was never there beforeðŸ™„. Unfortunately mozzies found me as well. I have to....scratch...think of their function in several ecosystems...itch.Â  Potential...scrape...medical treatments...ouch. Denque, move over! Hmm still don't like them close to me. Anyways, my extended warranty has expired and I can't be shipped back. So I was told during my island hike. But that is a good thing, now I'm for keeps...ðŸ¤”. Pfff.
