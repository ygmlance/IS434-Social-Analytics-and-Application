We ate a lot of oranges while staying home. I remembered watching something about citrus enzyme cleaner years ago and googled. No yeast to help with fermentation？Fret not! First bottle began: 7th April. More adventurous 2nd with brown jaggery sugar( 黑糖):April 11 Don’t waste the peel-Last one: April 15. Three month’s wait.😴Last photo taken 9 May. Realised I could use them as pesticide as well for my plants though！👍🏻👍🏻😁 #nparksbuzz #stayhomesg #citrusenzyme #citrusenzymecleaner #singaporeanyhow
