I have been wanting to do this for the past few weeks, and I finally set my mind to try it out.

I have stuck to the same ingredients that was used for my Itek Sio but this time I substituted the duck with mutton shanks.

The shanks were marinated for a day in a pool of mixture that consists of shallots, assam, sugar, coriander, vinegar, dark soy sauce and pepper.  It was then put to braise over low fire for another 2 hours. 
The end product was tender meat falling off its bone and a thick sauce fully flavoured with the sourness of the assam and vinegar but balanced off with the caramelised shallots and sugar.
