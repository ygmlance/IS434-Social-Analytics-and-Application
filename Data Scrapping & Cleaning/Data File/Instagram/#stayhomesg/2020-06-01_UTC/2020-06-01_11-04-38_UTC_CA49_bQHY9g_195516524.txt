#CircuitBreakerDay56 My second attempt at Jamie Oliver's recipe for #cabonara, added enough water so the consistency of sauce was just right, but the temperature of the pan wasn't cool down enough so the sauce wasn't smooth enough. Hopefully it will be perfect by the 3rd try 😅🙏🏼
It's so yummy I don't mind keep trying 😋😋😋
