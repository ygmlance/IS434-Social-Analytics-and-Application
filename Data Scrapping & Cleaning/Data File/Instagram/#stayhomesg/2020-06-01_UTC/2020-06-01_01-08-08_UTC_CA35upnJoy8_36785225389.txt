The light worked although I had to block out the morning sun with aluminium foil later cos my tender plants would all bend towards it when I overslept and was late in switching on the artificial lighting. 😅 Most obvious positive effect noted on my growing shallots! 😍I also repositioned the LED light to a more central position on the shelf. #seedlings #eggshells #stayhomesg #hdbbalconygardening #hdbgardening #growlight #springonion #daunbawang #indoorgardening
