Homemade curry udon!

Wet weather today calls for some comforting homemade curry dish😋 This curry udon is cooked using dashi stock and I really loved how it helps to enrich the flavour of the curry! Added ground pork, carrots, celery, mushrooms and onions to my dish. Topped with thinly sliced fried eggs. Wait... I'm hungry again😳
