#B4IMGONEChallenge

Today, I'm posting the entry from a multidisciplinary artist and creator of @wanderblooms, and it might be the perfect moment of zen you need today. 
Name: Supa Mojo 
Country:  Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ Love me #B4ImGone:  Supa Mojo is a pure artist, and gently and quietly surprises everyone with her ever growing list of hidden talents.  As a student of Hiphop triple, she practices the elements of Graffiti, Bgirling (break dancing) and emceeing, and stays active in Malaysia's community by organizing breakdance events like Floor Combat in KL, show casing her art works with her crew, The Secret Hideout, in galleries such as 321studios (KL) Hin Bus Depot (Penang) Awegallery (PJ) and spitting rap stylings influenced by Jurassic 5, Missy Elliot, and Nas to name a few. She has been featured on the title track of Malaysiaâ€™s all female crew #AV, released music with award winning producer @Navigator, and appears on my collaboration song "General Ling" with @cow & @generalling. Live performances at festivals and shows include KL Fashion Week 2015, Iskarnival 2016, Dongtaidu Music Festival 2017 and Tiger Uncage Music, Urbanscapes 2017. At the end of this month of June, I'm looking forward to her long awaited debut release, å®¶æƒ³æ¢¦ Dreamer EP consisting of 3 songs documenting her journey of living abroad and returning home, losing someone close to her heart and finding courage to face the world again. 
Masia's Fave #SupaMojo Art: Mojo's passion project @Wanderblooms has been something that constantly lights up my soul. She shares: "Wanderblooms is my little project in making the flowers in my head come to life, essentially the flowers would wander the world and bring a smile on someone's face". Her version of å‰ƒå¤´åˆ€é˜¿ç­¾ä¼ å¥‡ #B4ImGone and video of a #Wanderblooms creation is the perfect example of how serenity and peace can also be powerful. ----
