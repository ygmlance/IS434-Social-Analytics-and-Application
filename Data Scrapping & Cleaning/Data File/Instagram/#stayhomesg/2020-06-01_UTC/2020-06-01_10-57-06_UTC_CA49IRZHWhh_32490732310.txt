THANK YOU | Nurses and other health care workers on the frontlines of the fight against COVID-19 deserve to be recognized and commended for their lifesaving efforts and personal sacrifices amid increased medical risk -- and in some places amid ostracisation, harassment and attack. Send the frontline healthcare workers a message of appreciation to show your gratitude towards them.
