"I remember I chose to go Saudi to perform my pilgrimage at one of the earlier slots. I also wanted to celebrate my birthday there. I bought this watch before the whole pilgrimage was over. Partly to commemorate my development as a person there, partly as a birthday gift.⁠
⁠
This watch follows your pulse rate, so if you stop wearing, it stops working. And that is what our life is about right? It’s attached so strongly to our heartbeat, and it doesn’t use any battery because of that."⁠
