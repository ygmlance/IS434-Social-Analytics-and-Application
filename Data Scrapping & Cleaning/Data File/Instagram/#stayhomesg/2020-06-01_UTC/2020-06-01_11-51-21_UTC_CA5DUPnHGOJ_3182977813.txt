We had a blast with Mark Kramer during the Exclusive Zumba Fitness session yesterday evening! The turnout was great and we also had international friends joining the session. Thank you to everyone who gave our newest instructor on Team Axis Virtual Workout the warmest welcome yesterday, we could definitely feel the love and support! ðŸ¤—

For those who really enjoyed his session and want more of him, great news as he will be conducting weekly Zumba Fitness sessions with us! ðŸ’ª
