Circuit breaker Day 16: Dry beef noodles with soup on the side👍👍👍 Very good bowl of beef noodles with mixed beef parts, even when dabao-ed and left sitting for awhile because I was on a call. The tripe is perfect. Noodles were still chewy and very flavourful! Soup was beefy & herbal-y at the same time, can’t wait to try it there fresh next time!
