Next pic says, all the food is MINE!

Got my family a "Cheer Up - there's Me" celebratory lunch to say HELLO to more of me turning the house upside down~ 
20% off takeaway items too so you get an indulgent feast at the comforts of your own home! Today I ordered the Pork Knuckle, Organic Lacto Chicken, Salmon Rice Bowl and Garlic Chicken Rice Bowl! Loved the 5 grain rice option, sweet potato fries and yummy MEATS!!!! @mahotasg really never disappoints! #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg
