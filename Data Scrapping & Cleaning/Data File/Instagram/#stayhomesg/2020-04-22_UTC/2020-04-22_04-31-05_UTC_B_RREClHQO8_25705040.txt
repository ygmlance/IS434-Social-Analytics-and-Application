Until the Circuit Breaker is over and we can go back to our professional beauty salons for facials, weâ€™ve got some beauty tips for self-care at home

Take advantage of having more time on your hands to keep your skin hydrated and moisturised with pampering facial masks

If you have normal or dull skin, start with The Body Shop's Chinese Ginseng & Rice Clarifying Polish Mask first to prep your skin, before you hydrate your skin with their British Rose Fresh Plumping Mask

If you have oily or acne-prone skin, I'll suggest you to solely use their Himalayan Charcoal Purifying Mask and apply your serum and moisturiser after

For dry and dehydrated skin, their British Rose Fresh Plumping gel facial mask isperfect for you

Inspired by European bathing rituals, this facial mask is infused with real rose petals, rose essence, rosehip oil and organic community trade aloe vera ðŸ’•
