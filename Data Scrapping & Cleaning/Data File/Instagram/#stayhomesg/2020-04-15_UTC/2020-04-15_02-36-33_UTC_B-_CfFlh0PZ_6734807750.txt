We were reading a book and the last scene was of two children sleeping on a bunk bed. He stood up smiling and declared: Hugo wants to build a bed. Next he went into the room and pulled out a â€˜bedâ€™, pillow and blanket, hoisted it up the top bunk of his new bed ðŸ˜„ His sense of joy and pride to see his idea come into life is priceless. #followingjoy #followthechild #letthemexplore #letthemplay #bunkbed #bunkbedsforkids #imaginaryplay #playpretend #imaginativeplay #homesweethome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited
