Circuit breaker Day 6: Soba/rice bowls today, sort of a healthier option 👍👍👍 These 4 bowls cost $36.80, very value for money (esp the chicken / salmon), portions were substantial, overall a very yummy bowl! Ordered:
- Grilled salmon + rice
- Truffle mushroom + soba
- Cajun chicken breast + soba
- Striploin steak + soba
The onsen egg + edamame + corn were the default sides, quite commonly chosen as sides anyway I would think. Their business is doing well - grabfood orders were coming through so frequently for the few minutes I waited there 😂
