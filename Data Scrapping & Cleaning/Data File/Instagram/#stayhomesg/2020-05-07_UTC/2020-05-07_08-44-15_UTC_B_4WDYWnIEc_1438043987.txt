Hi Friends! Besides exercising, teaching online classes, looking after the household, Reading is top of my list of things to do! These are a few books that I have been reading since the start of the Circuit Breaker. 
From Bottom left: 
1. Bruce Lee the evolution of a Martial Artist: This book is about the paths Bruce Lee chose in his lifetime to develop his martial art of Jeet Kune Do and his philosophy of self actualization. A fascinating story about a remarkable man! 
2. The Art of Vinyasa: This book explores the art of Astanga Vinyasa yoga. A dynamite flowing sequence that coordinates movement with the gaze and the breath. This yoga practice take the form of asanas (poses), pranayama (breathing) and meditation. We learn to be focused and disciplined, while letting go,surrendering the ego while steadying the mind. 
3. The Laws of Human Nature: This book dives below the surface and see deep within, getting closer to the actual roots of what causes human behaviour. Why do some people turn envious and try to sabotage our work, or why some people imagine themselves as God like and infallible? What if we could look deep inside and understand people‚Äôs character? This book will teach you how not to react with emotions but rather with the desire to understand where this behaviour might come from. Good read! 
4. Brain Rules: This book helps you to understand how your brain really works and how to get the most out of it. It poses questions like: What exactly do sleep and stress do to our brains? Why is multi tasking a myth? Why is it so easy to forget?Very informative and engaging! üëç

So If you guys have extra time, These books come highly recommended! Enjoy! üåüüåº #stayhomesg #sgunited #familygoals #family #sgmum  #books #bookstoread #brucelee #brainrules #yoga#vinyasaflow #lawsofhumannature #selflearning #bookworm #fitmum #fitatfifty #stayhomesg #covid19 #stayhome2020
