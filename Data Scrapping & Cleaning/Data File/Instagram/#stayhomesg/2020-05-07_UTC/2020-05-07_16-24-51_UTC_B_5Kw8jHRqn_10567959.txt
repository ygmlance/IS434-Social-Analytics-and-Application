In just a blink of an eye, our little bun @hayley.chui has grown so much 😍 Those cooing, tummy time, flipping, crawling moments just passed by so fast, especially since I went back to work.

This CB period gave us some time to catch up and bond. But wfh with this tod on alternate days when I’m all alone is not easy I tell u. Jy to all the mums out there having to wfh.

Together, we can! 💪🏻
Hope this 🦠 will go away soon and we can get our lives back to normal cause we can’t wait to bring Hayley out to explore the world again 🧐👋🏻
