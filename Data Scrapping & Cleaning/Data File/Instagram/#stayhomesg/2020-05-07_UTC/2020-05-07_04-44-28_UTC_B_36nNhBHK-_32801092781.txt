Circuit breaker Day 31: New Lucky Claypot Rice 🍚👍👍👍 Have always loved their claypot rice, ordered it for lunch today (delivery fee $10). Still very good, soooo smoky & flavourful!! Doesn’t have the same heat & char you get when eating it from the claypot there but this is as good as it can get when delivered! The smokiness thooo 😛 Btw I ordered 1 pax more than the actual pax eating and it was just nice 😉
