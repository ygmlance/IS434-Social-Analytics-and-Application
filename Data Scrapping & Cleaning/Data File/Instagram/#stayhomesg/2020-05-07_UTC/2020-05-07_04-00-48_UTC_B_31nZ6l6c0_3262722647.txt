It’s Vesak Day! ☺️⁣

Today is the day where Buddhists all over the world celebrate the birth, enlightenment and death of Siddarhartha Gautama Buddha. A time of joy, peace, good deeds and reflection! ⁣

Isn't it great that we in Singapore get to experience and celebrate a host of religious and cultural diversity? 🇸🇬 😌🙌🏻⁣

As always, stay healthy and happy everyone! 😉 ⁣
