In this COVID-19 pandemic lies an invitation: What if you used this opportunity to let go of everything that isn't essential in your life, work, and institutional routines? How might you reimagine your life and work? Moses will be speaking on 9th May about making the most out of the uncertainty around the pandemic crisis.
