A day of peace and reflection - Happy Vesak!
.
Throwback to #vesak2019, when this lotus tealight holder, along with other amigurumi, were made for a charity sale.

Though many celebrations/festivals have to be celebrated quite differently this year, I do believe it's what you value most, that matters.
