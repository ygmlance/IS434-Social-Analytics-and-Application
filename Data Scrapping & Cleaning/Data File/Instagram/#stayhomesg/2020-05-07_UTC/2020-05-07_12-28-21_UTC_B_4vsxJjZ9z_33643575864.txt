We've seen that post going around telling people they should take this lockdown period as a time to be as productive as possible, picking up new hobbies and skills. If you're not working out everyday and learning a new language, you're not being lazy. We are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis, and it's okay if you're having a hard time dealing with it. Set aside that guilt and allow space for self-compassion. .
