#Didyouknow one of the most popular rituals on Vesak Day is the ‘bathing’ of Buddha. ⠀
⠀
Worshippers will scoop ladleful of water from the basins or pool, decorated with garlands of flowers, and then pour the water over the small central elevated statue of the child Siddhartha, in remembrance of the legend that the infant prince was showered with the waters of nine dragons after he was born. ⠀
⠀
One of the most iconic places of worship to witness this festival is the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, located in the heart of Chinatown.
