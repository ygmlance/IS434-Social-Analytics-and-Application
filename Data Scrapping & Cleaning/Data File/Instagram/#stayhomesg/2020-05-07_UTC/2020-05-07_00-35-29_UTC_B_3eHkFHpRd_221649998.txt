Lazy to post every time I run. So I just post together. Last Saturday: 6km, Tuesday: 2.5km, Thursday:5km. ‘Morning run is good. Not a lot of people doing workout, I think left over are more of regular and the rest maybe given up after some time. Exercise is a time of way to train willpower and determination. Giving up half way don’t really show a lot of this. A lot of people always give up halfway when they feel tired or bored. And that is always a reason y people don’t dare to step out of comfort zone. .

Don’t give up easily. .

Stay safe, stay home. .
