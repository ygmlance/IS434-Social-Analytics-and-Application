Day 31 CB - so the skies cleared for the wonderful view of the moon. See the next picture of the moon. The moment I’ve been waiting for. Picture taken with my iPhone against the telescope eyepiece, as DSLR adapter has not arrived yet.  Tmr I’ll take another with the Barlow for an even closer shot of the moon. This is so exciting! #astrophotography #orionstarmax127 #stayhomesg #moon #moonphotography
