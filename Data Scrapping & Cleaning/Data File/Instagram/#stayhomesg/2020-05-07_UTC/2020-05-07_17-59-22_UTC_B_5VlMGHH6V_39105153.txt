2020 New year countdown in Fukuoka : A largely unplanned journey which left us rather lost at some times 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️
.

Spent most of the time on the road, clocking expensive tolls, struggling to find food and then struggling to understand the menu. Renting a car equipped with snow tires anticipating a slippery drive but ended up not encountering one flake of snow. Brought heavy winter wear which turned out to be very useful indeed - so cold even though no snow!❄
Scroll to the end to see the fuming mount aso! 🌋 
It was a trip to remember, in a different way. Little will we expect that roaming aimlessly is not a luxury anymore.

Missing my road trips 😢🚙🛣️
Looking through my travel photos this CB, I've come to a learning point : 生命有限；钱是赚不完的。一定要在还有命的时候快点赚够，才够时间游戏人生. 💯
