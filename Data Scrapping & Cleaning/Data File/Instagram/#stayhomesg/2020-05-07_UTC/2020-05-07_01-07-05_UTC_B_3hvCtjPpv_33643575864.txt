Although none of us can go anywhere today, we hope you're getting some proper rest during this Vesak Day. Drawing the line between work and home life is difficult during this #WFH period, and many of us are actually working longer hours with fewer breaks in between. This is your reminder to really take a break for your own mental health today.
