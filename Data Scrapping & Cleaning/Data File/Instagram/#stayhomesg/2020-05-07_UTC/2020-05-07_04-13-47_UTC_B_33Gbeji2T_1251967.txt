MATCHA PANCAKE Dorayaki?!
No cakes never mind! There’s always pancakes from Belleville because they also served savory hot food on their menu (thus they can still operate). With 4 flavours to choose from, think:
.
1️⃣ Classic (SGD 4)
2️⃣ Cream & Custard (SGD 5)
3️⃣ Matcha Azuki (SGD 5.50) ⭐️⭐️
4️⃣ Cream & Custard with Strawberry (SGD 6) ⭐️
5️⃣ Pandora Box (3 for SGD 13.70/ 4 for SGD 15.70/ 5 for SGD 18.70)
