Happy Vesak Day to everyone. We understand that this year is not a good year to celebrate various events but we will stand together and fight Covid-19 together. Let us look forward to the light in front of us and stay focus no matter what. We also have to thanks the frontlines for their effort and times to protect us. Once again, Sports the Difference wish everyone a fruitful Vesak Day.

Stay safe and stay home.
