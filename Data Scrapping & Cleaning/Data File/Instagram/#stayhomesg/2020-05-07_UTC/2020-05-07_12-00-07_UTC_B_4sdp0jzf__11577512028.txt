While dogs 🐶, cats 🐱 and other furry friends have taken over our social media feed, are our lifestyles putting the animals and wildlife around us in peril? 😨

How are our everyday actions impacting the lives of our animal friends? Join us on Sun, 10 May at 2pm in our latest #GreenAtHomeSG event titled ‘Animal Friends’ to find out!

Besides a beautiful comic strip about the plight of polar bears, we’ve also planned an upcycling workshop conducted on INSTAGRAM LIVE 📹 which you can follow along easily from the comfort of your home! You’ll learn how to convert a plastic milk carton into a tissue holder 🧻 using simple upcycling techniques! This event is perfect for young children 👦👧 to learn more about environmental sustainability through activities that they can do at home!

To participate, simply follow us on our Facebook or our Instagram or indicate your interest in our Facebook event (link in bio)! See you on Sunday at 2pm!
