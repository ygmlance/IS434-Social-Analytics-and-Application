Breaking Circuit D31...MAKAN...
Today is simple. Plain basmati rice, straightforward panfried chicken thighs and uncomplicated stirfried Nai Bai. Simple🤷🏽‍♀️. Yummm. 
Relaxed lunch with citrus scented candles wafting through the air. No sound at all. Bliss...Perfect peace & quiet.  Wandering to Nirvana? 
Nibbling on the chicken bone, thinking of my well oiled joints, almost wrinkle-free skin and B-vit energy 🧘🏽‍♀️...Bon appetit!
