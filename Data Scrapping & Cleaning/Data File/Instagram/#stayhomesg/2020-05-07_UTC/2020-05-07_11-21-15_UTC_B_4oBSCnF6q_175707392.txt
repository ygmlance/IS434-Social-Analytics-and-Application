My Chef making sure food he cooks is clean and safe to put in mouth!
We used @59s_singapore to sterilise their toys, especially their pretend play food, which they tend to put inside their mouth. 
The toy steriliser can fill toys as much as a tray of ikea TROFAST
Storage box, 42x30x10 cm.
All it takes is 3mins to sterilise!
