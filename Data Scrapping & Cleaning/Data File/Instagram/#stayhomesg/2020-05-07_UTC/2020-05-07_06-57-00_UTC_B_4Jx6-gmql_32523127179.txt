Baby Spinach | Dates | Almonds 🥗
.
🍴Overall ease: 9/10
.
🛒Ingredients: spinach, rocket, red onions, dates, spiced breadcrumbs, almonds
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: Followed the recipe by @ottolenghi in #jerusalem quite closely, but added rocket (since we had leftovers), in addition to spinach leaves.
.
😋Taste: 7/10. Easy to put together, and good go-to recipe if you have spinach on hand or want a salad but have no idea how it should be dressed. It would be a great accompaniment to heavier dishes, like poultry and fish. But on its own, not a superstar
