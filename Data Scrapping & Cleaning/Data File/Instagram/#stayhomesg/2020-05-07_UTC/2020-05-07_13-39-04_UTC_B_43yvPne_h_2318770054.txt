You might have already noticed that friends and family member amongst you are becoming their own chef 🧑🏻‍🍳 and I encourage you to get up and make a meal for yourself too! 😄

For me, I prefer making western-style dishes and thus made it for my family after the end of my university semester! This dish, Honey Glazed Chicken with Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Brocolli was something I've always pictured together and I'm glad that I've finally brought it to life 🤗 If you're curious to make it yourself, ask me for this recipe anytime!! 😉
