Itâ€™s been more than 2 months I last posted on my feed?! And weâ€™re still stuck at home ðŸ˜ª This period is a true test of parenting creativity to keep the little hands and minds engaged. So here weâ€™ve re-purposed our @natureonedairysingapore milk powder tin for YK to work on his pincer grasp - inspired by @daprayer. Seemingly easy peasy task for us, but it takes effort for the little ones to master it. It was tempting to step in to assist, but resist and just watch them, they will troubleshoot it themselves!
