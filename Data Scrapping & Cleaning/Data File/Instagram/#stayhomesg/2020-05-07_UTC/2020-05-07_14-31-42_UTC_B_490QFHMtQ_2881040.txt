Putting this simple bean sprout dish to the record! Saw many people on fb growing beansprouts in a milk carton, so @jae.explorer and I decided to give it a try! We diligently watered and drained the water for it 3 times a day, for 4 days & today was harvest day!!😍😍 The beansprouts were so fresh & glad this experience has also encouraged lil jae to eat beansprouts.

Try it if anyone is keen: http://mymindpatch.blogspot.com/2020/03/growing-mun-bean-sprouts-from-carton.html?m=1
