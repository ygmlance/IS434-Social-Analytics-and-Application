@sodastreamsingapore, the leading sparkling water brand in the world (part of @pepsico), takes better care of our earth without compromising on our needs for a fizzy soda on a sticky warm day!
.
based on @sodastreamsingapore‚Äôs projected growth, they will save nearly 67 billion plastic bottles by 2025 alongside movements such as converting their drink mix bottles from plastic to metal, & the soda stream family to carbonate own soda and drinking from one reusable bpa free bottle!
.
the carbonating machine is easy to ensemble & use. it is also light to bring around and requires no electricity. beside low sugar or sugar free soda, i even tried carbonating to my juices & wines! ü•∞
.
now all of these make extra sense, especially when you love endless homemade bubbles while saving the planet! üåç
