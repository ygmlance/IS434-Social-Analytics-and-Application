[Recipe] Had this gorgeous emerald green smoothie yesterday, a great replacement for meals!

A handful of fresh Spinach
Half Mango
One banana
Half slice of Honey melon
Half a cup of fresh pineapple juice
Some Ice

Put all ingredients into the blender with liquid first. Blend till smooth and enjoy! ðŸ˜‹

P.s. sorry for using Road bump as background, I'm out for work and there's zero cars (do not try this). I really love stripe and the color combi. So ðŸ“¸
