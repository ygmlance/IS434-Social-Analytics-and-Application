Thank you Youth.SG for the write-up! 
No man is an island , no man stands alone.

We are indeed very stoked by the attention. 
What started off as something that we have always done on a regular basis became a point of inspiration and motivation for many across this tiny red dot we call HOME. 
We might not have achieved a lot, neither did we sew tens of thousands of masks. 
We did what we could amidst our own priorities, FHBL, revision for our year end national exams. 
Doing a shout-out to all youths too! 
It only takes less than a fraction of your time to contribute to the community. 
When your heart is willing, the rest will follow.♥️ ~ Bea & Adriel
