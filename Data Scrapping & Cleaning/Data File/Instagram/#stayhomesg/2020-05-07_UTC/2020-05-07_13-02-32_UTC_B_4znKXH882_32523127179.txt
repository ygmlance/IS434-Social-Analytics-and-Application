😋Taste: 6/10. Definitely laced with the delicious flavors of an authentic phad thai. That said, because we used rice noodle meant for pho as a substitute as it was tough finding proper Thai noodles, the #phadthai was stickier than usual. The sauce was also on the slightly sweet side for our palettes despite reducing the sugar so would need a bit more fine-tweaking. Would love to retry this recipe when we find the right noodles!
