07 May 20 :: Day 31 of CB #circuitbreakersg. #sgunited #stayhomesg and #je55cooks delicious Middle Eastern dish - #Shakshuka. The best brunch dish ever!
.
Craving for this dish from Jones the Grocer like since.. forever.. 😅 Never mind, I will satisfy my own craving today. .
Ingredients ::
1 can of tomato chunks
1 small can of baked beans
1 bell pepper
1 cup baby spinach, chopped
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 eggs

Spices to taste ::
1 tsp paprika powder
1 tsp turmeric powder
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
Sugar, if required

Method ::
Heat up some olive oil. Add garlic, onions, bell pepper and sauté till soft. Add in spices.

Pour in the can of tomato chunks and break the tomatoes. Add in the can of baked beans.

Simmer until mixture starts to thicken slightly. Stir in the chopped baby spinach and simmer further until mixture thickens to your liking. Adjust the taste to your presence. Add salt, sugar or more spices if required.

Make indentions in the sauce and crack an egg into each of them.

Cover and cook until eggs are set. Soft set will be the best. ** I overcooked the eggs. Yolks not that runny. ** Garnish with some black pepper and Italian herbs.

A dollop of smashed avocado and feta cheese will be good too! (I don’t have them at home.) Serve with warm toasties. I’ve scooped up the luscious tomatoes stew with my low-carb toasty slices. No spoon required. 😉

This meat-free, gluten-free, healthy and tasty dish is so versatile and simple to make. Nice cook for Vesak Day!
