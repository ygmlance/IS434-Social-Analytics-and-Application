Made by my Taiwanese friend. 
Sheâ€™s a seamstress and in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic she has hand-sewn & donated 20,000 pieces of these cotton face mask covers to hospitals & frontline healthcare workers in Taiwan.ðŸ¤— She is not rich but still is doing her part to give back to society. Now she wants to know if i can help her sustain through this crisis as she would want to supply to Singapore at a cost of S$5.50 per piece. 
They are washable & reusable. 
You will need to insert your own disposable surgical masks into this mask cover.
This way, you get double protection & will be able to extend the lifespan of the surgical mask (a precious commodity!) over say, 2 wears instead of a single-use, since more often than not we put on masks for only a couple of hours each time we leave our homes these days. "Wammaw.mask"... geddit? Hur hur hur... ðŸ˜·
7 colours available.
DM me for more details or if you are interested to pre-order.

God bless you and your families.. stay home and mask up when running essential errands.. don't join the sovereign crusaders ðŸ˜Š
