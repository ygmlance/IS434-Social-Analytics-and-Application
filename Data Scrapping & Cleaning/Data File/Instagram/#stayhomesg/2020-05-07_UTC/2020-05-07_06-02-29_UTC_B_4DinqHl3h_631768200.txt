Snacking on Calbee vegetables crackers.
In Japan this is a popular snacks with the children.
I used this Minna No Tabo’s bowl huggers to decorate this recycle plastic cup.
Cute decor can be fun to use for your stay home snacks or meal during this Circuit breaker. 😊
Btw, Minna No Tabo’s birthday falls on 5-5 which is Japan children day. 😊
Happy belated Birthday to Minna No Tabo🎂‼️
