FRIDAYS ARE FOR GUINNESS LAMB STEW

There is no greater comfort than a hearty stew! Lamb chunks and vegetables slow-cooked in a rich broth, spiked with Guinness Stout to bring out a robust flavour that feels like a warm hug. Served with baguette slices.

Choose portions for 1 or a party of 2, which includes a 4-Pack Pirate Life Throwback IPA.
