Repost• @heynickmitchell We are hiring for a part-time / full-time research and content creation role in the general life sciences space that is relevant to the health and fitness industry.
The following points are to be considered: *You can be based anywhere in the world. *You must have an appropriate academic background, to at least undergraduate level. "Appropriate" means a proven understanding of life, physical, or formal sciences. Sorry, but this job is not to cover S&C subject matter, so a sports science background won't cut it. *UP has collaborative research ongoing with Cambridge University and Addenbrookes Hospital, you will have the opportunity to help out with this and potentially get your name on research papers. *Your key focus will be on all relevant areas of biological science and you will be given carte blanche to explore those subjects most interesting to you so long as they have practical merit for improving the world's understanding of health and fitness, physical or mental. *You will be deadline oriented and enjoy working as part of a larger team. * the research we are doing will genuinely change the world, from acceptance and promotion of the health benefits of exercise by doctors and governments, to changes in the way people understand their own health and the consequences of how they live their lives. * compensation will be appropriate to experience and all enquiries should be directed to recruitment@upfitness.com with the header “life sciences research and content role”. Best of luck!
