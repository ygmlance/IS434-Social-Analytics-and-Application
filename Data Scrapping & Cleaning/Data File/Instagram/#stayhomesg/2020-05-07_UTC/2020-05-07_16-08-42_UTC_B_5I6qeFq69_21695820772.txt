Kat, our Queen 😍👑🤩 for 21st May 𝗗𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘆 𝗡𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗫 𝗙𝗮𝘄𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝘀 series is allowing us to get up close and intimate with her day spent during the extended #CircuitBreakerSG.

Will @iamkatherinesng cook, indulge in yoga or have a game or two with her boy?  Is she practicing better SUSTAINABILITY practices in her post #COVID19 #StayHomeSG period?  Let's find out.

Kat stole our hearts when we met her. Her zest  for life shines through her every action and she wants to advocate Sustainability and healthy living. Resilience is a word she does not take for granted having to run her many businesses, stay active as well as being a single parent to her boy.  She is the Founder of Piques Media and manages @Bubbamama and @Kombuchamama among other interests.

Bubbamama is an online magazine for Cosmopolitan Mothers who pride themselves on healthy living. When not fussing over their Bubbas, they keep abreast of fashion, beauty news and travel ideas and destinations. They strive to keep themselves healthy inside out and seek the best for their Bubbas. They advocate an empowered life for multi-faceted women.

Kombuchamama is Kat's business focused on delivering wholesome Kombucha to homes in the form of starter brewing kits. You find them on Lazada. Brewing Kombucha from home Kombuchamama way ensures many things that we love. You reuse equipment and containers without ditching single use bottles. You also get to select flavours and level of sweetness to your liking. Nothing like bespoke Kombucha to complement Fawn Lab's bespoke skincare! Love!
