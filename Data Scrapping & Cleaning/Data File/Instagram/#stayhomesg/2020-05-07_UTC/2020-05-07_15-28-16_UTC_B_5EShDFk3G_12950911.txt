Dear Logan, if I had to pick one person to be stuck on a desert island with, it will be you. We would probably dig >1000 holes in the sand within days, figure out multiple ways of collecting sea water and build sand sculptures along the beach, declare every specimen we find on the island to be treasure, invent different ways to break open a coconut, make our own superhero costumes with materials we find, attempt somersaults on sand, pretend to be a different superhero everyday and rescue our made-up friends on the island, be the noisiest 2 people ever stuck on an island, give special names to every single plant living on the island, feed each other an endless supply of imaginary food and laugh at our own jokes. You would probably be the one telling me not to be afraid of all the flying bugs on the island and hug me tight. We will laugh together, always let ourselves feel our emotions and check on each other with generous hugs and kisses. And the most uttered words to each other, will always be - “I love you” and “I’m grateful for you”. 💛
