Mask is a very important part of my regular skincare routine. On top of applying hydrating mask every week, I get to know this awesome product through a friend & am glad to share it with you here.. I love the after effects of it hence decided to sell it myself 😁 
Ellure tomato bubble mask dissolves and remove dead skin cells without scrubbing and damaging the skin protective layer. While exfoliating, it replenishes moisture and strengthen the skin barrier. Giving you refreshing, rejuvenated healthy glowing skin! ✨
