👆🏻DID YOU KNOW👆🏻You can cook a good oyakodon with just one rice cooker?? We did a trial test at home before filming the Eatbook vlog (link in bio). And here’s the mom-safe recipe which serves 2:

Ingredients:
1 cup rice
1 cup chicken stock or dashi stock
2 chicken thigh, cut into bite-sized chunks
3 eggs
1 large onion, sliced into long strips
Spring onions (optional, BUT U CAN TELL FROM 2ND PIC IT LOOKS BETTER WITH SOME GREEN ON IT)

Chicken marinade:
1 ½ tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp mirin (or 2 tbsp vinegar + 1 tsp sugar for non-alcoholic version)
4 tbsp chicken stock
¼ tsp sugar

Directions:
1. Marinate the chicken with soy sauce, mirin, chicken stock and sugar. Let sit in fridge for 30 minutes.
2. Wash rice, drain, and pour in chicken or dashi stock.
3. Place chicken chunks and onions on top of the rice and hit “Cook”.
4. Pour lightly whisked eggs in when the rice is cooked.
5. Close the rice cooker to cook the eggs on “Keep Warm” setting for at least five more minutes. Serve with a garnish of chopped spring onions.
