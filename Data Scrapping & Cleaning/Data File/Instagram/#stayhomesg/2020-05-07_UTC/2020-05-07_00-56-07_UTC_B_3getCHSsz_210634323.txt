She loved the memory game! Initiated to take it out and play again. And she kind of remember where some shapes are already 🤣🤣 Time to change something else

Saw a number of pens on my table and started exploring them asking me what is the right way to click and “unclick” the pen

Primary and secondary colour! We learnt that red and yellow make orange! Which is the carrot’s colour

Yesterday was also one of the days she initiated to take out the letter sounds from the shelf to play

@tai.tylee pastes 2 stickers on her cos she said she wanted to be pikachu 😑 and we played shadow at night before bedtime!
