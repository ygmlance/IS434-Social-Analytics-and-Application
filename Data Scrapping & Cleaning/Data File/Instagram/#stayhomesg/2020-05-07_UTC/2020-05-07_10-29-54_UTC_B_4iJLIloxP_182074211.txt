Finally got around to creating another mixtape after taking some time off. I think that weâ€™re all going through a tough time so I took some of my favourite deep house tracks and created this to share some good vibes with you guys. Also managed to sneak in an original from our Confessions EP inside the mix. Let me know if you like it! Link is in my bio.
