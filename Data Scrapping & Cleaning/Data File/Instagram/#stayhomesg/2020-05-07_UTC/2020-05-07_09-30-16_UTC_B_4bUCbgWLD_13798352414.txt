I've decided to do a #30dayschallenge by cooking vegan meals EVERY FREAKING DAY, (tormenting my love ones with meatless but awesome food 😈) and share my amateur recipes with you guys. 😎⠀
⠀
Homemade Barley⠀
Barley - 1/2 pkt / est. 200~250g⠀
Dried Melon Strips - 1 pkt / est. 200g⠀
Pandan Leaves - UP TO YOU!⠀
Rock Sugar - UP TO YOU!⠀
A WHOLE (est. 4~5l) POT OF WATER, THROW THEM ALL IN AND BOIL!⠀
⠀
Boil till you're happy, no time, no limit, boil till your heart feels fit. (The longer you boil the thicker it becomes, depends on your liking do whatever u want!) 😆⠀
⠀
Note: However long u want to boil, it's really up to u but, please remember to boil in medium-low heat, you do not want black barley! 😜⠀
