Easiest Tomato Cheese Pasta 🍝👌🏻
Here’s a little trick : Use HDL’s instant tomato soup base as the pasta sauce to get a lot of flavor without using any other seasoning!! I had to clear out the fridge so I added a weird combination of preserved veggies, chinese sausage and pork belly to my pasta but hey, it actually turned out much better than I expected! Haha oh & the egg yolk added some creaminess to the pasta so I totally recommend the addition of eggs here. So here you go, the easiest way to satisfy your pasta cravings (& clean out the fridge if you have to)😋😋😋 #ShersVideoRecipes #Stayhomesg #StayHomeWithAscott
