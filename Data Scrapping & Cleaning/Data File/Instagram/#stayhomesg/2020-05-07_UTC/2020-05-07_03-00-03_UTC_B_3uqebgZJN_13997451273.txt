Happy Vesak day to all of us! Celebrating the birth, enlightenment, and the passing of Buddha. But do you know the significance of each celebrations? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Celebration of Birth of Buddha 
It was said that the Buddha took 7 steps when he was born on Lumbini Park under the rose apple tree. The first 7 steps represents self confidence.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Celebration of Enlightenment of Buddha 
Buddha sat beneath a sacred Bodhi tree when he was awakened. In the course of his awakening, Buddha was tempted by Mara's 3 daughters. The 3 daughters symbolises the 3 poisons: delusion, greed, and hatred which are to be counteracted by wisdom, generosity, and loving kindness. Having victory over the defeated Mara, Buddha attained enlightenment. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Celebration of Passing of Buddha 
After gaining enlightenment, Buddha thought Dhamma for the rest of his life. His last words was: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“... all conditioned phenomena are subject to decay; strive on with diligence…”
(vayadhamma sankhara, appamadena sampadetha) - Mahaparinibbana Sutta
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Taking the Buddha as our role model, let us make aspirations to "wash off" our own greed, hatred, and ignorance, and practice the Dhamma.
