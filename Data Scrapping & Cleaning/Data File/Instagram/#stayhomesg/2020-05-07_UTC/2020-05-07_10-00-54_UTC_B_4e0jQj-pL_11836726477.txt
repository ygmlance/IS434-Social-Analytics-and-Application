A lesson on linear equations with a Sec 1 student!
.
Luckily we have went through this a couple of time physically before all the HBL and circuit measures kicked in.
.
Are you learning well at home!?
.
Do take some time off this holidays to review and revise on the things taught during HBL so that you will not be lagging too far behind when school reopens on 2 June (hopefully)
