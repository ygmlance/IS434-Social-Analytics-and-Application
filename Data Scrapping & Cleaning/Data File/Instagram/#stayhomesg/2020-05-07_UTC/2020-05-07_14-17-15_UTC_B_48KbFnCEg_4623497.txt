Wondering what life is like with a non-stop GO GO GO toddler at home 24/7?

I don’t even know how many weeks we’ve all been stuck at home.. but this is our new routine.

These photos are all taken in 1 day. It gives a pretty good idea of all the things Chloe and I get up to.

Meanwhile, the older 2 boys are doing their own work, reading, or joining in!

And if you’re wondering “so when do they get to use iPads?” Well, the boys have 1 hour of screen time daily now, due to this whole stay-home doozy. They get it just before dinner time, IF they have behaved well during the day.

Chloe is absolutely loving being home with all of us. I really wonder how she’ll handle going back to preschool in another months time!
