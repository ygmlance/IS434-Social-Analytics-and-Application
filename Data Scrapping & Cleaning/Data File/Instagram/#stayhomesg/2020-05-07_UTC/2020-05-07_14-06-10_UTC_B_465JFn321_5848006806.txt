The little miss has been busy making cards for our migrant workers this week. We can’t imagine what they’ve been going through the past few weeks and we just wanted to share some words of appreciation and encouragement because where would Singapore be without them. With the hubs working in construction, I’ve heard countless stories about their lives here, back home and what they go through every month to give their families a better life. It’s an incredible sacrifice but yet many are treated poorly and unfairly. Let’s hope that with this coronavirus bringing to light just how bad many of them have it, we can expect some positive changes. .
