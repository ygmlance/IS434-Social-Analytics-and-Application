First time bidding for fishes via livestream on fb. Technology had changed the way we buy things. Buying food online is common but bidding fishes online is not. Bought this piece of unagi at $13 each. Put the whole vacuum pack into boiling water. Thereâ€™s some fishy smell so Guess I try squeezing lemon for the next round.
