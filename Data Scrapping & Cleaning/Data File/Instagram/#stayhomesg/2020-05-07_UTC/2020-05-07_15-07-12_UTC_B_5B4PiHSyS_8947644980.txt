Itâ€™s never too late to start eating healthy especially when the Covid-19 Pandemic has forced us to stay indoors for a long period of time due to the Circuit Breaker.

Not surprisingly, this lockdown can promote unhealthy eating habits as we tend to binge-eat on processed food and food high in saturated fats for snacks or even meals.

Good thing @w.acai.sg offers Acai Healthy Bowls and delivers orders conveniently at your doorstep.

Acai bowls are essentially thick smoothie superfood bowls loaded with healthy toppings. They are made of pulped and flash-frozen acai berries that are pureed with other frozen fruits then served in a bowl and topped with a variety of fresh fruit, granola, seeds, nuts, peanut butter, etc.

The Iron Man and White Collar W Acai Bowls ($6.80 each) taste so good. They have this healthy ice cream - like taste that can make you feel good about eating hearty breakfast or snack choices. Not only will you feel happily full (for hours) and satisfied but also you will satisfy your sweet cravings. Love the TG Melon Honey Tea ($3.20) too. It tastes amazing and super refreshing!

Researchers say that 20-percent improvement in diet is very doable for most people with simple substitutions. Replacing one serving of processed foods or foods high in saturated fats with healthy fats or proteins like nuts, legumes or avocado is a simple way to accomplish this.
