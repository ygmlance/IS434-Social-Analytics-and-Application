🍊How can MOFA work for you? 🍊 
Our intestines are about 7m long, & some people may have up to 10kg worth of toxins clogged in their body. 💩 💩 💩 
Even for those who poop daily, there may still be accumulated fecal impaction stuck within the walls.
Orange MOFA contains psyllium husk as one of its main ingredients, and it’s able to gently scrape these toxins out from our body.
The enzymes in MOFA also helps break these particles up, & allow our body flush it out easily.
✨Huge bonus: while many other detox drinks taste quite bad, MOFA has a refreshing orange flavour, which makes you look forward to drinking it!
To enjoy the benefits of detoxing, consistency is key 👍🏻
