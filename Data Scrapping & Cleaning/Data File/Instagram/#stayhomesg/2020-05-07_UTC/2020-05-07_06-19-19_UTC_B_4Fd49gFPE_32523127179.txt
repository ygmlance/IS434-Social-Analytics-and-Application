Chermoula Eggplant | Brown Rice | Yogurt 🍆
.
🍴Overall ease: 8/10
.
🛒Ingredients: eggplant, spices, cilantro, brown rice, almonds, yogurt
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: Recipe adapted from @ottolenghi #Jerusalem cookbook, except to substitute bulgur (which we couldn’t find) with brown rice (which we already had cooked). Roasted it at 200 degrees for 40 mins and it was perfect!
.
😋Taste: 10/10. Another winner from @ottolenghi and @sami_tamimi. The chermoula was particularly outstanding - we would slap it on other vegetables and meats! A true orchestra of textures (a bed of silky eggplant with different kinds of “crunch”) and we love being able to pick up each half slice - like half a sandwich, and consume it that way
