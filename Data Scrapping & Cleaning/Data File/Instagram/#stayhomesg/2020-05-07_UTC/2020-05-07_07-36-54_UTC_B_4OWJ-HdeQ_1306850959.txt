🌾May you find happiness in both the central and the smallest, quietest, gentle, little things. 🌾Just now, I was very amused by three little birds who were strolling on the same path in front of me. It seems that nature, birds, pigeons, butterflies are all enjoying their peace and harmony during this CB period (without disturbance from humans). 😂 Was craving for tuna so I went to Northpoint City Subway to get my favourite tuna sub. 😋😋😋 Then along the way, went to NTUC and Cold Storage and spent a lot of money again! 😅 All the fruits in NTUC look especially tempting and I bought some US strawberries, which are on sale now. BIG and sweet! 🍓🍓🍓Also, new purple lavender-looking flowers from Cold Storage. So pretty! 😍On my way home, I realised how blessed we are to have huge rainforest trees providing shelter in this hot hot weather. Everything just look better today. I think it’s because today is a public holiday! 🥳🥳🥳
