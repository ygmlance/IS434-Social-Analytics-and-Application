How cool is it to have this little guy as a travelling companion? Join him on his urban explorations on Earth!😛
. 
also... I made a thing! This spaceship was jointly designed by @judejudedraws and me... then he commissioned a hand-sewn felt brooch (swipe to see!), all paid for in hugs and kisses 🥰
. 
Just for the fun of it, I’ve packaged it in professional looking packaging too 😜
.
Hope everyone’s staying safe, physically and mentally. I’m always available to talk or just to listen, if you need a listening ear ❤️ sending virtual hugs to everyone! .
Finally, Happy Vesak Day to my friends who are celebrating 😊 I’ll be spending the day with my boys 👨🏻👶🏻👶🏻🐶 and trying to catch some sleep before night shift tonight!
