Dear Tai Cheong Bakery fans, we hope you are holding up well as we get through this circuit breaker together! #SGUnited⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
In compliance with the strict rules laid down by MTI with regard to our manpower on-site, we are unfortunately unable to provide individual packing services for bulk orders (unless your orders are to be sent to separate locations). ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
However, we are happy to provide extra packaging so that you are able to distribute the individual items yourselves. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Orders above $200 are also entitled to complimentary 'Gift Notes' customised with individual names to make gifting easy for you during this period!⁣ #taicheongsg
