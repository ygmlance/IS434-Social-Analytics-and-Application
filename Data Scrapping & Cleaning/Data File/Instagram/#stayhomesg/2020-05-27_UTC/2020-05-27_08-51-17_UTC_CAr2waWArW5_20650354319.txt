Byebye Brassy hair

In order to keep cool blonde during this circuit breaker, I decided to give Rebecca deep dark ash blonde, WHY?! Because dark pigment will prolong more than light blonde. (This work we done before CB start,hehe I’m latergram,Pls forgive me)

Keep cool and stay home
See you guys in June~ Can’t wait to paint all my DREAM client hair🌈😍 #deepdarkashblonde
