Finally got my hands on the super hyped comeback of the beloved coconut pie by @mcdonalds @mcdsg Singapore! Always excited to try out new culinary innovations, I went ahead and did a taste test! Here's a list of all that I loved about the pie!
1. The crispy, golden puff pastry covering the pie is definitely the winner.
2. The packaging is a real treat to look at.
3. The intensely hot and gooey coconut stuffing has a subtle flavour that hits all the right notes.
4. Lastly, it doesn't set off a sharp pain in your teeth because it isn't overtly sweet. Just the right amount of sweetness!
So go ahead and comment below to tell me weather you tried the pie, and how it fared!
