So it is school holidays now, and how are you holding up, fellow parents? I am not going to lie, it is tough getting MY kids to do any form of revision work during this period. All they want to do is to binge watch on their devices or connect with friends over a game of Fortnite.

For me, I had just enforced a “revision before play” schedule recently because I cannot tahan already! Got them to commit to doing their Koobits Math daily challenges before they get their reward of some leisure time. They cannot cheat too because I can easily monitor all their progresses on the parent’s app. Hopefully their Math will improve!

The kiddos can work on laptops, e-tablets or even the phone so it makes it easy for this family as we adults need our laptops for work as well! No more excuses of lack of resources for now! Well, with a monthly fees going from $12 and you also get 10% off when you use the code [K20GOI10], this may be a good time to try it! Oh they also offer free weekly homework here - https://www.koobits.com/public as well.

Also good news for you readers too as I have a 2-year subscription plan to give away to one of you who like and follow @koobits / @theperfectfather and share this piece of news in whichever way that grabs your friends’ and my attention.  Good luck to all and a winner will be chosen end Fri, 05 Jun 2020.
