As nonchalant a father I may appear to be to many, when it comes to the health of my kiddos, I do have my concerns. Hence the preparation of masks, shields, hand sanitizers and constant nagging on hand washing for going back to school.

Do you know that studies had shown that UV light is effective in "killing" off germs and viruses by damaging their DNA or RNA? That's why fish keepers uses UV to get rid of pathogens in the water, and there are lots of products out there that utilizes it to sterilise toys and pacifiers too.

Was introduced to Cleanaire from @nvcinternational recently and now I use it in our room to "clean" the air as well! It uses both UV and Ozone to sterilise and has an effective range of 2„é°. With its portability, I think it would be great for use in cars too.

Well to be honest, it would be hard to see and report any difference or improvements, if one can see those germs and viruses in the first place. But at least, we are doing whatever we can, to make it a little safer for our loved ones! Get 25% off with code [perfectfather25] if you decide to try too.
