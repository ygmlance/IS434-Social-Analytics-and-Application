Working from home is now the new normalcy. The quarantine period 😷 is the best time to showcase your creativity, and i don't mean baking, but creativity at the home desk!

Here's my pink themed #WorkFromHome 🏠setup, of course with some of my fave picks from @etudesingapore so i can still look my best for video calls!

Elated to receive a care 🥳 pack from Etude House so i can pamper my skin & restore my mind after a hard day at work!
