Harry’s // If you’ve never tried Harry’s Truffle Mushroom Flatbread before, STOP SLEEPIN ON IT. It is easily one of the best flatbread pizzas I’ve ever had. The crust itself isn’t your usual pizza dough and resembles more of a thin buttery biscuit. Topped with melted cheddar, mushrooms and a drizzle of truffle oil, every bite is just d i v i n e. We also got their Bacon Carbonara and Aglio Olio which was SUPER GOOD. 
They’re having an insane $25 for 2 pastas/pizzas now so go for it y’all!!! So worth.
