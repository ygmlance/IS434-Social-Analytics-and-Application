Anyone know why green beans need to be soaked and drained before cook?

Most roots are easy to digest and nutritious, tell me your favourite roots! (yam, potato, tapioca, beetroot, carrot, radish, ...) Tapioca has a reputation as being gentle on the stomach. It is free of gluten, nuts, and grains, so it will not cause a reaction in people with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and nut allergies.
