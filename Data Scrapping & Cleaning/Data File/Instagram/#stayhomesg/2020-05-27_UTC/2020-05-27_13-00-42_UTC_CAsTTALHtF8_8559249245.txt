Do you miss those carefree summer holidays when you helped your grandmother make those yummy pickles that were stored in big jaadis (ceramic containers)? Made from recipes that have been passed down generations, our home made pickles from our Paati's kitchen make for a great side dish. No meal is complete without a side of oorgai! 
Just prepared a fresh batch of Manga Oorgai (mango), Nellikkai Oorgai (gooseberry) and Thakkali Oorgai (tomato). To order visit order.podiandporiyal.com
