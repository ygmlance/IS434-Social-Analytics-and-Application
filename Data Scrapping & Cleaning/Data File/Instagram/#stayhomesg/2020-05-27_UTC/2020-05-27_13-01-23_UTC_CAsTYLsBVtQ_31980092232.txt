Now that preschools are reopening on ‪2nd June‬ in Singapore, it can be jarring for children to transit back to school routine after all this time at home. Here are five tips to help you ease the transition.
.
Informing and talking about school with them allows them to be mentally prepared. This is also a great time for them to share their concerns and worries with you. Be open to any negative reactions that your child may display but also reassure them that it is perfectly okay to feel that way.

Packing the school bag with them makes them feel secure and confident; knowing that going back to school is a team effort. You may also start conversations using the items. For example, you may take the shower bag and say, “Do you remember that you bring this bag to the shower in school?” or “In school, you wear this set of uniform in the afternoon”, etc.
.
Showing pictures of your child having fun in school will help to bring back some fond memories of school life! You may also show pictures of friends and teachers so that your child recognizes and feels comforted by the familiar faces they will see when they head back.
.
A comfort item may also help to ease your child’s anxiety. Allow them to pick their comfort item to bring to school. You may say, “If you are sad, you can hug Mr Bear. Mr Bear will help to make you feel better again. Mr Bear will always be in your bag.”
.
Lastly, validate their feelings. It is a significant change in their routines, and children may feel a mix of emotions. Stay calm but confident, and assure them that they have your support. Remember to be their base and allow them to feel all the feels. We’ve got this!
