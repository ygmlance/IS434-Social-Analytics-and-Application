“I never imagined I would close out this decade with less than 9% body fat and in the best shape of my life!"⁠
.⁠

Ross had almost hit 100kg when he decided enough was enough.⁠

As he focused more on his career and started putting in long hours at his office, exercise and nutrition were put on a back burner.⁠

For someone who had always kept fit and was proud of his athletic frame – the reality of his weight gain was hard to ignore.⁠

"Being out of shape definitely did affect my confidence, whether I like to admit that or not."⁠

Ross joined @upfitnesslosangeles weighing close to 99kg and carrying 22% body fat – in just 20 weeks he lost 19kg, 12% body fat and 6 inches off his waist.⁠
