Fish Maw (“鱼鳔”) is commonly used in Chinese broths and it is rich in proteins and nutrients such as phosphor and calcium. It is also known to nourish your kidneys, healing weak lungs and overall boosting one’s stamina. Thus, it is considered as a kind of therapeutic food. As it as contains collagen, it is also helpful for giving you your glowing complexion.

With this knowledge in mind, our Chefs specially created our Superior Fish Maw & Abalone Slice Soup. This broth is packed with other nutritious ingredients such as Mushrooms, Sea Cucumber and Crab Meat. We only produce a limited batch, so do give it a try before it is gone!
