Staying at home means alot of pent up energy. I try to let the children exercise with random action games and obstacle courses. But my favourite is still doing simple yoga with them.

Iâ€™m not an expert but I like how the poses strengthen their muscles as well as improve their balance and coordination. Weâ€™ve still got a long way to go but it makes me happy that Little Man requests for yoga some days by himself!

We love Cosmic Kids Yoga, and Little Miss screams in excitement for the Yoga Disco segment ðŸ˜‚ Swipe for some yoga scavenger hunt action around the house that we did with yoga cards!
