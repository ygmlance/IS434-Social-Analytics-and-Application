😋Taste: 10/10. A regular rotation for dinner! Over the years, we’ve learnt that we 1) we prefer lean steaks (the lack of favouritism towards wagyu is a blessing on our wallets!), and 2) sous vide is a foolproof way of achieving the #perfectsteak. Not to mention, steak night is a great excuse to bust out papabear’s precious French wines 😉
