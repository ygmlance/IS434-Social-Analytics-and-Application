| 🥖🍞| All you knead is love. 💕
Happy and satisfied faces after tucking into warm, freshly baked bread could well be my next muse. 😊
There are so many things that can go wrong in the process of bread-making, but I’ve also learned to find joy in the mistakes (or surprises sometimes!) and remember that this is all done in the name of love. 😋 it’s also extremely therapeutic for an extrovert, who’s been singing to her bread dough while baking.
