Baked some coffee buns yesterday! Its also our first attempt at bread making☺️ Impressed by how it turned out to be, but... we forgot to add flour to our coffee mixture?! So the coffee spread at the top didn’t hold its shape when we put the buns in the oven 😅and didn’t give the crispy texture like what its supposed to be!

What you’ll need:
For the dough 🍞
~ Bread flour
~ Sugar
~ Salt
~ Dry yeast
~ Warm milk
~ Unsalted butter
For the coffee mixture ☕️
~ Instant coffee
~ Warm water
~ Butter
~ Sugar
~ Egg
~ Plain flour
