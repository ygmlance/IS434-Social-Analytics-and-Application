Rise & Shine! Woke up today with a surprising cold cooling weather and we were so reluctant to leave that cosy bed 🛌 for the supermarket! Staring at the milk section, we saw the last bottle of F&N Magnolia 𝐿𝒾𝓂𝒾𝓉𝑒𝒹 𝐸𝒹𝒾𝓉𝒾𝑜𝓃 𝗕𝗥𝗢𝗪𝗡 𝗦𝗨𝗚𝗔𝗥 & 𝗦𝗘𝗔 𝗦𝗔𝗟𝗧 𝗙𝗟𝗔𝗩𝗢𝗥𝗘𝗗 𝗠𝗜𝗟𝗞 (Yayyy! 🤭🙊✌🏻) and decided to snag that last bottle to see what the hype was all about! ⠀ ⠀
As we pour the milk out, we were taken aback that the milk was still white in color instead of brownish.. Took the first sip and we tasted the milk with brown sugar and a hint of sea salt taste that’s not overwhelming the milk taste. We were so surprised to see the healthier choice logo on it with the words - Lower in Sugar & Saturated Fats! Wow! It really tastes like Brown Sugar Bubble tea without pearls! ⠀
