[New must-have product + DC “SIN11” for 25% off] .
.
Preparing my essentials when I go back to work tomorrow😓Just a simple kit, since we will be all wearing masks! .
.
A new MUST-HAVE addition to my kit is this new Norya UV-C portable spot steriliser fro @qlearplus , which has sold thousands in Hongkong, as most families have them (In Manila there is another brand which is currently sold out). During this period, we can never compromise safety, and it is best to take all measures in ensuring everything that we touch or put in our mouth is clean. This steriliser works well when you are out and about, use it to spot sterilise your baby’s pacifier, utensils, toys (especially when it drops!). Before holding any high-touch surfaces, let’s say, you’re at the grocery and taking a shopping cart, please sterilise the handle using this! It can be very useful in many ways you can think of. .
.
What I like about Norya Steriliser:
✅Disinfects 99.9% in 10 seconds .
✅Produces UV-C in wavelengths 240-280 nm .
✅ USB charging which is convenient
✅ Unlike wet wipes and hand sanitizers, this can be used on all surfaces
.
.
You can check them out and use “SIN11” for 25% savings when you cart out! I think it is a great deal that you can’t miss! I think I will use this when I go to work and clean my classroom😆
