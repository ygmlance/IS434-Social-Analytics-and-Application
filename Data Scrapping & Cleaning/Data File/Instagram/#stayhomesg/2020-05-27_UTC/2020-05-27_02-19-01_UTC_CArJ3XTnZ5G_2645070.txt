Chef Houston in the house today 🤣🤣🤣 ⁣
Come show him your biggest support 💪🏻👏💯 ⁣
⁣
⁣
@tottstore sent over their latest launch, the Junior Chef Activity Box. Inside this box, it’s filled with beautifully illustrated recipes making it easy for kids to understand. Let them be the chef of the day and I shall be his left hand assistant for this time round 🤣✨✨✨💕🌈 ⁣
⁣
⁣
Baking tools are provided inside the box and it’s not toy tools but REAL tools 🥣🍰🍪 I always believe to let kids manage the proper equipments when it comes to sports or cooking. Afterall, in time to come they will have to use it so might as well start them early but under supervision 👀 ⁣
⁣
⁣
Gonna make a run to the supermarket 🛒 to gather all the ingredients needed because Chef Houston can’t wait to earn some pocket money for his food💰💰 #schoolisreopening ⁣
⁣
⁣
Each activity box is retailing at $39.90 and they can be purchase on https://tottstore.com/junioractivitybox/ ⁣
I’m looking forward to all our junior chef bakes! ✨✨✨⁣
