City Hotpot 🍲 has recently launched its FREE Island-wide delivery, with no minimum spend required.

Available in both Ala-carte & set meal and 15 soup bases to choose from; all their ingredients are freshly packed into individual containers placed in a cooler bag.  They also thoughtfully provided the sauces and condiments too. 👍

We had the Set B ($62.99++) that serves 2 pax and it comprises of Wagyu Chuck Eye Roll, Pork Collar, Fish fillet, Prawn paste, Fresh Prawn, Crabsticks, Handmade Tofu, Vegetables and Mushroom Combo, Sauces and choice of 1 staple such as Pearl Rice, Vermicelli, Udon, Mee Sua for each pax. For the soup base, we had the peppery Bak Kut Teh soup that came with 2 pieces of ribs.
