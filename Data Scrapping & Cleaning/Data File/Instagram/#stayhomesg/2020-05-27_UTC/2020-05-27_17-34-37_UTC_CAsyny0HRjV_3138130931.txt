May 2020 - Day 50?? Not so sure anymore... But Ada's snores are music to my ears as they mean "Mummy gets time off!"
.
It's important to have breaks, and now more than ever, as Ada wake time is super exhausting! She totters, crawls, climbs, bangs, plays with so much energy that I swear she's the real-deal energiser bunny.
.
When she naps well, she is happy and mummy is happy. When this screws up, I'm doomed for the day with a cranky doodle baby. What do I do with my breaks?
.
Frankly, I nap with her on most days. I've switched around my working hours that I can't really fall asleep till 1-2am daily. Oh wells, hope I can readjust my body clock, if all things go well!
