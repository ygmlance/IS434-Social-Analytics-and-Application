Day 51 Circuit breaker.
Made croutons from my excess crust that I trimmed out earlier on for making my Sardine puff.
Very easy.
I goggle for the steps.
They used butter or olive oil.
I only have Soya bean oil. Is ok.
Heat a pan with oil and throw in the crust and sprinkle with dried Parsley.
Stored in a container and used for soup or salad later.ðŸ˜Š
Or just snack on.
I tried snacking. It is crispy,  Very nice.
I can cut down on buying crackers and just make more of this. And I am saving bread.
Nothing is wasted. Cool ! ðŸ˜Š
