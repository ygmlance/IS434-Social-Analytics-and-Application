🍓🍒🍅🌶️🥬🥒🌽🥒🥬🌽 Who says Entertainment and events have stopped?! I know many of you are stuck at home and yet have alot of food cravings during the CB period. (I am one of them...🙄) Being an entertainer, I always aim to bring the best for my viewers, especially in any of my endorsements. So I've been thinking... Let's make the best out of the CB period!

This coming Saturday 30/05/2020, both SGFoodmarket.sg and I will be bringing you a Live show of music, shopping and Giveaways during Like & Share! Yes, you will get to win too during lucky draw!

All the FRESH food are affordable, fresh and will be delivered straight to your house - so you can sit back to enjoy the show at the comfort of your own home! 🥥🥝🍐🥦🌽🥒🥬🌶️🍅🍒🍓 To be notified of the Live show, please remember to Like and follow (CLICK) 🔔 Sgfoodmarket.sg Facebook page. 
The Live will commence this coming Saturday and Sunday, 7pm onwards! I look forward to seeing all of you guys!! Please do share around as it will be an exciting one!

一整晚的娱乐＋购物，千万不要错过哦！
就在30/5/2020，晚上7点！
