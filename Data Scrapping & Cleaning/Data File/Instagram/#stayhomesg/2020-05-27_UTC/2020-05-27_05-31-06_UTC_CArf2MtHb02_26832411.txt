Even though I can’t meet my family and friends during this Circuit Breaker, delivery and courier services made it possible! .
During this circuit breaker period, I have received so many food items and parcels from my family and friends, thank you so much! .
There are times when there are hiccups here and there, I’m really grateful when they deliver fast and on time. Kudos to you 👍🏻💖
