Circuit Breaker Day (T-5): counting down the days before the kids can be reunited with their grandparents. Ever since they saw from the balcony their grandparents drive by once to drop off food and gifts for their birthdays, they’ve been screaming (no kidding, see video) in the balcony... ‘granny (come) up’ and ‘granny grandpa come back’. Very heartbreaking to watch and hear how they miss Ah Ma and can’t wait to go to Granny’s house again. They’re  counting down n looking forward to next week. So am I. #mamamag #elliotandeliza #elliotjedidiah #elizagracelim #lockdownlife #stayhomesg
