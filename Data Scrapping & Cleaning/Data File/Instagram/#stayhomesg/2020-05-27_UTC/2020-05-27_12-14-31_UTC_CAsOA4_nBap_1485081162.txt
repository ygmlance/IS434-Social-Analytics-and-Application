Bakkwa

Bakkwa is made with a meat preservation and preparation technique originating from China

Bakkwa is very popular in Singapore and Malaysia where it is traditionally eaten during the Chinese New Year

Usually we buy this during Chinese New Year or when we visit China Town (Singapore)

Try to make this home version :) #bakkwa
