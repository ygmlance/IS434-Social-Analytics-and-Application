Hi everybody! Thank you for having been such good furiends to Chip 🐹in the past year 🗓 or so! This is my little fatty's 100th post, and he'd like to have a caption contest💥with a giveaway 🎁 to celebrate! What you have to do is:

1. Follow 🐾 my little fatty (if you haven't already been following him); 2. Like this post (of course!); 3. Produce a hilarious caption for this series of pictures (better if it's in his funky language 😂); 4. Tag two other accounts (accounts must be legitimate ☑️) along with your caption in the comments below.

This caption contest will be running until 31 May 2020, 11.59pm, and Chip will pick a pair of winners and announce the results on 01 June 2020. Each winner receive a $10 GrabFood gift card!

Ready? Lezzzgo!
