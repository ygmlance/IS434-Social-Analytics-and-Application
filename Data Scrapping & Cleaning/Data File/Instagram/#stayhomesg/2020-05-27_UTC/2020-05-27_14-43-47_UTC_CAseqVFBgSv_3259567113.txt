Spot us!!!
Us with my paternal aunts and cousins, and even my parents joining and having fun despite not able to do the normal Eid Visiting (each other)... this happened in just 2 days and all thanks to my cousin Shafiaton Sa'adah for compiling and making this a reality!

Making the best out of Quarantine/Lockdown... Missing everyone so so much!! This period is the hardest...
