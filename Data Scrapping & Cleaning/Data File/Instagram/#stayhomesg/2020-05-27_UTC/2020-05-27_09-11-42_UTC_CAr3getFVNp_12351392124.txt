Acts of worship do not only entail the act itself, but it requires a holistic approach, supplemented with good deeds, character, ihsan (obtaining excellence), taqwa (piety), and rahmah (compassion). RRG Council of Elders member, Ust Sallim Jasman call upon the Muslim community to approach our ibadah with self-realization to be a good and responsible Muslim for ourselves, our parents, our neighbours and the nation.
