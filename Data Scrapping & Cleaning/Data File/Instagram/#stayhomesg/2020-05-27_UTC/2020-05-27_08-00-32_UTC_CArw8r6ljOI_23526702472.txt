Our next project showcases the refined simplicity of Arclinea's Gamma.
. 
The Gamma was created in 1970 for those who seek a luxury kitchen experience at an accessible price point. The Gamma is available in a wide selection of finishes such as glass, lacquer, and stainless steel for design flexibility. It can be mixed and matched with the other Arclinea models and accessories to derive an endless range of kitchen combinations.
