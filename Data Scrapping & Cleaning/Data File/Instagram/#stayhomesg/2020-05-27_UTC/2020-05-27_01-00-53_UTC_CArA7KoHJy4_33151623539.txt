It is desirable to take food 🥙 when the main flow of breath is through right nostril, because that is the time when the digestive glands start secreting a sufficient quantity of fluids to help digestion👩🏻‍🍳. - Yogic Treatments and Natural Remedies

If due to a change in routine, sickness..., if the proper nadii is not dominating for the appropriate activity, then that will create serious problems.🤦🏻‍♂️ #Secret_Tips
Simply lie down on your left side to let most air flow through your right nostril!👃 If the right nostril is not open while eating food then it is sure that digestion will not be proper. And that will invite the diseases👨‍⚕️ like acidity, indigestion (dyspepsia) etc. 
Our awareness of which nostril is dominating is very important. If the air does not flow primarily through the correct nostril and one realises it, then that person can do something to switch over to the dominance of the other nostril. It thus results in a positive change in our life - either physically, mentally, or spiritually.
