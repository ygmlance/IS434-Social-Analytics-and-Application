Chef-owner @nobuhiro.nishi.7 of newly-open @nishikane.sg, is the sixth-generation of a family of #Kaiseki chefs, so you bet he knows what he’s doing. And apparently, Leon (@uncle_lim_chiak) knows what he is doing too because so far, his choices of food to send me have been unerringly accurate to my taste.
This time, besides the incredible Saba Sushi-Bo which I’ve already posted about, he picked Chef Nobu’s Signature Nodoguro Uni Donabe ($100, good for 2 pax). I would describe it as sublimely done premium comfort food that compels you to sigh deeply with happiness when you eat it.
Because it’s cooked in a traditional Japanese claypot over high heat, the seasoned rice is perfumed with smokiness as well as the infusion of oils and the flavours of the #Nodoguro (Black Throat Perch), rendering it deeply delicious. Over it is spread shredded flesh of the fish, before gloriously creamy tongues of golden Uni are carefully placed (by the way, Leon revealed he had paid extra for us to have more #Uni to enjoy, so what’s shown in my video is not quite the standard order).
I found this dish stupendous not just for its marvelous taste but also because of well it travelled. Furthermore, the packaging of natural materials was simple but ingenious and chic.
