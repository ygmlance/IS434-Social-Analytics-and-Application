Day 51 Circuit breaker dinner.
My first time used thermal cooker to cook rice.
I cooked a simple two ingredients rice with my organic barley & brown rice. Added cabbages and cranberries.
The dried cranberries really can enhanced the taste of the rice. It gives a sweetness and flavours it. Nice.
Eat with some tomatoes,  egg & my morning left over Sardines from making breakfast.
