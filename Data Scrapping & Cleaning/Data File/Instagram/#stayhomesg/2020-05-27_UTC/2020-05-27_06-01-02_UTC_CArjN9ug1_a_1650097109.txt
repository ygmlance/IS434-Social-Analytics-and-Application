While working on Library for Shadows at @artgardenmadi last year, I spent an afternoon on the front porch of an old kampong house. The lady who lived there told me about a watch given to her by her late husband. She said she loved it, but never wore it because she was afraid she would loose it while working at the plantation. It rained that day. She brought out bowls of the best fried banana chips I’ve ever eaten, and I took this photo of her by the doorway before I left. ⁠
