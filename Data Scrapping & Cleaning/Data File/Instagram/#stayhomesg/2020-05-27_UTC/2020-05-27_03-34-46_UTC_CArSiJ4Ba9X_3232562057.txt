How is everyone coping with circuit breaker? We are down to the last few days but for most of us it will probably still feel the same even after we transit into phase 1.

Although I cannot take in orders, that doesn't mean my hands have to stop! I have been trying out new crafts and I'm sure the wall in my room will soon be filled.

This cactus will be opened for order once we resume business! ðŸŒµðŸŒµðŸŒµ
