I’ve seen @graincomsg for a while now and one of my friends also constantly orders from them and I always wondered what the hype about grain was and my lovely friend @megan.cheah sent this over and damn,,,, it was soooo good
.
This is the Grilled Farm Fresh Chicken Bowl - 9/10 for their grain bowl !! It was legit sooo good, the chicken was just a tad too salty for my liking but everything else exceeded my expectations :D Would like to give special mention to their very well marinated chicken. Not sure if you guys have experienced this before but sometimes when places cook chicken meat (whether breast or thigh), the outside tends to be seasoned well but once you get to the inside, it’s absolutely tasteless… and sometimes, it’s dry and tough as well. but grain’s chicken was well-marinated inside and out and soooooo tender. PLUS, their portions are really generous
.
Their pesto was yummy - fun fact, I stay away from pesto because the first time I tried it, it was @40handscoffee ’s pesto chicken panini and the pesto was soooo oily, the sandwich was literally drenched in oil and I just had the assumption that pesto wouldn’t taste good but grain proved me wrong
.
Their sweet potato fries were soggy when they came - which has been the case for all the food deliveries so it’s definitely not their fault. Tossed the fries into the air fryer but unfortunately they didn’t become crispy :( anyways, the sweet potato fries were decent !! Although you can probably give it a miss (@hansimglueck_singapore ‘s sweet ptt fries r way better)
.
overall verdict? it’s hands down a #ggmusttry .
