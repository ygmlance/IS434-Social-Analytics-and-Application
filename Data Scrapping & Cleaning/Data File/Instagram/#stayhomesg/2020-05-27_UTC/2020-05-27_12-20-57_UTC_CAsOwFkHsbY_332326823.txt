Thanks to everyone who ordered the Maple Bacon Burger over lunch, hope you enjoyed the Mentaiko upgrade 🙏🏻. We’ll be back with more promotions, including the launch of a new set this weekend that we’re pretty excited about 🎉

In the meantime, we leave you with a pic of our Chili Crab Pasta which we think is pretty fabulous. The chili crab pasta sauce is legit spicy 🌶, no watered-down sweet tomato sauces here. And we level it up by topping the dish off with an entire crispy soft-shell crab 🦀

Taste why this has been one of our best-selling pastas for years by ordering at www.grub.com.sg/delivery or dropping us a whatsapp at 88-91-92-98. 
Make your lunch tomorrow a 🌶🦀🍝!
