Cranberry loaf cake on this hazy afternoon ,#teafortwo . Have not been baking this cake for years n luckily it comes out really good from oven . The texture is  soft inside n crispy on the outside when eaten warm. Can't resist  eating another piece although got to count my calories. #homecooked  #homebake #stayhealthy #stayhomesg #staysafe
