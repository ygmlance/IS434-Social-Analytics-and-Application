LUNCH
🍝 Pasta Feast: Our favorite choice is their Truffle Mushroom follow by Tom Yum Seafood which is more savory and plus hint of heat in it
.
👍🏻 Bonus Point
- spaghetti and sauce are separately to maintain the quality of the food
.
.
DESSERT
- custard cream puffs made my cousin @peachymylovebird - assorted waffle ice cream; I 💕 the yam and durian flavour
