These days, the evenings along this busy stretch of road isn't how it used to be. 
Since most of the people working from home, the streets in the CBD nowadays are unusually quiet with only a handful of vehicles around. The majority of people who are still on the roads are the food delivery heroes who are working hard to get your lunch or dinner to your doorsteps.

I wonder if this stretch of road would still be as busy once this whole situation is over since most companies would have experienced the effects of working-from-home. For all you know, this might just be a common practice moving forward!
