â˜†Complimentary Zoom Workshopâ˜†
With every Heart In Hand Atelier Starter Kit purchased, you can redeem a free 2 hr Zoom Workshop: Introduction to Japanese Pastel Art.

Elated to have Doreen, Kyra & Kaitlin along with Sharlize, Sharmaine and Sharlene join me this afternoon as we spent 2 hours learning the basic techniques of pastel art and created these beautiful bookmarks! While the design looks deceptively simple, these basic techniques do need time and repeated practice to achieve the natural gradient and smoothness in colour blending. As I always emphasise to all participants - this is not about mastery or perfection but understanding of concept and making tonnes of mistakes is important!

Thank you for a great 2hrs and see you on Friday for our Unicorn Divine workshop!!!!
