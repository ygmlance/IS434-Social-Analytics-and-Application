It absolutely disgusts me how prevalent racism is. Why haven’t we evolved past this already?! The increase in racist hate crimes committed is appalling - Asians being spat on, physically and/or verbally attacked, treated poorly, etc. This is not ok. Hate is a virus!⁣

Furthermore, this morning, I watched the footage of what happened to George Floyd. It brought me to tears. I was infuriated. Unfortunately, this isn’t a one-off case of racist, unjustified violence and killing of African American people. ⁣

Sean Reed.⁣
Breonna Taylor.⁣
Ahmaud Arbery. ⁣
Countless others… ⁣

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Let’s talk about this. Let’s bring awareness to this. Let’s spread love, kindness, understanding, support, and knowledge. ⁣
⁣
We are all human. We are all made up of the same things. Skin colour means nothing! We are equal. We all matter. ⁣
⁣
I don’t want to keep praying “Rest In Peace” to those who have been victims of racism and brutally killed unlawfully for no reason. No. Let’s be the change so people of colour can LIVE IN PEACE!! xx
