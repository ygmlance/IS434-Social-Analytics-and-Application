Requested by @ina_fransiska yesterday sorry I learnt it after seeing your request but forgot to play it in the live so here it is XD hope you like it! I think the video is laggy because my phone memory is almost used up😐 This week's live had so many modulations lol it sounds good but so annoying sometimes 😆 but I think because of that, I can pick up the modulations faster so it's good training haha. I'll try recording covers of what I learnt for the live so I don't forget them! honestly preparing for the live has been fun but quite tiring. I start by listening around 40 songs in that theme and then attempt to play it. And I have never tried playing most of the songs before. So it shows how little I am playing apart from the chinese pop genre 😬 I guess the live was a really good thing, I made myself learn more songs!
