Tried making some 小馒头 (Tamago Boro, or 🐣 egg biscuits). Loved this as a child (now too), those little balls of sweet pillowy cloud that melts in your mouth 🤤😌. I don't know why my version looks so mutated and puffed up 🙄. Is it because my oven too hot or my fat fingers rolled them too big 🤔? Was super impatient to roll them into tiny balls, so had them a little bigger, and they didn't crisp up inside and tasted so weird 😩. I'll experiment them again hopefully (see when I eat full nothing to do 🙌🏻)? #小馒头 #tamagoboro #eggbiscuit #sgbakes #sgbaker #bakersofsgp #sghomecook #sgfooddiary #sgfoodbloggers #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodblog #sgfoodstagram #sgfoodgram #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodlover #sgigfood #sgigfoodies #igsgfood #igsgfoodies #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #sgmakandiary #sgmakan #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg
