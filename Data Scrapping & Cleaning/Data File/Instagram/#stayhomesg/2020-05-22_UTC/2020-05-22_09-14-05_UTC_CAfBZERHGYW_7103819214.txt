A great murtabak is one that is generously filled. The murtabak from @srisunexpress has a great dough to fillings ratio. Normally we only tried them for breakfast food so it was the first for us to order murtabak for iftar and it is definitely going into our favourites list! Better than some popular places 🙄 the city is know for. Give their murtabak a try if you have not cause this was a lovely finding for us and its a keeper 👍👍👍👍👍 #Iftargram #StayHomeSg #Covid19Eats #StayHomeForSG #Ramadan2020
