Laksa Pizza 🍕, $25 from 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐥𝐲 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝.⠀
⠀
We personally prefer thin crispy crusts pizza compared to the usual thick ones. Another pizza that made to our list is  𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐥𝐲 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝’s Pizza. Their pizza is what we are looking for.. thin crust like biscuit, topped generously with ingredients! Laksa fans should try this out... laksa in another form, it’s an amazing fusion dish which would get you hooked! The pizza is infused with the right amount of laksa taste, that’s not too overwhelming. Scattered generously with laksa ingredients like fish cake, hard boiled egg, squid, clams, prawn and laksa leaves! Happy Food for #TGIF! ⠀
