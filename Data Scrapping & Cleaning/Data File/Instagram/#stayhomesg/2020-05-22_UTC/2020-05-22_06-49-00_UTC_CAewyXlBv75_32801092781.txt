Circuit breaker Day 46: Banh mi 👍👍👍 🥖 My fav banh mi in SG! Crusty, home made baguettes; thick sliced veggies & flavourful meats. Each banh mi cost $5, quite substantial & super worth it esp when it’s located in the CBD! Really like the BBQ lemongrass chicken, although the roasted pork & meatball ones were good too. The crunch of the preserved carrot/radish is wonderful.
📍Bami Express (Tanjong Pagar)
