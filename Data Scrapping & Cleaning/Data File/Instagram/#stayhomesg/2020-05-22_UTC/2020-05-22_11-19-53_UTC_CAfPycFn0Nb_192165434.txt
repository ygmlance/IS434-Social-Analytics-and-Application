Circuit Breaker Fridays are my favourite time of the week with a packed schedule focused on my consultants' career growth from AM to PM. 
Proper onboarding of a new consultant is an important process that many others tend to overlook during this CB season but I believe that this is a crucial step to build a firm foundation of technical knowledge and unwavering integrity within my agents. 
Kudos to our newest batch of consultants who have readily embraced these online trainings with me & also a big shout out to the senior agents who are working hard to adapt to the changing landscape of client meetings.
