We totally love the idea of #lookfromhome that @tracyjoyphillips kickstarted with her friends to show how fun it is to dress up even when you #stayhome.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
As Tracy shared, "Cos pink pants mean business! So ready for having fun with what I wear again, even if not leaving the house... " 💖 we totally agree that colors can lift up your mood and will incorporate that in our wardrobe 😚⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Look out for more ideas coming to you from Costina tomorrow and remember to post your choices of outfit in Girlsourced App to get help on which style to wear for the week. Pick out your favorite pieces and start your day with a smile 😄 ☀️ ⁠⠀
