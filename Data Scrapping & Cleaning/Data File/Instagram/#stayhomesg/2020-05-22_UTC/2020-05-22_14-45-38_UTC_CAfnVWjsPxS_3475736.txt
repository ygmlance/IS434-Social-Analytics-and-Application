Day 45 of circuit breaker, Leodys insists to eat by himself. All along we had been spoon feeding Leodys to prevent mess and to feed him more. Recently he started to fuss and will only start to eat when we let him eat by himself. So I got him this crab plate for him to eat by himself. Although I will worry that he do not eat much, I can see that he enjoyed eating alot more. He seemed to tell me that he had grown up. #leodys #1yearoldbaby #21monthsold #selffeeding #eatingbyhimself #growingfast #growinguptoofast #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #tahanonfriz
