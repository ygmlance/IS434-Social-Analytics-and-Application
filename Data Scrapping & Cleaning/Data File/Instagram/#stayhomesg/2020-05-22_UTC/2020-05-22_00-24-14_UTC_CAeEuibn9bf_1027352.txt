I have mentioned the #milkbuns that @sulyntan had baked for me, a couple of times now but believe me when I say these fluffy babies are truly versatile and can be enjoyed in a myriad of ways. If you’re keen at making them, you can find the recipe up on the blog she and her husband @aun_koh shares: www.chubbyhubby.net.
Previously, I had shown how it played an integral role in my egg and double-aged caviar sandwich. Here, I’m sharing how the #Kaya from @chengs27 (which Sulyn had also kindly included in her care package) seemed to meld so sensuously on the milk bun, which was in itself, terrifically fragrant. Because the artisanal Kaya needed to be kept refrigerated, it was a cold creamy thing that felt voluptuous in the mouth, rich on the palate and tantalising on the nose. It worked like a dream with those buns. Or as I can also attest, on any #bread for that matter.
