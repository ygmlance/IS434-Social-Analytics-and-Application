Something new to kickstart the weekend. Mr Raff seems to constantly able to pull out a new bottle 🍷 to surprise me😊. .
Heysen #shiraz , names after the walking trail that passes through the north facing vineyard, is exposed to the full summer sun. 
This has beautiful flavour, so smooth and easy to drink. Love it! 😍
