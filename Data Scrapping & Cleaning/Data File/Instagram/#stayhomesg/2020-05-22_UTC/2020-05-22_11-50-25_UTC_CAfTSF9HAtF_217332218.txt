🎵 Reunited and it feels so gooood || Thank you @jlfang for the matching tees. We love it. Although, Darryl took it off 5 seconds after this photo was taken and said he will wear it again when we are both not wearing it 😂🙈 Nonetheless, ‘Mini’ is thrilled that Papa is home and the videos are one for the memories. Favourite is the last one 😢😍 .
