The team at @wsingapore kindly arranged for lunch to be delivered to my home a couple of days ago. I had chosen the menu from #thekitchentablesg as my family was in the mood for Asian cuisine. These were the dishes selected for us:

1. Nasi Goreng Ibu Nana ($14nett)
2. Char Kway Teow ($14nett)
3. Hainanese Chicken Rice ($14nett)
4. Living Local Bento ($16nett)
5. Butter Chicken with Naan Bread ($14nett)
6. Grilled Chicken Satay ($12nett)
7. House-made Spring Rolls ($12nett)

From the above, I would not hesitate to recommend the #ButterChicken with Naan Bread, and the Chicken #Satay. While the former was fragrant, thick and simply delicious when enjoyed with the naan and bowl of aromatic rice, the latter was addictive for its sweetish marinade and smoky, tender meat. 
The #Wsingapore team also made arrangements to include two #cocktails from #WooBarSg ($15 nett each) in the delivery. Named the “Seaside Queen” was a concoction of plantation rum, elderflower liqueur, mangosteen syrup, freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and lemon juice. A more straightforward cocktail was the “Smack Jack” that had Jack Daniel no.7, a splash of Kahlua and mint. As in the tradition of the Woo Bar, they were pretty strong.

Delivery is free if you spend $180 and above. Should you have cravings late at night, you’ll be pleased to know they operate till ‪11:30pm‬. To explore the complete menu, do tap on the link in their bio.
