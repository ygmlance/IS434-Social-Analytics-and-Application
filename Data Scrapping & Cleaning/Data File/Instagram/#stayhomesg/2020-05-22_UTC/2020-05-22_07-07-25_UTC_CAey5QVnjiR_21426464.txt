🌼 This seems to be the only image I have of me in yellow! 🤪⁣

It’s #KindnessDay in Singapore 🇸🇬 and at a time where there’s been on-going discussion, diverse opinions and debate related to a global pandemic, it’s also been a time where I’ve seen neighbours looking out for one another, the community spirit being rekindled and businesses pivoting to service their customers, clients and partners in whatever ways they can (the same can be said about customers doing their best to rally support for their favourite local businesses!)⁣
⁣
I’m processing #kindness on a personal level. One of the things I’ve struggled with over the years with is self compassion; being kind to oneself and talking to myself as if it’s a wonderful friend or to my inner child 💓 ⁣
⁣
And one of the biggest epiphanies I’ve had over the years (and just in the last week I’m relearning the lesson again 🙃) is that to “love your neighbour as yourself” doesn’t quite work when your inner critic is raging, you’re emotionally burdened, riddled with guilt, beating yourself up or nitpicking over all your insecurities 🤦🏻‍♀️😖⁣
⁣
But when I am connected to the source of all love, when I remind myself that I am a “new creation”, that I am “wonderfully made” and re-wire my thoughts - I’ve found that I’m not only better... I am kinder as a wife, daughter, leader, friend, random stranger on the street 😝 ⁣
⁣
It is a constant work in progress and my wish for this years Kindness Day is that we would recognise that to see a kinder, compassionate and loving society - we must start within 🥰💗⁣
