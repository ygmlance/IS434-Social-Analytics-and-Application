你喜欢等待吗？
静心等待结果真的不容易。读完这本书，花了些时间反思。发现很多事情真的不能急。急起来还真的能搞砸很多事。

内心平静，则外在安然。

I fell in love with this book immediately after reading it.  We really want to read it with the children for this week's story telling session! 📖

That said, this story book has led us to doing some self-reflection and we hope parents will also come along and read with us this Saturday. 🥰

AND in case you are wondering, the story has nothing to do with religion ya? It is just 3 young monks responding differently to a seed their teacher gave them. And we will find some traces of us in each of the 3 characters' response towards the seed. Very well written book. :) See you tomorrow (23 May) at 10am! ✨

Thank you @mystorytreasury for gifting us so many books for the story telling sessions! Many children will be blessed!

It will also be shared on @familiesforlife Facebook page!
