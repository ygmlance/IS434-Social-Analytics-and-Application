Today we arrived very early to the office to hand-write these cards for our customers.
.
When we started this campaign to "Send Food💌, Send some Love❤️" , we didn't expect the response to be so overwhelming. We bought a pack of 20 cards and they were completed all within the day ! .
The most beautiful thing in this world is the loving power of the human spirit. In these tough times, we have witnessed it and these events inspires and gives us strength too. 💕

As humans we are very very small, but we are profoundly capable of very, very big things ― Stephen Hawking

Wishing everyone well in these challenging times ! Keep your head up and have faith that there will be better days ahead ! .
