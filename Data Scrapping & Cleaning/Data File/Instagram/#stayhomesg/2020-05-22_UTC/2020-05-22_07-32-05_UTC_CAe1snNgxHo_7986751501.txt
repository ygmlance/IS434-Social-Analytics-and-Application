We love the creative ways our customers are using SAKURAYA's sashimi fish slabs and platters! @lesanchef chopped them up into cubes and turned them into a gorgeous bowl of chirashi don while @sebastiansimss used the sashimi slices from our platter to make chirashi dons for the whole family. 
Another customer shared with us that she buys them uncut so she can slice it herself and make her own nigiri sushi, temaki and maki sushi. 
What's your favourite way to enjoy the sashimi from SAKURAYA?
