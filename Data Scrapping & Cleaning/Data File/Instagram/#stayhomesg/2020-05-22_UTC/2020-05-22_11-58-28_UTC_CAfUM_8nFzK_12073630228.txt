I apologise in advance for my unhealthy obsession with #theblackholedelivers but it's way too good not to sincerely rave about. I'm beginning to finally realise that their chewy, springy self-made pastas are my favourite and their fish and chips are hard to beat, too. 😙 ®️: 10/10 for this meal, especially with their 50% off deal this May! . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
