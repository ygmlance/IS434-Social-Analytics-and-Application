You can look at our banana bread from two perspectives. 1. It is lower in calories (approx by half) which means it can fit easily into your diet if you are counting your calories.
2. You can eat more of our banana bread than regular banana bread and still stick within your calorie limit. Nobody ever said no to a second helping of UP banana bread!!
