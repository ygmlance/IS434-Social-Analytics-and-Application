This #StayHome period, we hope you're not forgetting to eat well and stay healthy! This simple-looking bowl of 𝐘𝐚𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐧 𝐍𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬 陽春拉麵 may seem like nothing much - until you have your first sip of its warm, comforting broth. With lard as the star ingredient of this unassuming dish, expect to be soothed with savoury and slightly spicy notes. It's definitely one of those dishes you can count on to indulge in and properly unwind 👍🏼⁣
