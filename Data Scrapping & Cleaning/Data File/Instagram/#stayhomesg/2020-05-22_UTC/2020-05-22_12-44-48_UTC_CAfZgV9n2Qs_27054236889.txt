Ginto inspired by @reesesbookclub May pick #thehennaartist by @thealkajoshi 
Calling this 'The Jaipur'
Delicately spiced with crushed cardamom, saffron, orange liqueur and rose water. @opihrgin  seemed like the best fit ~ both with the insides and outside of the bottle ‚ù§
Serve it in a tall glass, high ball style like we did in our go to choice of drink ware from  @villeroybochsg
