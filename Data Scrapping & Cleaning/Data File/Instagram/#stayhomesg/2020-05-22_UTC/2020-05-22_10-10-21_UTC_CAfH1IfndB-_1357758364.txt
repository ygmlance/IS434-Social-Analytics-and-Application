Calling all comic / manga fans! We are conducting online comic classes next week (Monday to Friday 2pm - 3:30pm) via zoom. Through the lesson, participants (6 years - adults) will create their very own comic strip by storyline building and character forming. If you are worried you wonâ€™t have enough art materials at home to join this class, fret not. Making art does not necessarily require elaborated art supplies. We have planned it in a way that you will be using things that are easily accessible at home. All you need is pencil, paper, black ink pen and black marker. Contact us to book your class!
