You know its a Hai Di Lao hotpot kinda day when the heavens are crying! 😁😁😁 Used our handy #haidilao mala soup base today for that mouth-watering punch, with ingredients we could find from the fridge. We also ate at the induction stove so that we could enjoy the breeze & view from our service yard (not to mention less washing 🤣).

SmartyPence Tip 💡 
Recreating the Hai Di Lao experience at home with the packaged soup bases that you can get from all major supermarkets.

These hai di lao soup bases are super affordable at about $4 per pack & are enough for 2 pax. Combine more packets if your family is bigger. I was initially skeptical that it would taste similar to the ones in the restaurant but it tastes EXACTLY the same! Best part, you add your own ingredients to your liking at a much lower cost per stalk of veggie 💸
I love the Tomato, spicy mala soup base & stir-fry mala ones 😋  #stayhomesg #circuitbreaker #sgunited #sgsavings #bubbleteasg #savingmoney #circuitbreakersg #bubbletea #saving #howtosave #sgfoodies #sgfood #sgfoodie #whati8today #stayhomeforsg #sghomecooking #haidilao
