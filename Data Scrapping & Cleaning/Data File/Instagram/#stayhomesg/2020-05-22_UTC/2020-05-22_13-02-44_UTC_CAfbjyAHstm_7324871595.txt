Haven’t posted a bouquet in some time, so here’s one that I just completed! ❤️ This one is really unique because there are hardly any greens. Love the bright pink roses and white lilies (at least that’s what I think they are haha)! ☺️ Also, this is a bouquet from a wedding in 2013!! Wonder if I’ll get to stitch bouquets from years back, maybe even from the 1900s 😍 #ildbouquets
