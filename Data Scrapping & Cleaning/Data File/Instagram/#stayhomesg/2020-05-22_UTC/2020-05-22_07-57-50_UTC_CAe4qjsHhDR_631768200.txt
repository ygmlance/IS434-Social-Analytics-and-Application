Day 46 Circuit breaker tea break.
Jump on the bandwagon with the rest of Singaporean who try this out first time.
Homemade Muah Chee.
This is a one serving portion.
I used the Herbal life protein shake scoop to measure.
It is a 26.5cc scoop.
1 scoop of water & 1 scoop of Glutinous flour.
Very sticky like cooking glue kind of experience. 😁
Thank god this is just a small portion.
Easier of course ! 
If you are cooking a bigger portion you better have the patience. Or better still grab a chair or stool and sit down and slowly cook.
Even better way is to use the rice cooker.😁 #jasmine_homecooked #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithst
