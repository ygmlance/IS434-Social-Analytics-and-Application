Now this is the genealogy of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood. The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. From these the coastland peoples of the Gentiles were separated into their lands, everyone according to his language, according to their families, into their nations. 
These were the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands and in their nations. 
These were the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, according to their nations. 
Genesis 10:1‭-‬5‭, ‬20‭, ‬31 NKJV
