Spent most of last year being preggie and have lots that I want to accomplish this year. But covid and looking after a baby full time have thwart all plans. This meant having to look back at my resolution list at the beginning of the year and tweak it so that it is still achievable this year. Looks like it's a year to focus on personal well-being and picking up new hobbies!
