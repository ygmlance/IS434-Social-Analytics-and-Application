It's me and my dainty kueh salat.

Mighty pleased with this first attempt. Edible, fragrant, no artificial flavouring used, lots of pandan leaves killed. Already know what changes I will make to the recipe so I am excited to do it again.

Also, decided to halve recipes from now on because in our household, we don't bake/make food to eat. For me, it's more like playing & learning & trying to see where my limits are. (So yes, I'm 10000% guilty af🤦🏻‍♀️) .
