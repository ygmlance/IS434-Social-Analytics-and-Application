Day 46 Circuit breaker dinner.
Rainy day eat porridge is very shiok.
Organic brown rice barley sweet potatoes porridge with tomatoes & shiitake mushrooms. 
Steamed 2 eggs 水蒸蛋。
The dried parsley bottle cover had a hold that is too big. I was a bit too fast and ended up with an ugly egg. I try to cover up by making a face. Add the fried shallots as the hair. 😁
I used my thermal cooker to  cook this porridge again. Two portion.
Tomorrow is a vegetarian day again.
I can save it for breakfast or lunch. Hope to get some You Tiao 油条 or go with a canned of braised peanuts.
