a little special request for our customerâ€™s bulk order was to have our bakes in a gift bagðŸ’¼ heh. Sourced for some and found one that they were good with!

Havenâ€™t really found any boxes that I like for our own gift box packaging.. ðŸ“¦kinda have one in mind but.. the sizes donâ€™t match :( so Iâ€™ll still be looking/sourcing for them.

and.. weâ€™re currently out of brownies till 28th May, drop us a DM for pre orders. Blondies and Crumble Muffins are still available for Delivery/Self Collection @ Simei MRT Station ðŸ˜Œ
