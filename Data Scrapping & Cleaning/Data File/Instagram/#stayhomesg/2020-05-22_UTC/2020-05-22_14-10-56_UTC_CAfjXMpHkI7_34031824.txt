Because my kids is sick for rice....
Does anyone feel me too!
So I cook ramen for them using my own style...
I using pork bone to boil and add in 1 packet of japan 'DASHI' soup to cook the ramen by adding some pork belly and seaweed in....not to forget adding some mushroom powder to sweeten the soup base from @liloikanbilis . .
