Very happy with my breakfast from @gathershop.co today! I really wanted to try Bordier Butter and see what the hype was about, and their crepes came with it. It turned out to be very velvety and fragrant, perfect with the plain crepes. 🤤 Their coffee and bakes were top-notch too. I got the chocolate banana bread, sour cherry and matcha friands.👍🏻 #supportfnbsg
