Salam Everyone! ⠀
It has been quite sometime since I last posted and held a henna cone. I hope everyone has been well and safe at home. ⠀
⠀
We are entering the 30th Ramadan and it’s coming to an end 😭 Decided to pick up my henna cone and do a quick draw inspired by @khairhenna. This is what it feels like. I really miss henna therapy :’)⠀
⠀
It’s going to take me some time to readjust my schedule and have henna time as I’m officially going to start my full time job real soon 🩺💊💉 I will still be around 🥰😉 Thank you for your love and support ! ⠀
⠀
Here’s my Henna for EID? Are you EID-READY?! Stay safe tooo lovelies ❤️ ⠀
