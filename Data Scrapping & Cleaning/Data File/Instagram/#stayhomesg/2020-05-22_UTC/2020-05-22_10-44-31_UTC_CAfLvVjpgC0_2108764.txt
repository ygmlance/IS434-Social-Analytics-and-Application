Dreaming of ... when I can meet my friends for cake and coffee 🥺✨🍰
.
Missing my girlfriends!!! All the boys at home is driving me 🥜~ always 3 against 1!!! 🤣 #ithoughtimthequeen 😏😌
.
So I set up a girly tea session with @nowbakerysg’s Signature blancmange rolls and Hokkaido Cupcakes 🧁with me, myself and I truly. 😌 Elroy said it was his toy cat’s birthday, #okaycan 🎂
.
@nowbakerysg’s now offers delivery and their surprise sets (like, #omakase!) are going at a steal ❤️ (as seen here) I like the Coffee slice, Pandan cake and if coz, the blancmange! It’s really not too sweet so the boys enjoyed it - and every item is carefully curated with no flavoring, no coloring or preservatives 👍🏻 I love how light the cakes are ~ definitely 💯 approved for the family in my books! ✨
.
Washing all these sinful treats down with @mosancoofficial Rose Tea 🍵, a functional tea that is designed to promote healthy carbohydrate absorption after meals and desserts. Proudly a #localbusiness too! #supportlocal 💯 Use SUGAR73 for 20% off all teas!
.
PS I need to go on a diet 😌
