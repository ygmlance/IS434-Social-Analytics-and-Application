After doing the Hati Babi Bungkus the other day, I had quite alot of pig's caul left in the refrigerator so I decided to make good use of them and make another dish which is equally awesome. This will probably be more to the liking of those who do not take pig's liver.

Deep Fried Meat Rolls (using pig's caul as the skin) served with sambal belacan and pickled mustard green
