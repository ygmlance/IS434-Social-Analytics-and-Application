Have you got sweet tooth like us and missing all the cakes and stuff? Well here's something that you might wanna try. Don't say bojio.

I am such a mountain tortoise and this is our first time trying a Basque Cheesecake! I even had to google what it was and how to pronounce it. Even though no $10k prize money lah.

But hor, it is really very nice. Love the taste and it does not feel as 'jelak' as your usual Ang Moh cheesecake, nor as 'fluffy and light' as the Japanese ones. Machiam in between lah. Thank for sending it over @cakedwithlovesg!
