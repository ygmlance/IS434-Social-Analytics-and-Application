Today’s lunch. Made salami prata pizza 🍕 inspired by chefs online! And everything also add in salad. Consisting of feta cheese, kiwi, a can of chickpeas, red onion and cherry tomatoes! Tossed with honey yogurt, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper, lime juice and lemon olive oil. 😸😸 Fun to make and fun to eat! The hubs @jakoteo liked it! Have a Blessed day guys! ❤️❤️ #rubycookingjourney #homemade #salad #pratapizza #stayhomesg #stayhome
