10 more days to the end of CCB and into Phase 1 of re-opening our economy...
This stay-home period requires CREATIVITY and DISCIPLINE.
I draw up time-tables daily so the 3 little ones know when and what to do. From schoolwork, revision, play, free-time, piano practice, exercise time to family activities, they know what to expect and will not feel lost. The time-tables also create ‚Äúme-time‚Äù for @jaylimsays  and I, without being interrupted constantly. 
This CCB brings us time for reflection and helps many of us to realize the simplicity of happiness. We discover the various talents in our little ones, from sketching, paper craft, dominos-building and even bean-growing!üôÇ
These pictures will remind me, in time to come, how we got through this adversity together. ‚ù§Ô∏è #covid19circuitbreaker #sgunited #maskup #stayhomesg #staysafestayhome #homeactivities #bebetterthanyesterday #treasurethemoments #creatingmemories #clarelyx #joshualyz #jacoblyh #cherylhotraveldiary #sgmummy #motherof3 #familylifeambassador #mrssingaporeuniverse2014
