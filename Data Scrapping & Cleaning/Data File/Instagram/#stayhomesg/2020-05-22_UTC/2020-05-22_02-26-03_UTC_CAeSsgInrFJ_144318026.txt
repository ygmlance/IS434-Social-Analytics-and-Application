Hubs always thinks in advance for the family. Today we're all masking up for the day to have a feel of how it will be like when school reopens. 
To teach them how to handle their masks, pull down or keep in their pockets for breaks. To get used to wearing it so that we won't complain and get distracted when the time comes soon!
I am feeling the heat already. Let's be prepared and press on together Singapore!ðŸ’ª
