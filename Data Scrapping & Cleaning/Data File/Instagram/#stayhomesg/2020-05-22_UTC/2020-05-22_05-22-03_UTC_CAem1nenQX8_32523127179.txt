😋Taste: 8/10. Straightforward home cooking that’s flavourful and heartwarming. Particularly happy with the braise of the chicken and root vegetables. Not a perfect 10 as some found the noodles a little too oily. Nonetheless, after rotating through cuisines inspired by other cultures, it’s always nice to return to something nostalgic ☺️
