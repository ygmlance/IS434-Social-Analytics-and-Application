While cleaning our home, I re-discovered a bookmark from #PenangButterflyFarm (that has now transformed into entopia, tickets 13 years & above RM69, 4 to 12 years old RM49, remember to check for deals when we are visiting it in the near future). It is a nice bookmark that allows our children to learn life cycle. Towards the end of 2019, I planned to bring my children to explore more natural sites in Singapore to appreciate nature including the more affordable Sentosa (@sentosa_island) Butterfly Park & Insect Kingdom (> 13 years old $14.40, child $9) during the 2020 school holiday, but we are now learning about #butterfly at home. On 22-May-2020, our children also listened to a story "The VERY Impatient Caterpillar" By Ross Burach available from (1) #publicLibrariesSG (2) https://youtu.be/-iSoF5BiV1w or (3) https://youtu.be/qouWb5g__PQ | #ThankYouTeachers #ThankYouWriters #ThankYouStorytellers | I also remember (i) a quote from #StillAlice by @authorlisagenova “She liked being reminded of butterflies. She remembered being six or seven and crying over the fates of the butterflies in her yard after learning that they lived for only a few days. Her mother had comforted her and told her not to be sad for the butterflies, that just because their lives were short didn't mean they were tragic. Watching them flying in the warm sun among the daisies in their garden, her mother had said to her, see, they have a #beautifullife. Alice liked remembering that.” and (ii) my late father who passed away from #lungcancer in spite of having never smoked any tobacco, his grandchildren are missing him dearly. #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #TobaccoExposed #WorldNoTobaccoDay https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
