ðŸŽµ AN ODE TO BUBBLE TEA ðŸŽµ
(For all you bubble tea lovers out there, this oneâ€™s for you.) ðŸ’š

O boba tea, O boba tea,
The next few weeks will be so lonely.

Without your small chewy balls,
How do I get through the endless Zoom calls?

O boba tea, O boba tea,
Who will fill this space you left in my tummy!

You were a drink and a snack,
A dessert, a treat, a pat on my back.

O boba tea, O boba tea,
What else could make me feel less empty?
