Circuit Breaker Day... 🤔? Every Tuesday morning Zoom yoga with my A+mazing teacher @denjzng 
New poses today- I did not expect to backbend so early😧 But on a positive note, the poses helped to warm up my body for self practice after class. Try to find the positives in a bleak situation. Is called rewiring the brain 🙏
