Week 4 has officially kicked in, Singapore! I hope youâ€™re doing A-okay at home ðŸ’•

Iâ€™ve been enjoying all the Live sessions here since the start of #circuitbreaker and they are here to stay.

Mon 6pm - Pilates
Wed 6.04pm - Nike Community Workout
Fri 6pm - Kettlebell x Pilates .

If youâ€™ve enjoyed working out with me so far, Iâ€™ve got more for you. To keep you & me going, thereâ€™ll be weekly virtual workout sessions on Zoom starting in May. Choose between HIIT, Pilates or P-HIIT to get your heartrate up, break a sweat, stretch & shape up. Each class will cost between SGD5-12, free for frontliners. Friday is our starting point so get hustling. DM for schedule & more details!

If youâ€™re looking for online personal training & nutrition guidance, or you simply want lasting results to get in shape & have more energy, youâ€™re on the right page. Drop me a DM to have a chat with me or check out https://procoach.app/wany-misban to get started. Time is always on your side. Just do it.
