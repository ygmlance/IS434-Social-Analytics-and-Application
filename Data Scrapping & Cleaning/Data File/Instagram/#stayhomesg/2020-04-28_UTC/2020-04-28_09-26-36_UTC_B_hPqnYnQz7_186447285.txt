Some metronome evenings. 
5 min x 138bpm
5 min x 148bpm 
5 min x 158bpm 
no accents, no crescendo, no nothing. you may call this a helicopter set. 
and i choose to do this after a 30 min yoga strength training session. 手臂整个爆掉. lost my bearings towards to the end of 158. 
no, that’s not a drum stick. cause #circuitbreaker everything must #makeshift right. 
#蓉蓉自主训练 
#才不是自主
