Circuit breaker day 22: Tom yum seafood soup for lunch.👩‍🍳
🔸️
Bought the sliced seabass from @haisiaseafood which were pretty good and the noodles were called 刷刷米粉 which I bought from Genting a few months' back. The combi worked well for me and I am belly-happy now 🥰

Just out of curiosity, do we need to wear a mask to step out for seconds to clear our waste? 🤔
