Here's my week 2 progress of my splits endeavour! ü§∏‚Å†
‚Å†
Well, I think the angle of my legs are still pretty much the same, but I could bend down a little more. My arms are now at an angle, instead of being perpendicular against the floor.‚Å†
‚Å†
Not sure if I'll achieve the splits by end of the lockdown, but we'll see!‚Å†
‚Å†
How are y'all doing? ‚Å†
