Lemon | Blueberry | Yogurt 🍋🍞
.
🍴Overall ease: 7/10
.
🛒Ingredients: 140g flour, 150g yogurt, 60g sugar, 60ml canola oil, 3 small eggs, 1.5tbsp lemon zest, 1.5tsp baking powder, 0.75tsp vanilla essence, 0.3tsp salt, 160g blueberries for the loaf + 60ml lemon juice & 0.75tbsp sugar for a pour-over lemon syrup (adapted from @jocooks for a 5 cup loaf pan)
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: whisk together all the ingredients before folding in blueberries coated with flour (to prevent them from sinking). Pop it in the oven at 180deg for 50min-1hr and pour over the lemon syrup
.
😋Taste: 6/10. After cutting the sugar by >1/2 of the original recipe, we loved the final product’s taste of blueberry & yogurt paired with sour-sweetness of the lemon syrup. Gotta admit that it was more like custard than cake, probably due to overwhisking and too much egg (?). Would love to try again to perfect the texture, but definitely in love with the flavour profile!
