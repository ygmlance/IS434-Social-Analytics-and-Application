Juggling #HBL and #WFM. There are great days. And there are disastrous ones. I usually start my day ready to conquer a long to-do list. Then the enthusiasm gets thrown out of the window as I quickly assume the roles of tech support, cheerleader, and interpreter for my 7 yr old and 5 yr old. By noon, I would have missed dozens of emails and messages. 😰 When it's time to catch up on those, I would be in calls and virtual meetings instead. Then it's a round of having to respond to the children's varied requests and/or breaking up fights. Before I know it, it's the end of the day. Time to give undivided attention to work, as I work late into the night. I struggled initially but now have accepted this new way of working. In fact I'm loving it! Above it all, very thankful to have "co-workers" - husband and super-helper Melba - who are star players ⭐ keeping this household such a happy place during this Circuit Breaker! 💪💪💪 to all working mums out there!
