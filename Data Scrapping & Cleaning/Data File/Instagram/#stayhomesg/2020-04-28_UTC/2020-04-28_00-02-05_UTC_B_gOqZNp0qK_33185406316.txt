Something â€˜awwâ€™ to brighten up your Tue morn! ðŸ˜Š This dog was so happy that everyone is home for quarantine, that his tail has stopped working, so the owners went to the vet and the vet said â€˜he had sprained his tail from excessively wagging itâ€™ ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’” Heâ€™s all better now though as you can see! #Hearts4SG #StayhomeforSG #StayhomeSG #coronacation #coronavirus
