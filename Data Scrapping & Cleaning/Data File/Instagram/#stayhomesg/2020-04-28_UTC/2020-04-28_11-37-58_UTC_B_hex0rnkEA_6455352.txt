My family love herbal jelly! #龟苓膏 i do not think it is the same as the grass jelly. But some does.. Anyway, I did not make it from scratch but i love just how convenient it is now! Last time we have to boil the heck of it to make it.. fresh made herbal jelly in an instance!

Just follow the packaging instruction and let it set! 
However, i did add monk fruit to the boiling water before hand as a natural sweetener. This adds to the “cooling” aspect if it.
