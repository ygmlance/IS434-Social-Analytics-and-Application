Peranakan Chicken Stew 
I was chatting with my friend yesterday about about what's on my cooking list today. 
He told me he had only had this dish once last year after his mother passed on in 1989. Wow! That was 30 years ago!

I decided to cook this Stay Home dish for lunch today during our Covid-19 Circuit Breaker.  Hope it will turn out tasting like what his mother did and bring back some memories to warm his stomach and heart.
