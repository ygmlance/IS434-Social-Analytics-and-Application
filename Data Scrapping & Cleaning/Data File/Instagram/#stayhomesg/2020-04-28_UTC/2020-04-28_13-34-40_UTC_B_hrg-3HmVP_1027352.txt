It’s been a while since my dinner at @AmoRestaurantSG with @liltune and her daughter but I do recall enjoying our meal there. Thanks to @lylatheeatgirl, I got to try Amò’s Takeaway Menu last night and I must say, the food managed to actually outdo what I‘d filed away in my memory.
Arriving in great shape was the Crispy Calamari ($22.50), its battered coating retaining the all-important crunch. It was extra delicious swiped through the Sumac and Sundried Tomato Aioli. 
The Caserecce was a stunner ($28.90). Cooked with black pepper and strips of Guanciale in an astonishingly fragrant Saffron sauce, it was like no #pasta I’d eaten before. And I wasn’t the only one smittened. My family members couldn’t stop raving about it too.
Another recipient of much praise from around the table was the Butter Roasted Spring Chicken with Rosemary Jus, Roman Potatoes and Baby Spinach ($37.45). While the petite chicken captivated with its deeply flavourful and juicy meat, the thin slices of soft potatoes and crisp salad leaves played to their strengths and contributed significantly to the overall enjoyment. 
The pizzas had a light and chewy crust, and the topping variations selected for us did not disappoint. I was especially taken with the combo of Broccolini, Pancetta, Pumpkin and Smoked Mozzarella ($29.95), and thought the splash of aged balsamic vinegar on it, brilliant.
More classic in taste profile but quite sophisticated at the same time was the more “sauce-y” #pizza that had Stracciatella, Prosciutto, Rucola and Fig Vincotto arranged on the crust ($34.25). It went down really well with everyone else.
