Ever since circuit breaker started, I have mostly woken up, craving for all kinds of food and todayâ€™s craving is tonkatsu!

Monster Curry is my go to place for pork katsu, since it is relatively affordable. Tender, succulent and THICC pieces of pork beneath its crispy skin, and the best part is each slice had a 1:1 meat to fat ratio. The curry is also thick, salty and flavourful. Each component then comes together to make every bite satisfying!

Definitely pleased with my stay home meal today even though itâ€™s nothing special!!ðŸ˜‹
