In this unusual times of the world,  no one prefer to be out there at the front-line if one can help it. 
If not for a living, if not for the bills,  if not for the comfort of our customers who HAVE to stay at home,  we would not be out there risking possibilities unless necessary. 
Live and Let Live! 
To Our Customers THANK YOU,  for being so sweet to us whenever we are in your homes to do what we do best ~ quickly & well! ðŸ˜˜
