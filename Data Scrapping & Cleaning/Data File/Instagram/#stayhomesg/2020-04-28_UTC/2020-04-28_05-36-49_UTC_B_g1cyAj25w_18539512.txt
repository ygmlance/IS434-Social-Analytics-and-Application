Throwback CB Day+20: My dinner- Hainanese style Chicken Chop, using chicken boneless drum and good old fashion crackers to make the outer crispy layer fried into golden brown; Top with Hainanese style tomato gravy on it and generous serving of potato wedges. #goodmood #hainanesefood #hainanaesechickenchop #chickenchop #chickencutlet #sgfood #sgfoodie #foodsg #localfoodsg #localfood #foodpornsg #stayhomesg #singaporeathome #singaporefood #joestoys #homecooked
