Was out running some errands this afternoon, and on way back, passed by the famous 永和豆浆 at Geylang. 
Bought some for the family, and thought of our Chinese neighbors again... they must be missing China / Taiwan styled food a lot, so I bought some for them too (the usual + some 蔥油餅 and 猪肠面线 - Chinese favorites). This time behind closed doors I could hear what they screamed in elation: “哇，咱们又有东西吃啦? 太幸福了啦！” 😂 • Cost of meal: $21.60
• Time taken for the detour: +30min • Appreciative neighbors feeling cared for: PRICELESS
