day 22 of #stayhome circuit breaker in 🇸🇬 — how is everybody doing?! 😷
.
my family remains sane (barely) & smiling (I make them. mind over matter!).
.
proud mama moment: today, I managed to not raise my voice at home. not once! a small act of mindfulness/intention paid off. 😉
.
as much as we all appreciate having family around 24/7, especially during this surreal time, (and I kinda know we will never enjoy this closeness ever again), we still manage to get underfoot and annoy one other (especially when I post on TikTok!). it’s inevitable. and just think, we only have another 33 days until 1 June. 😝
.
without a doubt, Bella is enjoying our home staycation more than anyone. 🐾
.
stay safe. don’t judge. be kind.
.
sending love to you from all of us! 😙
