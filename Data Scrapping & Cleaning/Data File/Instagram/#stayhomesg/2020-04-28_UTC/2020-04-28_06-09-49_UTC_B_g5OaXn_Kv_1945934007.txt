She is not an EXCUSE...
She is my REASON...
.
.
Tuesday’s workout was interrupted numerous times from Linnet’s home based learning hiccups until I lost count on the number of reps I do... .
.
Last set of the HIIT was completed with Linnet was a blast on day 1️⃣1️⃣9️⃣
.
.
✅ 10 minutes arm ✅ 10 minutes abs
✅ 10 minutes thighs
✅ Unrecorded interrupted workouts
.
.
It does not matter as the most important aspects are I completed my workout & enjoyed Linnet’s company too..
