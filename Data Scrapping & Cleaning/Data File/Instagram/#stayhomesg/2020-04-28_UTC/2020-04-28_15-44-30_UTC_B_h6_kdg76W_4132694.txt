Wow, what a session it was chatting with two Covid19 patients.
.
Theres so much for us to learn. Watch as they share their experiences and the struggles they are going thru.
.
One of them is warded together with her one year old as both of them are Covid19 positive ðŸ˜­
.
The other patient has been away from her 2yrs old son for more than 1 month!

Lets pray that they will recover soon and go home to their loved ones, shall we?
