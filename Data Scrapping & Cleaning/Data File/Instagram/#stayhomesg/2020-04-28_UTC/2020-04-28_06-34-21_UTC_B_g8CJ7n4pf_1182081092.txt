Have you seen some lil brown patches on your citrus recently?? Or some worms in your produces?? Your produces are actually ok ðŸ˜Š in fact they are a reassurance that your produces are organic and pesticide free. The brown spots on your oranges are actually are just the works of rust mites which only just damage the skin of the fruits. 
Well beauty is skin deep isnt it ðŸ˜Š? The essence of the fruits actually stays the same so no worries on that part!
