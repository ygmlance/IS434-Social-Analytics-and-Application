Circuit Breaker Day 22 - Nasi Padang

It been a while since I updated my instagram...been lazy and detoxing myself away from social media..haha.

We had this meal last week, and it was one of the best delivery we had for a while. The food is not only delicious and also generous. Hubby and I love HJH Maimunah's beef tripe curry and jackfruit curry, it is the nearest to the ones we had in Jakarta. I also loved the deep fried fish eggs, so sinfully yet delicious.

I ordered it in the middle of night when I could not sleep...so ended ordering more than we can finish...greediness at work. Well, the leftovers was finished at dinner, nothing was wasted.

If you have cravings for Nasi Padang, you can order it in feastbump. Oh ya, l personally like this website when ordering food delivery.
