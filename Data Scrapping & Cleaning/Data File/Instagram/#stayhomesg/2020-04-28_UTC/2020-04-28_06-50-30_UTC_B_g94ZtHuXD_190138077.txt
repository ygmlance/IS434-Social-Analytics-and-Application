❤️ sending over lots of love ❤️
.
A very sweet customer of ours @dawnlivesinthemoment sent this lovely  package over just to keep  our spirits up! How blessed we are to receive such lovely  surprises during these ambivalent times.
.
Appreciate all the lovely messages I've received the past  week to ask  how we've  been due to the lack of posting. Thank you so much  for your concern and keeping me in your thoughts. All is fine  at our end with me just  laundering all the dresses and sorting them out to post in batches.
.
If you have any preferences of any style do comment below 👇 Thank  you and look out for our dress post later today!
.
Stay home and  stay safe.
