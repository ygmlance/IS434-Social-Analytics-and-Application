#stayhomesg: No cooking, super fast to do ...
Have some left over ingredients, decided to do a super fast achar. Cut cucumber, carrot and pineapple, mixed with Thick Plum Sauce and sprinkle with peanut. For spicy version, add chilli padi. For sweeter version, sprinkle sugar. Love it sour, add fruity vinegar or freshly squeezed lime/lemon juice.
