"𝐆𝐞𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐚𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 ‘𝐖𝐞’ 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭."
Let me paint to you the picture that is happening right now in Singapore. 🖼
.
The government has set up a myriad of impressive measures, in hopes to contain the virus, and maintain the health of the economy. 🍎
.
Contact tracing, makeshift community care, proactive swab tests for dorm workers, stimulus packages, salary assistance for businesses in Singapore...
.
While all these pillars of protection are in place, can Singapore get through if some citizens continue refusing to comply? ❌
.
While the government has budgeted $60billion for our 5.6million people (Malaysia $80billion for 32.6million people), can our citizens use it wisely if they aren’t educated properly on how to use it? Or, if they continue to flout rules and end up actually giving half of it back?
.
All of which, our brave front liners are the ones really fighting this war. 🛡️🛵🏥
.
As a leader of 70 myself, I want to share with everyone that we are doing our best to support our teams. Government policies are changing at every turn. As as leaders, we must adapt together, quickly.
.
Leaders can set the new pillars in place. But if you do not act, it is also a decision to stay behind. 💨
.
I recently watched an interview of Andrew Cuomo, a politician in America, with the press. .
It's really time we got our heads around the "We" concept. 🤝🏻 Some people have asked, "is avoiding the widespread of this virus really worth this much of a downfall economically"?
.
To that, I quote Andrew Cuomo in his interview. “Economic hardship? Yes, very bad: (but it's) not death. 𝐀𝐧𝐝, 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐟 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐞𝐥𝐬𝐞."
.
Now, the choice is yours. 🖐🏻🙂 Will you be a 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦, or will you be a stumbling block?
