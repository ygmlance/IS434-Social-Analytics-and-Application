To all our essential workers with their never-ending efforts to keep Singapore safe, sending love from us at Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore.

As our favourite Singapore song goes, “This is home, surely, as my senses tell me. This is where I won’t be alone, for this is where I know it’s Home.” #shangrilasg #sgunited #home
