#quarantinephotoshoot with @lilteaspoon_51 via #googlehangouts

I remember when I first met An An a few years back on our first test shoot, we hit it off immediately when I mentioned “Faye Wong” because her whole vibe just reminds me so much of this C-pop diva (of all time) and needless to say, we shot the whole time blasting Faye Wong @spotifyasia playlist.

Faye Wong was one of the earliest singers I keenly listened to during childhood (when I was around 10/11 years old). And I believe her music and visuals have played a part in developing/shaping the creative part of me. Maybe also characteristically i.e chill, not showing enthusiasm outwardly even when I’m excited.

Am grateful for this #circuitbreakersg downtime ‘cos it has allowed me to free my mind and my time for things that make my heart beat faster.

This shoot was mostly inspired by Faye’s music from 1997-1999. From her self titled album in 1997, Sing and Play (唱遊) - the first Chinese album recorded with HDCD techniques and Lovers & Strangers (只爱陌生人). ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀
