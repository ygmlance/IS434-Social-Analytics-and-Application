We are living in unprecedented times and it is only normal to feel uneasy. Or at least, that’s for me.
Beyond the Covid19 virus, it’s also the disruption of our daily routine and future plans that unnerves. 
Is there light at the end of the tunnel? What are you working for today if you do not trust that tomorrow brings a better day? Can anyone really get comfortable with uncertainty? 
But I’ve begun to unearth good things out of this predicament - I was abroad for most part in the last couple of years. Yet now, I’ve never felt more “at home”. I almost forgot how difficult it is for me each time to leave my home and family, and lug my bike boxes around; we bought a house and I never really got to live in it. So now is the best time for me to roll on my bed, make a mess in my kitchen, sit in front of the TV with my legs up… and yes, get in the gym to lift and ride. 
Because life goes on. And you smile when the light hits your face.
