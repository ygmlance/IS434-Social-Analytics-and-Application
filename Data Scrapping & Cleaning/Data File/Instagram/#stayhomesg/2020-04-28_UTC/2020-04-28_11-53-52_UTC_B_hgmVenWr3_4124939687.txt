â™¡Spicy Sichuan Pepper Noodles w Salmonâ™¡
Yes I love anything spicy! These noodles from Tseng Noodles are so gd! Curly noodles give a very nice chewiness to each bite. Pairing it with seared salmon, chopped spinach n some added nuttiness from white sesame. .

After cooking the noodles, drain n pour the Sichuan oil pack in. Don't soak the noodles in the hot water(like me ðŸ˜‚).
