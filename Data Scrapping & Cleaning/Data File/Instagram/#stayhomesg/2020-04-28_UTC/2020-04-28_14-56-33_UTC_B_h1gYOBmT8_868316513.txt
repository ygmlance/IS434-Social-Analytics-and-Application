We are back to shine the spotlight on our many talented YTzens and what they've been up to while staying home!

It seems like there's no limit to what our YTzens can't do - sewing, playing a musical instrument and even baking, you name it and they can do it!

The beauty of this challenge is that it allows other YTzens to know how unique and special their school mates are and it is also a great way to remind everyone to continue being #sociallyresponsible so that we can keep Singapore safe ‚ù§

Just because we are staying indoors doesn't mean we can enjoy some of our favourite food! In fact our hawker aunties and uncles need us now more than ever, and thanks to technology, you can enjoy your favourite nasi lemak in the comfort of your own home! Isn' that great?

We hope everyone is keeping well and staying safe at home :) remember that when you stay indoors, you're not just keeping yourself safe, you're also keeping your loved ones and community safe.
