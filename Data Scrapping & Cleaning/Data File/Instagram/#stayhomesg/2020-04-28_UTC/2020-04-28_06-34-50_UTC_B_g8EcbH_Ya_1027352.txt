Because my brother-in-law picked up the food from #wheelersyard himself, he got a 20% discount. And that translates to a tidy amount of savings since he settled the bill for our whole family at home.
The choice of the men was the bestselling “Suki Beef Rice Bowl” ($19.90 before discount) and they very much enjoyed the sliced oyster blade steak in housemade sukiyaki sauce. It’s served with an onsen egg and braised daikon (Japanese radish) on Japanese rice embellished in shio kombu and seasame seeds. 
While my niece got the healthy “60 Degree Chicken Breast” ($18.90 before discount), a large piece of very tenderly-cooked protein on housemade potato mash accompanied by grilled butter corn, roasted hazelnuts and shio konbu, I opted for my all-time favourite, the “Vegetable Rice Bowl” ($15.90 before discount). The fresh-tasting, Japanese-inspired creation has never failed to satisfy me with its base of Japanese rice drizzled in a sweetish sauce and the silken tofu, mushrooms and assorted vegetables heaped on top. The lovely flavours and textures from the juicy “bok choy”, sweet and smoky roasted corn kernels, crisp haricots verts (they’re the skinny French beans you find mostly served at fine dining restaurants) and the aforementioned braised daikon are what I love most about it. 
My brother-in-law also added two side dishes for us to share: the very addictive beer-battered, crunchy-fried Furikake Cauliflower ($7.90 before discount) and a Glazed Sweet Potatoes that featured a housemade yuzu soy sauce ($5.90 before discount). We gobbled both of them up along with everything else in no time at all.
