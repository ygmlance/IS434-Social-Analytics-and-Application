Homemade prata from scratch! Ladies and gentleman, I am officially on Tik Tok and my kids are laughing at me for being that auntie who loads up cooking Tik Toks just for fun. 
But pray tell me my effort is worth it, documenting this fun endeavour at NOT flipping prata! Haha. 
Finally, Davidâ€™s cravings satisfied, with homemade Prata from scratch. Itâ€™s times like these that I really wanna hug my Thermomixâ€¦ The step-by-step guided cooking and inbuilt weighing scale makes it just so convenient and clean. I can tell you I wonâ€™t even bother if not for how contained the process is. Yeah I am quite a lazy cook actually. 
So here goes, staying home to flatten the curve, and to fatten our curves. ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜Ž Cheers!
