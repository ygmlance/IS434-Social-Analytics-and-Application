28 Apr 20 [#CircuitBreakerSG Day 22] :: What is the most eco-friendly way to get essentials in the shortest time?
.
TOTE BAG for this Vegatrian Boy from @3littlepicks. See? Tote bags are essential! And definitely environmentally-friendly. Please bring your own bags for your shopping okay? You can use the plastic bags from the vegetables, meat, pasta you bought as rubbish “bins”. Don’t forget to bring your own lunch boxes when you go dabao food too. I remember bringing metal tins to the coffee shop to buy fishball noodles growing up. Don’t you? .
.
MASK ON. Don’t forget to wear your mask [no reusable masks available for big man so he gotta use disposables] the moment you step foot out of your home! Even if you are going to open your letter box. We’ve got BCA coming into our grounds to check for non-compliants.
.
SPEEDY GONZALES on blades! The fastest way to get to the nearest minimart 700m from our home [and back] is to get there on wheels! Wheels that do not require petrol [Earth says Thank You]. Wheels that do not require parking. Wheels that are attached to your feet which serves as an exercising tool too. Get In Fast, Get Out Fast. I asked Meyer, “Uncle let you shop with blades ah?” He replied, “Ya leh. So good. I thought he might scold me.” Lol why are we always so worried about offending the elderly? We talk like kids! .
.
GO ALONE - that’s the directive. The rest of us waited at home for daddy’s return [even though we would love to jog, blade and cycle alongside him] with onions and cheese, potatoes and eggs to cook our favourite lunch!
.
Talking about food... WHAT TO COOK TONIGHT!?!?!?
