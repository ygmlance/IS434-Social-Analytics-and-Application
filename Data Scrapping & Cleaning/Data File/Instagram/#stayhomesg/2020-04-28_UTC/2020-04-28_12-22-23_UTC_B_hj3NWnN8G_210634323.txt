#day21 #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg This girl finds the texture of the slime interesting but she donâ€™t like to get her sticky ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ She saved 3 letters and kept. ğŸ™„ Came to find me while I work and replaced me on the seat while I cooked lunch. She enjoyed the jelly that Charisse and Chloe Jie Jie made. Last but not least, she really enjoyed the snow kid spray. Spent a good one hour or more inside recognising letters and spraying them.  Really never regret buying them. Hahahaha.
