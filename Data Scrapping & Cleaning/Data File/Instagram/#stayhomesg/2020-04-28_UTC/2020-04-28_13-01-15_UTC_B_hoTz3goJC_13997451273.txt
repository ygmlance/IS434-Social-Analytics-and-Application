We all face anger, frustration, or other unpleasant feelings. This can be a source of stress, and it can hinder us from doing daily work. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It is normal to feel that way. As a Buddhist we experience it too! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Let’s learn how to deal with these emotions the Buddhist way, as taken from the Vitakkasanthana sutta. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
May all of us be free from negative emotions and from sufferings!
