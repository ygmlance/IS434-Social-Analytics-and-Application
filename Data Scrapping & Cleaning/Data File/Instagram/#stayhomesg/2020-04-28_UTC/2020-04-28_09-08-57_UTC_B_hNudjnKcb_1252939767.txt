one of the dishes i picked up for lunch today from @sgtakayama. it’s stewed kurobuta from kagoshima and it’s OUT OF THIS WORLD! i’m a big fan of the creations that come out of @taro.chef ‘s kitchen and this dish brought back memories of his yakitori i had some years back. the pork belly he prepared then was similar, like a smoked version of what we had today. it’s uncanny how he manages to maintain the meat’s physical integrity because it just melts away at the first bite. these dishes are proof of god.
