Invitation to play!

Setting up little tasks like this set as an invitation for your child to play! It set as an invitation for him to explore and be independent in the play set up. 
This is also an example of setting up for Independent Play. :) Before AM Jr wakes up from his nap, I made some play dough and set up this on his table. I couldn't find much dough cutter now, so found some bottle caps that i have collected for him to use as cutters and a hard cardboard roll as a roller.

Dough play are excellent for developing fine motor skills and rewriting skills. If your toddler is AM Jr age, don't quickly jump into tracing cause their muscles are still developing!

Ensure that the materials are easy for child to work with when creating "Invitation to Play"

I hope it is fun for you and your child!
