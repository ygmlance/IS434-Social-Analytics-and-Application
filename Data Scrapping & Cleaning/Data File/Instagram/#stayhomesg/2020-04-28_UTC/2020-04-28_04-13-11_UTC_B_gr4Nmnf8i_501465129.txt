Thank you @sumyitai for the delicious food for our beneficiaries!! For every $25 voucher purchased, 1 meal gets donated to The Food Bank! 
Posted @withregram â€¢ @sumyitai Our first batch of meals donated to The Food Bank Singapore to help #FeedTheCity. Thank you to all of you who purchased our vouchers, on which we paid forward towards feeding the needy. We hope they enjoy our signature Mapo Tofu Rice and that you enjoyed your meal with us too!
.
Our Pay it Forward movement is ongoing. To contribute to the fight against #covid19 and to #savefnbsg at the same time, you can purchase vouchers from us and for every $25 voucher purchased, we in turn donate 1 meal to feed families displaced by this crisis
.
*Vouchers purchased have no expiry date and can be redeemed against delivery orders during the Circuit Breaker or used anytime later
