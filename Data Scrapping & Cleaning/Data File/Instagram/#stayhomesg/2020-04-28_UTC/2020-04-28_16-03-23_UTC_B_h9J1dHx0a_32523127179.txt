Linguine | Mixed Seafood 🦞🐙🦑
.
🍴Overall ease: 5/10
.
🛒Ingredients: seafood broth (lobster, prawns, carrots, onions), squid, scallops, octopus, garlic, coriander
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: gradually stockpile lobster shells and prawn heads, finally collect enough to simmer it with carrots and onions and a touch of fresh tomato sauce till it becomes an umami bomb. Stir fry squids and scallops with garlic and coriander, and add the seafood stock. Toss slightly undercooked linguine into the sauce and let residual heat do its magic. Sous vide octopus for 4 hours before grilling it on a cast iron pan. Add the octopus to take the pasta over the edge.
.
😋Taste: 11/10. Photo sucks but this was hella bombz. That is all.
