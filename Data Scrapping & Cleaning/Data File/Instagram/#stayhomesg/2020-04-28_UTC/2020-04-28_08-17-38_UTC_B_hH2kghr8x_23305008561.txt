Sometimes a wonderous aspect of birdwatching is that you will never notice some birds in our surroundings until you've noticed their existance. Which makes me wonder till today... why didn't i notice them earlier?

In view of #circuitbreakerapril , i've decided to share some photos to help get through these trying times. In each post, ill be sharing a favourite photo of a bird shot in #singapore and an interesting factoid i've observed.
