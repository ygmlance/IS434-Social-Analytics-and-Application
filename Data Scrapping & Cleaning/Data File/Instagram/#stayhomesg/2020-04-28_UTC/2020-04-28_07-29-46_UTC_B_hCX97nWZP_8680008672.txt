Staying home with no change in our environment can be a real downer on our creative juices. What are some ways you use to refresh yourself and get inspired? ⁣
⁣
For us, music always saves the day. That’s why we’ve put together a playlist recommendation in a previous post that we hope can inspire you as well! ⁣
⁣
Taking time away from work (even if you feel that you haven’t worked enough) to do things that you like can do more good than you think. ⁣
⁣
Play a few rounds of your favourite game 🎮, do some exercises (there’s so many tutorials that lets you workout at home without any equipment 💪), make a drink (Dalgona coffee anyone? ☕). ⁣
⁣
Listen to your needs and take care of it, and when you get back to work, the ideas will flow more naturally!
