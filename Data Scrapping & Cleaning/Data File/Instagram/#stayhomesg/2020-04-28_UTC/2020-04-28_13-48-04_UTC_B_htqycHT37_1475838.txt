Blooming paper flowers activity:
1) cut some flowers, use a normal printing paper (make sure it is not too thick, if not the flower will not bloom), colour them, guess which is Jie Jie, which is Mei Meiâ€™s work 
2) fold the petals gently
3) release in the water and watch it bloom
4) what not to do. The very helpful Mei Mei tried to fold, or rather, crush all the flowers after she drew on them ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #stayhomesg
