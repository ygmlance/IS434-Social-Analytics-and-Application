🌼Suddenly, somewhere, some day - we find that we are happy. 🌼 I hope today happens to be the day where you find that you are happy. I saw cute dainty flowers blooming nicely today and it made me 😍. Today’s brunch is popiah! 😋It’s always fun to eat popiah- you test your chopstick skills- to hold a piece completely and finish in within 1 mouthful! 😆 And I also supported another stall which sells Hong Kong style pastries. The egg tart is yummy!!! Special mention to these two Snoopy plates. I redeemed these plates using 40 food stickers earned from food spending in Lawsons during my 1 month stay in Tokyo. I think that’s a lot of money! Hehe... and now I have a new idea to do throwback- posts on my daily lifestyle during that memorable 1 month. Stay tune~~~🤓🤓🤓
