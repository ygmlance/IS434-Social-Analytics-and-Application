☆Complimentary Zoom Workshop☆
With every Heart In Hand Atelier Starter Kit purchased, you can redeem a free 2 hr Zoom Workshop: Introduction to Japanese Pastel Art.

Joo Yi purchased a set and redeemed her session last Sunday. It was a lovely 2 hours with her and Davan working on the basic techniques of colour blending and erasing. You know it when someone enjoys herself and that feeling was clearly evident in Joo Yi! I think we can all agree how addictive bubbles erasing can be - it's never enough 🤣

Thank you for a great 2hrs, Joo Yi & Davan!

Heart In Hand Atelier Starter Kit is still available for purchase. Delivery will be made after circuit breaker due to the current restrictions. More product information can be found at the link in my bio profile!
