How to survive without going to salons?⁣
@saeangsingapore Oriental Herb Eoyumi Hair Treatment is my answer!⁣
⁣
After fixing my greys - with @saeangsingapore oriental herb extract hair colour cream no less (see x squares back), I've been diligently using their hair treatment after every shampoo and true to its promise, my hair is now smooth, deeply moisturized and no longer frizzy! Not even after I've just dyed it recently! This is me with washed hair, naturally dried without any blowing 💁🏻‍♀️⁣
⁣
Nothing too elaborate or difficult, all I have to do is to replace my usual hair conditioner with the Saeangmoeri Oriental Herb Eoyumi Hair Treatment. Gentle enough to use everyday, yet moisturisingly rich to seal up all the moisture in your hair cuticles!⁣
⁣
The PATENTED formula contains the 9 types of oriental herb extracts, includin ginseng that prevents hair loss and reduces dandruff, and various other moisturisers that balances the hair. Whether your hair has been damaged due to colouring, hear styling, perming or UV radiation, @saeangsingapore Oriental Herb Eoyumi Hair Treatment will treat and repair it to restore softness of your hair. It is light brown herb colour with a very slight tinge of herb undertone, pleasantly covered by floral top notes so you still smell very nice after every bath. 💐⁣
⁣
The @saeangsingapore premium haircare range also includes shampoo, essence and hair mist, all prized products made from oriental herbs that help to promote hair growth and prevent hair loss.⁣
