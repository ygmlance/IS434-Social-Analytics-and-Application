I am staying at home and... BBQ!

With this eco-friendly biodegradable disposal barbecue pit, now you can BBQ anytime anywhere at home!

No fire starter or charcoal needed! Just prepare your food and start to BBQ! Love how it‚Äôs lightweight and portable! It just takes less than 3 mins to setup, and it‚Äôs able to retain its heat for approx. 60 mins!
