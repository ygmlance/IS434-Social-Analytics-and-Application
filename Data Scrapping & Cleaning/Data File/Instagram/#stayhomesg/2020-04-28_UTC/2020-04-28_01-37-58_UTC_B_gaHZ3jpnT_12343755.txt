I usually stay up late to finish my work, and during this covid period (yes it’s even busier now) I usually sleep between 2-4am. #instagramwife is having HBL and has to wake up early for lessons. But yet, she will try to accompany me by napping in the living room first, or like yesterday, cooks supper to sustain Thru the nite. 🦹🏻‍♀️ Often, our supporters are masked up, incognito, and right beside us! 📸 taken on 1st day of mask collection. #thankGod #stayhomesg #unitedsg #jedining
