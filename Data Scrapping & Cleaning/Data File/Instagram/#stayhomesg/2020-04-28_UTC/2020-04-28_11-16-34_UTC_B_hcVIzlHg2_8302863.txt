Free Flow Ice Cream for Mika🍦😁
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
During this circuit breaker period, Valerie and I are opening our own Cafe! We serve delicious (cardboard) desserts 😆🍦🍰☕️
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Our customer’s (Mika) all time favourite is ice cream!🍦 She spent around 30mins pretending to eat each of the ice cream, putting it back to the stand and took it up again and repeat.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Funny how she could pretend enjoying ice cream, while she actually never has one before 😄🤷‍♀️
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
What should we add in our menu?👩🏻‍🍳💕

PS. One of each items were hand drawn, another were photocopied then sticked onto the cardboard. Could you tell which one is which?😜
