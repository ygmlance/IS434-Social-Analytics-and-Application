In this trying period, is not easy to continue our lives as per normal but we need to make every effort to stay sane for the sake of our loved ones.

I really appreciate my leaders in Preeminent Group continuing to motivate us by conducting this virtual award ceremony, constantly keeping in contact and injecting some much needed positivity into another day at home 
I would first like to say my thanks to my valued clients for their trust and continued support. However during these trying times, I want to especially thank all the front-liners, delivery workers, healthcare heroes and anyone else still out there making our lives as normal as possible. Your sacrifices are greatly appreciated and our thoughts and prayers are with you and you families.
