I remember seeing Spanish Latte on a menu for the first time and it intrigued me. I was wondering what exotic coffee is this, turned out to be coffee with condensed milk. Imagine my disappointment. ⁣
⁣
But this disappointment was soon turned into relief when I was in Korea for exchange and craved for Kopi Peng, and the drink that was the most similar to it was.. Spanish Latte! ⁣
⁣
Making this drink needs no deep explanation, simply add condensed milk with ice, some milk and a shot of espresso. ⁣

I used the @nespresso.sg Master Origin India. This was some sort of comfort because I haven't left the house to takeaway local coffee for a long time 😭😂
