#CircuitBreaker Day22
.

It’s been a long while since we last had fast food thus we decided to pamper ourselves with Burger King Breakfast this morning.. Yayyyy! Ordered a Chick’N Crisp Croissan’wich meal, $5.70 via Foodpanda. The set meal comes with a small pack of hash brown and a hot coffee/tea of your choice. Normmmmm~~ loving that Crispy Chicken Patty sandwich between their breakfast signature soft and fluffy croissant 🥐, melted cheese 🧀 and mayo! Paired with warm and crispy hash brown on the sides and a hot coffee ☕️! Fast food makes our tummy happy and fulfilling! .
