To all the BBT fans, if you are excited to make this, you will need to be mentally prepared because u only get to drink the “homemade bubble milk tea” like 2 hrs later, and the slurping time takes only 5 mins... If you asked me if it’s worth making it, my answer got to be “NO”. It takes too much effort! (I’m also scarred by the amount of starch i had to put for the drink, and imagining that I have been drinking this amount and much more for the past years of ordering BBT.) I promise I will cut down and try to quit! #ipromise #newresolution #homemadebbt #itrymybest #myfirsttime #toomucheffortrequired #stayhomesg
