[Project Neighbourliness]

Yesterday was the last day of our goodie bag distribution. We have finally completed distributing to all our neighbours for the entire block.

Sharing some pictures of our family in action and the kind messages & gestures we get from our neighbours. 
From this little project of ours, we got to know 53 neighbours (their names too!!) and reached out to some elderlies staying alone. We hope to build the kampung spirit and get together once the situation improves. 
In the meantime, we will keep in touch with our neighbours via phone and continue to check on the elderlies when we do our walks at the corridors whilst maintaining social distancing.
