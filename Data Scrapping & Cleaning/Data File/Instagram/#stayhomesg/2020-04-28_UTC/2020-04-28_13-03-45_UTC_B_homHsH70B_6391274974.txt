[WE ARE OPEN]
Hi Good Folks,
.
We’ll still be opened for the Labour Day Holiday on 1st May — and all other public holidays & special occasions until further notice!
.
So, you can still enjoy your TGB favourites, all-day, everyday (well as long as it’s within cafe hours👌🏻)
.
We also have our own ISLANDWIDE delivery now — we highly recommend to place your orders at least 1 day in advance☺️.
.
Pst, we’re still having 20% OFF storewide for self-pickups ya!
.
Take care and stay safe everyone❤️.
