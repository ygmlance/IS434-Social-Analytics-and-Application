Hello! It’s Junior Chef JingleBelle again!
I Really miss this bowl of goodness that mummy used to always make for me. Tried to whip it up myself for the very 1st time. I think using slow cooker would be a better idea though! Anyway, glad it turned out well. Hubby loved it so much! “Wow! Smells so nice!” were his exact words when the soup was still boiling halfway through! 😆😋 #StayHome #StayHomeSG #StayHomewithST
