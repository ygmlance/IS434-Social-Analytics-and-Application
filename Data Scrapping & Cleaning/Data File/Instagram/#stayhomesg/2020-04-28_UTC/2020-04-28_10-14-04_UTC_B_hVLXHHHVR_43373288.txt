Over the next few weeks, we’ll be reintroducing you to some of our previous Shentonistas, as well as friends of Shentonista, who’ll be imparting useful skills or fun activities you can try out to tide through your time at home. Starting from this week onwards, keep a lookout for our new #MadeByShentonistas segment.

We’d love to hear from you too! Is there a certain skill you’d like to share? A topic you’d like to speak about? A dish you think everyone would enjoy? Or someone to recommend for #MadeByShentonistas? We’re always just a DM away.
