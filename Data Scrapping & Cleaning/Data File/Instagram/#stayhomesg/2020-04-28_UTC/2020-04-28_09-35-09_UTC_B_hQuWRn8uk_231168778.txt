Day 22 of #stayhomesg #circuitbreakersg ...
Today I thought I’ll show what comes in the ikea bedroom set:
- “carpet”, felt, quilt, pillow
- chair, table and soft toy(dragon?)
- wardrobe and bed
...
The wardrobe has a rail to hang clothes. I made a hanger out of soft wire.
...
Chicken made a friend! It’s a tiny humanoid! (Pattern from book Teeny-tiny mochimochi) At the moment, this humanoid is genderless and nameless.
...
The hardest part of knitting the tiny humanoid? Pulling the I-cord across the body to make the legs and arms. I may have permanent injuries.
...
Isn’t it great the no of cases in Sg is below 600 today? I’m feeling so hopeful.
