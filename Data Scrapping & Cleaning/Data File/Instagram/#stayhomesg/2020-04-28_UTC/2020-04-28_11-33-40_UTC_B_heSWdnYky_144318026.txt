I will be highlighting a series of hands-on activities that I had done with my kids when they were much younger.
Also, highlighting some instagram accounts that I find inspiring and resourceful.

This was one of my favourite! Using real basketball to learn how to draw a ball and painting it to get the prints. The prints also reveal much about the way ball bounces, the speed and makes beautiful marks of art!
Then I taught kids how to relate back to their comic slamdunk. For more details, go to @growinghearts123 bio.
This is perfect for physical education and art!
Today's inspiration included in my blog post is 
1) @the.homeschoolerpreneur 
A Singaporean mum who now homeschools her son in another place, she diligently prepares and diy all her handmade materials! Now she has even opened her own store @the.homeschoolerpreneur.store 
Pop over to see all her labour of love and enriching activities!
