Circuit breaker Day 22: Biryani for lunch 👍👍👍 Drove down to dabao this (someone recommended). I assure you, it tastes much better than it looks. Huge portions for $8, very value for money compared to the places that sell at $15-$20. 3 portions were too much for 4 pax 😅 Both mutton/chicken options were good; tender & flavourful. Rice was very light & fluffy. Loved all 3 veggie options. Masala tea was on point!
