Day 22 of the Circuit Breaker measures in Singapore. We are not yet at the halfway mark, but we will get there.

Masks, once mainly associated with medical/dental personnel, beauticians, pedicurists, have now become ubiquitous and so essential in our lives.

As the Covid-19 situation evolves, so have masks and their related accessories. Here are some mask straps (or "ear-savers", a cute name used by @theknottyboss) that are meant to relieve the pressure caused by ear straps pulling behind the ears. Crocheted by me, with colourful buttons kindly contributed by @blissfulmm.

If you'd like to know more about the ear-savers, know an essential worker who needs them, or if you wish to contribute by crocheting/knitting them, do check out
