While medical workers are at the forefront fighting the COVID-19 war, our thoughts are with those braving the storm every day to keep food and essentials available and our streets clean, as well as the migrant workers in Singapore who are now cooped up in their dormitories. ‚Å†

At Girlsourced we are looking at ways to do our part and one of the few ways in which we hope to contribute to the fight would be to Make a Mask and Give a Mask. Our stylists have kickstarted this movement by taking out their sewing machines and material to start producing reusable cloth masks. In Indonesia, we have #girlsourcedstylist @putricindana who made use of suitable leftover fabrics from her previous project to make a mask to give to Grab Drivers. In Singapore, @i.am.verna.tan has produced mask covers suitable for both children and adults, and together with Girlsourced is giving out 50 pieces to essential workers. ‚Å†

We hope this encourages you also to support the movement #makeamaskgiveamask  as the littlest efforts create the biggest impact. ‚Å†
