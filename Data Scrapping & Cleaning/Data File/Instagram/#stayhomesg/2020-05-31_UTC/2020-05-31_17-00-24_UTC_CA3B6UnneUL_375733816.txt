My belated Birthday Post! 🥳 My mum & sisters gave me a Huat Kueh as my birthday cake this year as it is the first time that both my Western & Chinese birthdays fall on the same day! 🤔🥮
Thank you all for the goodies, DIY kit, zoom party, booze, love & well wishes!🧁🍺🎁 💌 Despite it is CB, I had one of my most amazing & unforgettable birthdays.🎊
Birthday wish this year is simple & is something I pray for every night. May the Lord watch over us, our families, loved ones & friends. Keep us all safe, happy & healthy! 💪🏻😜 Amen & Huat ah! 🍍🙏🏻🍍
