Missing the kiddos in Cambodia. (Yes, she totally let me win in Duck, Duck, Goose) Sucks that we all can't return back this year, but we are definitely looking forward to next year 💖 Albeit the getting up at 5am and sleeping at 11pm by the time we are done.🤭 They changed my life in so many ways, alot more than us changing theirs. I hope you know you are all not forgotten!! It really makes me reflect and think about how we take our life for granted sometimes. And we should always remember to appreciate  the little things. 🙏🏻 #cambodia  #phnompenh  #donbosco #travel  #circuitbreaker #stayhomesg #sgunited #missiontrip #reflection #payitforward #kindness #bekind #graciousness #thankful #givethanks
