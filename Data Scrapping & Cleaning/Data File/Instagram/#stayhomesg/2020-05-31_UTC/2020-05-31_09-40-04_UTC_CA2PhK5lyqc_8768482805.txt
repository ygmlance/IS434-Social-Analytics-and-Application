Fennel Essential oil:
- Relieves muscle spasms in the gut - Increase movement of cells in small intestines and reduces intensity of colic in infants. - Helps relieve gas, bloating and constipation, but it can also help eliminate diarrhea and it evaporates rapidly, passing off readily in the form of vapor and, therefore, possibly providing relief sooner than later. 
Ginger Essential Oil:
- Ginger essential oil is one of the best natural remedies for colic, indigestion, diarrhea, spasms, stomach aches and even vomiting. - Effective as a nausea remedy as well. - Along with reducing cholesterol levels, ginger oil also appears to improve lipid metabolism, helping decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
