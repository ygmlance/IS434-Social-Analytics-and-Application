【 Day 12 - 💃Mingle Tangle🕺 】
.
.
This is an attempt trying different tools on a new paper type. It looks like a  window with closing curtains. Just like what people always say, "window of opportunity" and thus the following quote to share with everyone.
.
.
“Sometimes we stare so long at a door that is closing that we see too late the one that is open.” -Alexander Graham Bell
