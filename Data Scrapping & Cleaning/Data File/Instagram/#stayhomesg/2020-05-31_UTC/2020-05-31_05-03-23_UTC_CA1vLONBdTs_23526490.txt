My fave bit of #珊瑚海 - #周杰倫 @jaychou & Lara - presented by #TheSunnysideSounds! Yeh, @selwynkoh, @iamcalebtay and I officially have ourselves a name 😂

I still remember the atmosphere on 2/2/20, when this video was taken. It was the weekend after the CNY holidays and a switch seemed to flip. The masks appeared and people were scarce. The 3 of us found ourselves playing to a crowd and in an atmosphere so vastly different from just 2 weeks prior. Nonetheless, we resolved to have as much fun as possible and put smiles on the faces of whoever was there watching. 
Editing these videos feels bittersweet. But with the circuit breaker ending I'm allowing myself cautious optimism that we can be back on stage performing soon. May CNY 2021 be a joyful one! 😍

Thanks to:
