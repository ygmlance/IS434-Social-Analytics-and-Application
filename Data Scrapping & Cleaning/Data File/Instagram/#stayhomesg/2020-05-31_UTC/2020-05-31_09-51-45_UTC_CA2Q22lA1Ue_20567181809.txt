Sweet potato ball ðŸ˜Š

Easy and delicious afternoon snack to accompany our game time.. I added coconut milk to the dough as the sweet potato is too dry after steaming it.

Recipe:
110gr sweet potato
40gr tapioca flour
20gr corn flour 
20gr sugar (flexible)
Coconut milk or water as needed. 
Mixed sugar to the mashed sweet potato follow by tapioca and corn flour. Kneed until a dough is formed. Add coconut milk or water if the dough is too dry.
