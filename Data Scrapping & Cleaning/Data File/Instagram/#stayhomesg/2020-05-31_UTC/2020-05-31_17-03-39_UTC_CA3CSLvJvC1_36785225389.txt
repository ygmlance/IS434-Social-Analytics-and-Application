I needed to do something to boost my motivation! “How can you eat the taugeh you raised?  It’s like eating your plant children!” my daughter commented when I showed my kids that  I was going on with my next project during this circuit breaker period.😅😅😜 Well, the first harvest of my skinny bean sprouts was under 3 days since I started soaking the beans). I overestimated the amount though😂so I passed some of them to my neighbour and there’s still another plate left.  First try: 11 April 2020. #growingbeansprouts #taugeh #beansprouts #hdbgardening #stayhomesg #stayhomesg🇸🇬 #singaporeanyhow
