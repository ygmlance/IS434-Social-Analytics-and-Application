This Korean street egg toast w ham and cheese is so yummy that I had it thrice. Made mango smoothie and yogurt as well.

Slice 15g of cabbage, 10g of carrot, and 10g of green onion finely. Put them in a bowl.
Beat 2 eggs in the same bowl and add a pinch of salt. Whisk it.
Heat up a frying pan with butter over low heat. Pour the egg mixture on the pan to cook.
When the egg omelette is half-cooked, place 2 slices of bread with some gap between them (approx 3cm) on top of the egg omelette.
When the egg omelette is fully cooked, flip it together with the bread to the other side.
Fold the sides of the egg omelette to fit nicely on the bread.
Heat up a slice of ham on one side of the pan.
Move the bread to another side of the pan. Melt some butter in the center and move the bread there.
Sprinkle some sugar evenly on one slice of the bread.
Place the ham on the same slice, on top of the sugar.
Add a slice of cheese on top of the ham.
When the cheese starts to melt, fold the two slices of bread together.
