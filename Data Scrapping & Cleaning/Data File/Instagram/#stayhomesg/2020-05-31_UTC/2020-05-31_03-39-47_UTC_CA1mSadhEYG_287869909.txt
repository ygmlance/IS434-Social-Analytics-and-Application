Salmon Mayo Sandwich || Have a weak spot for all things mayo and thus couldn’t be more happy to spam some @ayambrandsg salmon spread into another sandwich construction ( #notsponsored but I’ve always love their canned tuna esp the wasabi and salmon mayo. Managed to squeeze in two cans this time round 😜). Made with @bakerandcooksg soy and linseed sandwich and @barkersofgeraldine Beetroot relish which really complemented the creaminess of the salmon mayo •
