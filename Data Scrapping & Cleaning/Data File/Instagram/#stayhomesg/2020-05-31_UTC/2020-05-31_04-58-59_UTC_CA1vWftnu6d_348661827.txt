“I just want to squeeze the 💩 out of you” literally speaking when it comes to dough in this household. Just sharing what our kids love making - Moon dough.

1 part corn starch + 1/2 part hair conditioner + food coloring = the most amazing DIY dough. 
This super easy recipe buys me at least 3hrs...if you want a kid free time, do this. My kids are super physical, so this is one way to for them to expend energy....taking it out on the dough ✌️
