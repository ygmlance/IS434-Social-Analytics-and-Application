Traditional Breakfast Set
Me & my husband loves having bread for breakfast and this kaya toast, with 2 soft boiled eggs might be among many Singaporeans' hot favourite list too! 
Bought the kaya from #ahyeessoonkueh, sweet pandan taste match with a slab of salted butter and you just lightly toast the white bread to crusty exterior and remain soft underneath. 
Trying out the tips from @anythingjamie to create soft boiled eggs. It's so perfect! ðŸ¥°
