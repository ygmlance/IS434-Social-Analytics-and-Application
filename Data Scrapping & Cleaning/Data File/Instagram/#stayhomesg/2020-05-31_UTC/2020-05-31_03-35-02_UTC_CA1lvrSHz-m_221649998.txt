I set a target that when CB is over, I want to run to Jurong West to meet my friends, which cannot meet during CB. Even though in the phase 1, I am not able to meet them. But I have achieved my first 10km after so Long of training. .

If you follow me, you will u defat and that I have some lower limb injuries since long ago and I stop my running for years. 2018, I started to do my rehabilitation for the injuries and it told me a long way to reach where I am today. .

Life is not easy. Long distance run is like living your life. There is no smooth path. At point of time, you feel like giving up. Which most did that. And they never able to reach their targeted ending point. Life is not always how fast you can reach you goal. But how you endure to the end and reach you goal. .

I always want to try Gold Coast marathon. Maybe I cannot finish it but if I not going to do it. I will never know. And suppose to go this year. But I think I have to look into next year. And I shall start to have more rehab and training so that I can reach my target. üòÅ
