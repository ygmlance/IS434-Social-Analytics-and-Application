When I was in Japan last year, I spent so much time making drawings and rubbings of woodgrain. Traditional Japanese architecture is rarely painted. The woodgrain is emphasized as the surfaces become bleached by the sun over the years. I found it so beautiful, like I could read time in the surfaces around me.⁠
