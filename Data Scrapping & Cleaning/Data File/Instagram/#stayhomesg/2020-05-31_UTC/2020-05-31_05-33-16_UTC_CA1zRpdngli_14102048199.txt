Are you relieved that Singapore’s COVID-19 circuit breaker ends in just two more days? It seems not that long ago when the measures were announced and parents collectively shuddered at the prospect of #WFHWK. Like any kiasu parent, I looked for fun, educational activities to keep my kids occupied and stumbled upon this card game on @Amazon.sg.

Sushi Go Party! is a fast-paced pick-and-pass card game by @Gamewright for two to eight players. The goal is to score points by collecting an assortment of dishes (categorised into appetisers, rolls, nigiri and desserts). To spice up the game, there are also special cards, such as wasabi and bento sets, with unique score modifiers.

While kids will be delighted by the cute illustrations and fun gameplay, they are what Randy Pausch terms the “head fake”. The real goal for parents is to help their children develop their social, thinking and arithmetic skills. Who knew bite-sized learning could be so fun?
