Jade/Matcha Latte Muah Chee ...
No green tea powder at home, so I mixed 75g of glutinous rice flour with 1 sachet of instant matcha latte, oil and water (125ml). Steam for 10-min  and rolled in whatever grounded peanut I can find in my food pantry, sugar and sesame seeds. Small serving, serve in Chinese tea cup and good for afternoon tea break for 1-2 pax.

A lazy cook, am thinking I could try steaming it in rice cooker while cooking rice, to save time and resources.
