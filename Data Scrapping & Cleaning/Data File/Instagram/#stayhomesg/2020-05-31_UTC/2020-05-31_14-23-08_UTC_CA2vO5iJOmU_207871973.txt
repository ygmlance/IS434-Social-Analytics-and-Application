🍗KFC RICE-COOKER CHICKEN RICE 🍗
Finally tried doing the trending KFC chicken rice recipe and it’s so much simpler than I thought! With only 5 ingredients, you literally throw everything into the rice cooker to do the work for you. I didn’t add ginger cause I couldn’t get my hands on any but I’ll recommend adding 2 slices of fresh ginger into your rice mixture before cooking! Ingredient list below :
—
Ingredients (4 servings)
2 cups of rice
1/4 cup chopped red onions
1/4 cup chopped leeks
2 TBS sesame oil
4 pieces of ORIGINAL KFC Chicken (The reason for original is because the skin is softer with no batter, so it’ll be more suitable for the rice)
& if y’all like chili - TAHO lime chili is the bombs 🔥👍🏻😍
