Even bubble tea isnâ€™t as sweet as her actions!

Angeline, owner of Nineteen Tea, sponsored 330 cups of milk tea to thank migrant workers for their contributions. These were delivered to them alongside meals through YMCA Wok the Talk, which delivers food and grocery packs to vulnerable groups. Thank you Angeline!
