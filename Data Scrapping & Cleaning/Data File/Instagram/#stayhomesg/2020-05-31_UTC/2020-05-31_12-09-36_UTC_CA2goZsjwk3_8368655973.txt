Trying new eats from home! I truly missed curried beetroot from Sri Lanka and was happy to see it featured at Chef Rishi's new restaurant! While nothing beat eating curried beetroot in the lovely campsite at Udawalawe (the first time I had it!), this was a good alternative. The chef's dish didnt disappoint and I'm glad to try this and other sri lankan dishes with my family (as well as to gauge their reaction to this cuisine as reference for future fam trips😁)
