All the flowers of tomorrow are in the seeds of today. ðŸŒ±
The global pandemic has taught us so much about the resilience and gentleness of humanity. We learn to adapt to the new changes and amidst our own struggles, we try to help others along the way with little acts of kindness. 
Life should not go back to normal. If we go back to normal, we would have lost the valuable lessons that this pandemic has taught us. 
May we rise and do better, because we can. ðŸ˜Š
