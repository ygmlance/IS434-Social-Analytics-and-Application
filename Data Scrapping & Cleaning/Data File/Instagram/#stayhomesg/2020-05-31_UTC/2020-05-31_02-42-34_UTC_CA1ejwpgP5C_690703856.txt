We are not perfect and we all have insecurities / weak points. Accept and love yourself for who you are✌🏼
.
Those insecurities can come in different shape and form. It might be my calves but for you it’s your hair or it can be anything✌🏼
.
Yeah I have small calves and not that great genetic for my calves and it used to be one of my insecurities. Over time, I have accepted and love it🙏🏼
.
Such that I am not affected by what others think / say about calves. It’s okay to have insecurities / weak points, embrace them and love yourself for who you are✌🏼
.
Only you know who you really are! Not let someone’s words / opinion dictate your happiness and who you really are. They don’t know you✌🏼
.
Happy Sunday☀️
