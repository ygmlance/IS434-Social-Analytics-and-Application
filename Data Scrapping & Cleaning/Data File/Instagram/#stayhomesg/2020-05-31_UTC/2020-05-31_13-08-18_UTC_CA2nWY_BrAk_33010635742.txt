👩🏻‍🍳 Tried out two new recipes today and made them both concurrently thinking that the quantity is just nice for a week’s consumption. 
Too ambitious 😂, it’s better to focus on one at a time; but totally enjoying the me-time while baking and exploring recipes at my own pace.

The end result didnt turn out the way i envisioned it to be, but 💁🏻‍♂️ said before that f-a-i-l means first attempt in learning. 
It didnt fail entirely, but i’m definitely looking forward to making it better the next time round. 
Thats banana 🍞 & strawberry jam with peanut butter twirl 🍞. #sgunited #stayhomesg #igfooddiary #sgfooddiary #instafood #instabake #singaporehomecooks #breadmaking  #bananabread #peanutbutterjambread #coonutssnoopy#happybellyhappymind
