My dear neighbour supported my balcony gardening project and gave me a new Screw pine cutting. It withered by the time I received her Four o’clock flower (Mirabilis jalapa). This didn’t grow well in my balcony as well. Lost both of them in the end. Depressing. #hdbgardening #hdbbalconygarden #fouroclockflower #stayhomesg #balconygarden #urbangarden
