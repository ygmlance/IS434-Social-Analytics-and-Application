Presenting my one pan { Dak-galbi } aka korean spicy stir fried chicken. Can you tell I’m missing Korea ?! This is also this week’s #cbfoodiesg ‘s theme - chicken and only two of us are taking part ( some unforeseen situation came up for the other 2 kaki 🤣) .
Main ingredients for this dish are chicken , sweet potato , cabbage and rice cake to name some. It is basically a communal dish and it comes serve in a pan with stove on the table so you can cook it yourselves or have the staff cook on the spot for you.
.
You can add rice to it once you are 80 % done. The staff can whip up a fried rice with whatever that’s left in the pan.
.
So yeah here’s my own rendition with kale on the sides for some color :D added cheese as well 🤤🤤😋😋 want some ? Let’s cheers over soju !! 🍶🥂🍷🍾🍻 #sgunited#stayhomesg#
