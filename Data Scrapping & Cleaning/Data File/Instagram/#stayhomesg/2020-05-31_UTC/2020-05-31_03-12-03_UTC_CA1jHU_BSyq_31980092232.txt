In 1971, Simon Nicholson coined the term "loose parts", which are items and materials that are open-ended and can be explored in a variety of ways.

In my classroom, there is a space just for loose parts. I put in twigs, cotton wool, buttons, beads, etc. I love watching the process of them creating using these open-ended items, and the products are always different every time. Some days, the twigs transformed into houses, and on other days, the twigs were pathways for cars (i.e. flat marbles) to drive on.

That is the beauty of loose parts! It gives children the autonomy to create; to be architects, builders, makers, tinkerers in a world full of "Nos" and "You can't do this!" It allows children to be creative, and to take charge in their play experience.

During this quarantine period, children may get tired of playing with the same old toys. Maybe consider jazzing it up with some loose parts? Share in the comments below on how loose parts is benefiting your child or if you have other ideas on playing with loose parts.
