Today's sweltering hot weather is a perfect day for a 'cooling' green bean sweet potato soup! 
SmartyPence Tip 💡
This super affordable dessert is filled with textures & old school memories. Not to mention you can sweet tooth an army at home at a super low cost 😁

Always soak your green beans overnight or a couple of hours before boiling them so that they take less time to soften, saving you time & electricity! I also think using yellow/brown rock sugar also gives it a more aromatic sweetness vs white rock sugar. And this is my sweet ending to the last weekend of circuit breaker 😊 how are you spending yours? .
