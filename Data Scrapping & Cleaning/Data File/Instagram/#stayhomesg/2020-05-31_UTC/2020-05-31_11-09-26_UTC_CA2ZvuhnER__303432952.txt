Looks like the burger binge continues! Some of you may recognise TSO as one of the brands I mentioned in my Burger Week list (affordable hawker prices for restaurant-quality burgers; rings any bells?). Turns out the folks at TSO have finally cosied up in their new Simpang Bedok spot, and are ready to get back on the grill and flippin’ burgers! Here’s a preview of TSO’s BRAND NEW menu!

Yes, charcoal grillin’ and woodfire smokin’ are still the bulwark of TSO’s operations - expect every dish to be permeated with the rustic smokiness and char integral to the brand. To get things going, we decided to mix their classics and new creations: royal mushroom beef for the Dad, the indispensable teriyaki unagi for the bro, and smoky lamb for myself (cause I didn’t manage to try their old lamb burger 😔); chicken skin for the boys as sides, and a set of smoked wings - on the house, much appreciated!! - for my mum to snack on. For those of us who are expecting chips, they’re now replaced with tempura fries. I personally miss their house-sauce drenched chips, but my parents and bro couldn’t be happier with the fries, so there!

Shroom burger: The patty is gorgeous as usual, with the seared crust complementing the tender center, made even better with the light drizzle of blue cheese to even out the heavier profile of the beef. Add on the subtle brine of the shrooms and the sweetness of the onions and bam! Dad finished it in four bites. (He complained I should’ve gotten him another burger smh) 🍔 Lamb w/o tomato: Unlike the other burgers, this came with chunks instead of a whole patty. While usually preferable given my smaller appetite, the height of the buns did end up overwhelming the interior, and my mum felt the chunks were a tad tough. Despite the teething issues, the chimichurri was spot-on, so much so that my mum stole some for her fries! 🍔 Unagi: What else is there to say? Huge slab of unagi sandwiched and airy alfalfa between sweet buns = A very happy bro who inhaled his even quicker than my Dad! .
