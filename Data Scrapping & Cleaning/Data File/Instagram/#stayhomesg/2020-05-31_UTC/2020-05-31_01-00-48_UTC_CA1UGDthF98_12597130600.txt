Chocolate Nut Butter Bars Recipe (Approx 22 bars)

1 cup raw almonds
1 cup raw walnuts
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
1/2 cup  pumpkin seeds
1 cup dl coconut flakes
200 g soft pitted dates
1/2 cup cacao powder
1/2 cup nut butter
1/2 cup maple syrup
3 tbsp brewed coffee
3/4 tsp pink himalaya salt
1/2 tbsp vanilla extract
80 g dark chocolate 70%
2-3 tbsp cacao nibs
flakey sea salt, to decorate

Method:
1.  Set oven to 175â€™C. Spread out the nuts and seeds on a tray and toast for 7 min. Add the coconut flakes and toast for 3 more minutes. Let cool slightly.
2.  Add to a food processor and pulse quickly to a very coarse mixture. Add dates, cacao, nut butter, maple syrup, coffee, vanilla and salt. Pulse a few times until you have a sticky ball.
3.  Line a shallow 21 x 28 cm dish with parchment paper and press the dough into it. Add the cacao nibs on top and press lightly with your hands. Sprinkle with flakey sea salt.
4.  Melt the chocolate over water bath and drizzle over the cake batter. Place in the freezer for 2 hours or more before cutting into bars. The easiest way to cut the bars is to grab a hold of the parchment paper, lift up the entire cake from the dish and place onto a cutting board. First halve the cake lengthewise. Then cut each rectangle into 10-11 pieces. Store leftover bars in the freezer.
