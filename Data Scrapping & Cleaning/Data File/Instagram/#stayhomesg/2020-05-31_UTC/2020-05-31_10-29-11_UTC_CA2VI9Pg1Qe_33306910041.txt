During the #MOESingapore Mid-term break school holiday 2020, our children have imagined themselves in different roles including #firefighters. We respect every #fireman #firewoman (we also watched https://www.ted.com/talks/caroline_paul_to_raise_brave_girls_encourage_adventure/ by the 15th #firewoman in a #SanFrancisco department of 1,500 men) who has risked their lives to save others from the rage of fire. On May 4th, we remembered #InternationalFirefightersDay and made a plan to especially appreciate the firefighters near us #myscdf @myscdf. Though I could not bring my children for her first visit to the iconic #CentralFireStation of Singapore during this school holiday, they enjoyed spotting helicopter and #RedRhino (a light firefighting vehicle) from our HDB windows. #ThankYouFirefighters #ThankYouEngineers #ThankYouFriends (my son's kindergarten friend gave him the #rescuehelicopter as a farewell gift in 2018) | We also have our worries about fire. Our upstairs neighbours littered cigarette butts and lighters, some of them landed on our air-cond latch. They are potential fire hazards. That's why, our son has dreamed for #smokefreeSG.  #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #TobaccoExposed #WorldNoTobaccoDay #DearCovid19SG https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
