May 2020 may now become known as a very trying time of #circuitbreakersg for local businesses.
.
That said, we’re very grateful to all our Good Folks’ support all this while! Be it ordering from us or shoutouts on your Stories or Posts about us — we won’t have survived this CB without you❤️.
.
Even as we officially end CB tomorrow, we know many of us are still unable to roam free🕊... so we’re excited to announce that we will be continuing our islandwide delivery, beyond CB!
.
This means you‘ll still be able to enjoy your TGB favourites in the comfort of your home🥰.
.
Thank you to all who’ve supported us so far, and we hope you’ll continue to do so — we really appreciate every one of our Good Folks❤️.
.
Take care and stay safe & healthy everyone✨✨✨. ~
