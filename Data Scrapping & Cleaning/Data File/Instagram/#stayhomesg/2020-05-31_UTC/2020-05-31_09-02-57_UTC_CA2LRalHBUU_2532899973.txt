Sunday bakes: Coconut cake. I cut down on the sugar as the frosting was white chocolate ganache.  My mistake for this bake was that the oil I used was not coconut ðŸ˜­ It would be perfect if it was. Updated with recipe below:
.
.
1/2 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract 
1/3 cup oil (please use coconut oil!) I had none left ðŸ˜­
1 1/2 tsps baking powder
1 1/4 cups plain flour
1/2 cup coconut milk 
1/3 cup shredded coconut
Some coconut flakes for â€˜embellishmentâ€™
.
.
White chocolate ganache
200g white chocolate 
150g cream 
40g melted unsalted butter 
Whip when cool and ready to frost

I just visited my parents to pass them Eid Kueh and I didnâ€™t cry but it was emotional as my dad tap my head just like  old times. My mask still on and we were talking at the door... I almost cried. I hate so many things now but they made it better. Next week will be sad coz  Rick has to go to work. Felix will be extremely sad for sure. All good things will come to an end but at least Iâ€™ll see Nad and Felix all day.
