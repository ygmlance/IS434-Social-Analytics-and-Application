One of the things that #stayhomesg has done for our family was to let both siblings have more time with each other. Kaylen no longer fusses when Hailey is around him or touches his toys. He even voluntarily talks to her and hugs her. For Hailey, she goes to her kor kor and grabs his hand and pulls his hair affectionately. Love you both dearly❤️ #korkorexcavator #haileyhelicoptor
