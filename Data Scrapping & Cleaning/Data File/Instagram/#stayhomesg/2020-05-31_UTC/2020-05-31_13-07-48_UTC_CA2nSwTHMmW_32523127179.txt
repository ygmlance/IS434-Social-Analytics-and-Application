4. Add the rice and squid ink to the pan and let it coat in the tomato mixture.
5. Pour the wine and fish stock into the pan and let it simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Bring the rice to a boil then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Refrain from stirring in order to form the socarrat. 7. Add additional stock if it's becoming too dry. The texture of the rice should just be al dente.
8. Add the prawns and squid and let it rest for 10 minutes.
9. Top with parsley and lemon wedge for serving.

😋Taste: 9/10. Squid ink offers such a distinct umami to already flavourful paella. Key to a successful paella is to watch over the rice when cooking, be conservative with the fish stock (only add when dry and still uncooked), and listen out for the sound of rice roasting at the bottom of the pan - that’s the socarrat base.
