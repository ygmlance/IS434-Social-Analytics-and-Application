Hokkien mee is a good one to add to your repertoire because it’s incredibly versatile.  Develop a rich, umami stock and you can pretty much do anything you want. If (like me) you wonder: if only this stall has fresher seafood, if only this stall uses thin beehoon, if only this stall provides sliced chilli... try making it at home then you’ll have no one to blame (but yourself). Recipe in highlights.

Phase 1 starts next week! Keep cooking!
