Throwback to when I accompanied Mummy to the letterbox. Mummy said since I've been a good girl she would let me ride my balance bike at the void deck for a while. I rode around for 5 minutes, and when Mummy asked if I wanted a few extra minutes I told her "let's go home!" because the Covid-19 virus is still out there!

Everyone, it's 2 more days to the end of the circuit breaker but even then it is wise to remain cautious and not keep going out if you don't have to. Please, let's all do our part to continue to stay home and stay safe where possible so that we can curb the spread of the virus. Peace out ‚ù§
