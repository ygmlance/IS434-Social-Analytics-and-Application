Sporting tough abs 💪🏻, it's hard to imagine Charles Ng of Lean Bento was once in TAF club, struggling with weight loss. He attributes his physique and youthful looks entirely to eating clean and believes wholeheartedly that you are truly what you eat. 🌟"What I consume shows in my physical and mental self and eating whole foods seems to contribute to an anti-ageing effect on my body, " Charles shares. 🤩⁠
