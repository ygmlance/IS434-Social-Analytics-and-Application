| Bye Circuit Breaker 🍞| Presenting today’s creation; Fluffy Sourdough Coconut Buns with fillings within!
I guess I do have to admit I’ve emerged from this 2 months a #CircuitBaker; rekindling my love for baking beyond biscuits & scones, but moving on to sourdough breads 😊😍
.
I initially thought of it more as a coping mechanism, but subsequently realised how much I actually enjoy the process of creating and labouring out of love, and anticipating the often-surprising end results as there’s only so much I can control. 
There are the rock-hard bakes, and then there are those great ones that simply just... clicked! 🙌🏻 Just like our r/s with daddy God, I’m reminded to do my best (with joy!) and leave the rest in the hands of the Lord - because we know that all things work together for good to those who love Him (Romans 8:28a) 🤗
