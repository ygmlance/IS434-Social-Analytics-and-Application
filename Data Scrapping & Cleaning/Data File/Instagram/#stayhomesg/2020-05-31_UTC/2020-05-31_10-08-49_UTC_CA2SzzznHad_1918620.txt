Today we celebrate Super Axel (M)averick 6th Birthday - and last few days ending of circuit breaker (ehem phase one 🙄).
He chose his own theme, and his own cakes (yes, he wanted 2 cakes and yes, the left cake is toilet roll cake, he wanted it coz he thinks it’s funny). We gave him raw present 🧧for now, and promised that later when the toy shops open we’ll let him run wild and choose his own present(s).. Happiest Birthday for you my boy, may God love & bless you with good health and happiness always. 🙏🏻 .
