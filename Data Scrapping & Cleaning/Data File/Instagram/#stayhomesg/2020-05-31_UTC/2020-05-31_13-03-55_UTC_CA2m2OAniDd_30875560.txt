[ 31 May 2020 // Circuit Breaker Day 55 😳] Shayne and I spent 45mins colouring these two pages from @peopleupsg limited edition book, “Learning Through Covid”. It’s a 50 page educational activity book for kids and it’s very well-written, designed and illustrated! 💯👏🏼👏🏼 Best of all, the book is FREE for all Singapore households 🎉🙌🏼. Shayne and I will be drawing and colouring many more pages from the book in the next few days.. 😄
