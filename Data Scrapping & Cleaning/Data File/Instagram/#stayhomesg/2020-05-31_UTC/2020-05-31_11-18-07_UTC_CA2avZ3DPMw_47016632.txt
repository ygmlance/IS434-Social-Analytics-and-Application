Who knows what will happen in the near future. I just hope people remember that we are not out of the woods yet. And how well we survive depends greatly oh us not being stupid. The world is in a pretty huge mess at the moment and I'm thankful that Singapore is doing way better than most other places. And I hope we keep it that way. End of CB doesn't mean things go back to normal. Because we have a new normal now. And it isn't such a bad thing. So please dont screw this up. Stay safe. Stay sane. Let's do it together.
