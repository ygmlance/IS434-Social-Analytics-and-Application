My neighbour knows I like fern so she gave me the liberty to pull out the wild bird nest ferns from under her Lady palm. Time to replant the paprika seedings as many had  already died. Bought the soil from the supermarket nearby. Phototropismâ€˜s a serious issue for me! #birdnestfern #hdbgardening #balconygarden #hdbbalconygarden #stayhomesg #singaporeanyhow
