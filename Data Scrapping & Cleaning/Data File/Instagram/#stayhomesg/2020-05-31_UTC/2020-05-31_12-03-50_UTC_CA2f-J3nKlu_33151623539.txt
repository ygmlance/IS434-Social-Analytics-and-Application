Besides contributing to a stronger immune system, intermittent fasting (around 36 hours) can also help your skin through detoxification.

1. Only persons in very good health should fast without water. Persons suffering from gall or kidney-stones should never undertake a waterless fast.

2. Sick persons should observe fasting taking plenty of lemon juice (pinch of salt) and water.

3. Persons who are very weak may take a small quantity of fruit and milk.

It’s better to prepare your body for optimum success even before you begin fasting. Start eating light today if you wish to do a intermittent fasting on tomorrow. (tmr is a more effective day for fasting-check out previous post on moon & me & mind)

During fasting the body’s organs get a good rest, and the healing process is more rapid. It is possible for one to get relief even from chronic skin diseases if one goes on a long fast and drinks plenty of water with lemon juice... It was proven that short-term starvation can enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages promoting the process of wound healing and providing protection against some granulomatous infections.
