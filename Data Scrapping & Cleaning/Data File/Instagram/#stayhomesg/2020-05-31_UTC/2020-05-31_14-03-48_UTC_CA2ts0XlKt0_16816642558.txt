#B4IMGONEChallenge

Sunday has always been a great day for Reggae music, so kick back with a rum punch, enjoy the sunshine and enjoy this one! 
Name: @groupe_faygo 
Country: France 
Love me #B4ImGone:  French
Reggae group Faygo, creates music that encapsulate the spirit of travel around the world, creating a sweet blend of Roots Reggae, Dub and Rocksteady with the influence of Fela Kuti's Afrobeats and a touch of the Blues. They have toured many major festivals and set the stage for artists like The Wailers, Mad Professor, Lee Scratch Perry, Black Uhuru and Jimmy Cliff. This four piece band is comprised of lead singer Mister Roots, Cid, Twa'an and See Jay with a discography 3 albums deep including their latest acclaimed release "Together". I first saw this band on the main stage at a festival in Thailand, collaborating with Thai artist @judeankong, and  I was blown away by the musicianship of the band, fronted by a powerful vocalist. That's the beauty of music, when people no matter your culture or creed, colour or country, come together to create a positive vibration.  https://faygo.fr
Masia's Fave #Faygo song: "No More Slavery" ft. Judean Kong. In light of where we are at in the society today, listen to the relevance of these words.
