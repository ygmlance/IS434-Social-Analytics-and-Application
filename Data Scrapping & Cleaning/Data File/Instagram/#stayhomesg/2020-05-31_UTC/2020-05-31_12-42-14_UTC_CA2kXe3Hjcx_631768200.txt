Part 3.
Past on my mini Lotus buns and snack on twi of my favourite dim sum.
Bought from the same stall.
Egg tart and this banana red bean paste fritters. See last pic which I I screenshot from my Instagram 3 years ago. It is called  三味香酥饼。Till thus date I still can't figure out what is the 3rd taste or flavour. 😁
