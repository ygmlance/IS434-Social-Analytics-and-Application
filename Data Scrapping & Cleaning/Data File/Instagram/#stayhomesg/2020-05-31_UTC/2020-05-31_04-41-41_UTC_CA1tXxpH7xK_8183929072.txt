Sometimes it’s only through times like these that we discover hidden treasures beneath the wilderness like this humble store located in the back alley of Sim Lim Square! Who would have thought that a place that is meant for Tech enthusiast holds a eatery that serves really good Thai food!

I tried a combination of their signature dishes and they all didn’t disappoint. From the basil pork with rice, the mince pork omelette (still good even if it’s not eaten on the spot) the creamy ‘lemak’ Tom yum soup and the others like the grilled pork cheek, and spicy pork with lime were all above expectations! These dishes are prepared by a Thai cook and along with their partner, the flavors are tweak slightly towards the Singaporen palette which explains why I did not have anything bad to say!

Do give them a chance and try out their food via delivery or pick up and I promise you that you will be speaking Thai in no time.. sawadeekap🙏🏽
