During the #MOESingapore Mid-term break school holiday 2020, our P1 son learned the #firefightersPrayer and wrote it to thank every #firefighter #fireman #firewoman who has risked their lives to save others from the rage of fire. I first learned about the prayer when I was visiting Boston a decade ago. #时间飞逝! On May 4th, we remembered #InternationalFirefightersDay and made a plan to especially appreciate the firefighters near us #myscdf @myscdf. Though I could not bring my children for her first visit to the iconic #CentralFireStation of Singapore during this school holiday, they enjoyed spotting #RedRhino (a light firefighting vehicle) from our HDB windows. #ThankYouFirefighters #ThankYouEngineers (https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/red-rhino-inspired-batmobile) | We also have our worries. Our upstairs neighbours littered cigarette butts and lighters, some of them landed on our air-cond latch. They are potential fire hazards. That's why, our son has dreamed for #smokefreeSG. #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #TobaccoExposed #WorldNoTobaccoDay #DearCovid19SG https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
