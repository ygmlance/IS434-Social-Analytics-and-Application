Hi guys!! Welcome to @kklay.co . My aim for this account is to create a space where people genuinely enjoy what I make and are able to keep a little piece of it for themselves. I want to explore my artistic abilities and creativity, & I hope you love my creations as much as I do. üñ§‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£

This first collection was inspired By The Sea (haha). I've been debating between releasing this or another collection, but I chose this because it reminds me of a better time before covid-19, when we could still go out any time and any where. I miss going to the beach and picking up seashells‚Ä¶ incidentally, all the seashells used in this collection are REAL and handpicked by me! They've all been washed and sanitised multiple times, don't worry :) ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
