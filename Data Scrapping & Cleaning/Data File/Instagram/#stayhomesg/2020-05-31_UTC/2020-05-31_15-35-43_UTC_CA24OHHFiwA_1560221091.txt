I grew to realize that I process emotions mostly through my brain rather than my heart. I'm a thinker. Most times because I 'feel' through my head, I'm able to change how I feel through my thoughts and ideas.

That's how I hid my sensitivity. I convince myself to be unemotional. At times I act like I don't care, other times I'm not participative and sometimes even talk in a nonchalant manner. Hiding my sensitivity isn't hard in everyday life since nonchalance is not just acceptable, it seems to be the ideal for some.

I'm now conscious of the Ling Jun who relies on his thoughts but it's something I've relied on and grown up with, and it is going to take awhile to change. It's not wrong to rely on our brains to process every thought and emotion. However, it certainly doesn't help for actors to be thinkers when processing emotions on screen. It just seems off, rigid and unnatural.

Nowadays I cherish every moment that I'm in touch with my emotions. One day it'll feel right.
