Second attempt resulted in a creamier kaya layer and nicer rice. Well done me. 🙆🏻‍♀️ What, to you, constitutes a good kueh salat? 
Also spent half the day working on the lor mee, ngoh hiong & lor bak.

Also spent the entire day hyping my son & myself up for school tomorrow only to remember school starts on Tuesday when I put him to bed.

Also realised, tomorrow is 1st June. 🍻 .
