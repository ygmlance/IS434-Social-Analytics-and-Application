Today, we begin a new series of daily devotions on Revelation 1-7 for the month of June. May you delight in the Word of God as you meditate day and night and become an evergreen tree growing and bearing fruits.

READ
"1 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, 2 who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. 3 Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it, for the time is near." ASK
Who is revealing what to whom in Revelation?
What benefit is there for those who receive this revelation?
When will the message of the revelation be fulfilled?

PONDER
Revelation warns us to be careful as we read this Bible book (see Rev. 22:18-19). In what ways are readers of Revelation often careless?

PRAY
Thank God that he has allowed you to hear the testimony of Jesus, just as the angel gave it to John.
