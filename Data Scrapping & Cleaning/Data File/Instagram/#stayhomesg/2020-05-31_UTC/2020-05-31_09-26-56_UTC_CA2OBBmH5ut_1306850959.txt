🌿Suddenly the heart lifts with joy- finding itself part of all that is. Sunlight and cloud, trees, rivers, wild geese flying. A moment’s glory. 🌿 Sunday is always joyful because I can sleep late on Saturday and wake up late on Sunday. 🤣🤣🤣 Next week is a special week and today I went to Northpoint to run some special errands, order special stuff, bought flowers and subway lunch again! This bouquet is so cute and they resembles tiny sunflowers! 🌻🌻🌻 Anyway, no foodart today because it’s almost 2.15pm by the time I reached home. Too hungry to draw anything! However, I’m working on something really cute now for something special tonight and will post it when I’m done! Stay tune! 🤪🤪🤪
