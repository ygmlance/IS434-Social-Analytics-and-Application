Breaking Circuit D37...
MAKAN...Today is self-declared health day. Surya Namaskaar & black-and-blue weights, here I come. Lunch. Slow cooked veggie broth it is. With herbs from my balcony garden. Store-bought fresh & fragrant Italian parsley, home-rooted and balcony planted. Ignites my diuresis. My throne, here I come. Shoo away those kidney stones!
