This CB.. Im really very blessed.. Other than work I hope everybody can take some time to appreciate this special 2 mths with the people ure living with

Fulfilled my dream to stick to my husband 24/7 while being able to work from home.. though there's bickers n small argument but we had moments like bedtime chitchat, act like idiot to make each other laugh, cook for each other... things that maybe along e 12 yrs relationship we might hv taken granted for 
Endless attention, care and concern from my Mom. Even a small "ah!" She will came running to me as though I had a fall.. and also constant nagging about how I'm putting on weight. 30 yrs old but I'm forever 3 in her eyes. She also constantly seeks for my attention

Dad behaving like a kid, sharing with me his thoughts and obstructing me from work HAHAHAHA.. he always tried to be part of my life when he should know that he is part of my life

Although things may have taken a halt these 2 mths but LOVE can bring u far and gives u more energy to move forward ‚ù§ 
Tell them how much you love them today
