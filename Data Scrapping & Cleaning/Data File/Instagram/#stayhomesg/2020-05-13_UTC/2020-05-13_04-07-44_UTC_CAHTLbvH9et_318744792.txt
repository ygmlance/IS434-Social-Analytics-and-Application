I love protein / grain bowls and saw this protein bowls @bengwhocooks featured on CNA. They were doing nice stuff such as giving away free bowls to people who need it. So I decided to try this grain bowl and support them abit (I paid for my lunch and delivery lol). Ordered the fish and chicken bowls which came with rice and random sides such as onsen egg, vege, mushrooms, potato, cherry tomatoes. Yummy with generous portions! Hahaha can support em but don't take advantage if you can afford to pay for your own lunch!
