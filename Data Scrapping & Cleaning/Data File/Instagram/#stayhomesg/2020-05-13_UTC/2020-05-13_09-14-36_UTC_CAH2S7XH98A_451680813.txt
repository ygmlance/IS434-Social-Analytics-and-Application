Congratulations to our Little EcoHero Poster Contest winner, Noah! With a little input from Growing with the Tans, this special Little EcoHero Sunbeams Surprise Pack was curated for a 7-going-8 year old who loves insects, animals, and saving the Earth.

And a huge thank you to all the participants who took part in the Little EcoHero Poster Contest. Let's continue to flex our superhero powers and save the Earth every day with  tips from the Little EcoHero Pledge (tinyurl.com/WitBLittleEcoHeroPledge). #littleecohero #earthday #earthday2020 #climatechange #plasticpollution #earthdayeveryday #planetearth #stayhome #stayhomesg #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #sgcircuitbreaker #SGUnited #SGStrong #sunbeamssurprise
