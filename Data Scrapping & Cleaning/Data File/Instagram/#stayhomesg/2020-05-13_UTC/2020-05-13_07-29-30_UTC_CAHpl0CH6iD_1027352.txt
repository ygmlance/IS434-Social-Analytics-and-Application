Believe it or not, this was the first time I had @kamsroast_sg’s food. So thank you, Jo and @brandcellar for making it happen. To top it off, my family and I got to pair the food with authentic Hong Kong-style Milk Teas by @kamkeecafe, made possible by Kam’s Roast X @joy_luck_teahouse collaboration to launch the brand in Singapore. The “Pearl of The Orient”, a #milktea with brown sugar pearls, and the other milk tea with premium marine collagen were indisputably fragrant but I found them a tad sweet and gave my feedback to Jo when she asked.
I know many people enjoy the “Roasted Duck” from #KamsRoast but I was more taken by their “Soy Chicken” and “Lap Cheong” (Preserved Sausages).
The former was very succulent and moist, and tasty right down to the bone. I even ate the skin, something I never do unless the chicken is fried, because the jelly-like texture of the “Soy Chicken” was appealingly springy.
As for the latter, there were two types, a Pork and a Goose Liver. Both were superb. I could have them alone with steaming hot rice and some blanched greens.
The portion of “Siew Yoke” (Roasted Pork Belly) I received that day was on the lean side. Not sure if it’s the restaurant‘s usual style but it’s ideal for those who want to indulge but fear the sin.
Sweeter than average in my opinion, the “Char Siew” came cut in chunks for a bigger chew.
For the accompanying carbs, we had egg noodles tossed in a light sauce as well as plain rice. I’m glad a serving of “Poached Hong Kong Kai Lan” was also included.
The “Marinated Cucumber in Vinegar and Garlic” was a piquant, crunchy little number that went down very well with us too. 
When you order now from the link in their bio, you get to enjoy 20% off certain dishes. @kamsroast_sg provides islandwide delivery priced between $5 and $8.
