👋🏼 Hi everyone, please meet Hatchery Cribs’ delivery heroes - Kinsley and Aloysius! Come rain or shine, and even during the circuit breaker restrictions, they have been hard at work ensuring that all of you get your items delivered on time!
. 
Meet Kinsley, he is a father of 2 young boys, he loves spending time with his family, and can’t wait to bring his kids out to play once the circuit breaker restrictions are over.
.
Meet Aloysius, he loves the #stayhomesg movement as he can now eat, sleep, and watch dramas everyday. He loves duck noodles, so those with recommendations please hit him up 🍝
.
Delivering & installing furniture isn’t easy, our furniture weigh up to 50-60kg, and some come in very bulky boxes, imagine carrying that up the stairs! The next time you see them, do say hi! 😊 Small gestures like simply switching on the fan for them while they assemble your furniture makes a huge difference (Singapore’s weather is no joke, and especially with a mask on, it certainly is not easy). A little kindness goes a long way, and we appreciate it from the bottom of our hearts ♥️ #thankyoudeliveryheroes
