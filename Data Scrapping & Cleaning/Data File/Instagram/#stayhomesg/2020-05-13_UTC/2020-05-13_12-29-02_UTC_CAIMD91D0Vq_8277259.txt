Edit: forgot to add “1 tbsp cinnamon powder” under ingredients!

Who would have thought kids would love the taste of cinnamon! 
I combined two recipes for this to adapt it to the airfryer method. Probably think this is the easiest air frying bake I’ve tried so far! Not sure if the Swedes will give it a thumbs up nor does it look very proper but it still tastes pretty good I’ll say 😂. ⁣⁣
