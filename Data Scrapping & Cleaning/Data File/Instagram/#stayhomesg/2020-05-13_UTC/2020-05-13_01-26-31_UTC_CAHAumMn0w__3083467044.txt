#circuitbreakerday37 / 28(+28) 🗓  Mineral makeup💄 provides flawless coverage while allowing your skin to breathe. 
Fewer ingredients often means the makeup's better for your skin. Exfoliate regularly. 
Once or twice a week works for most. If you have oily or combination skin, use a chemical exfoliator like glycolic or salicylic acid. Those with normal or sensitive skin will reap the greatest benefit with a microdermabrasion formula exfoliator -- the kind with little beads that scrub your face. 
If you have missed our FB 'Live' tutorial on the proper way to cleanse your face🧖‍♀️, catch us LIVE tonight on The Ultimate Circuit Breaker Self Care Guide at 9pm! 🕘 https://www.facebook.com/Pitanguisingapore/
