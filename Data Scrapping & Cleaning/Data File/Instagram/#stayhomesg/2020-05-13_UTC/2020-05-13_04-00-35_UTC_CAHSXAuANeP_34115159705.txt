If you are into the traditional Singapore-style tze-char or if youâ€™re bringing your parents to try out plant-based dishes, Whole Earth is the place to go! They use the freshest ingredients, prepare them with care to deliver consistent and awesome quality food to their customers. .
.
A must-order from Whole Earth would be their traditional Teochew-style Olive Rice. Itâ€™s on almost every table and definitely hits your palate with all the right earthy notes. Everyoneâ€™s gonna love that dish! Another dish that weâ€™d recommend is the Handmade Yam Treasure Yam Ring. The middle of the yam ring is filled with hearty ingredients like lily bulbs, capsicum, celery and more! So hearty, and so good!
