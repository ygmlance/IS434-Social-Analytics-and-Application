D-20 - Almost through with our circuit breaker! * fingers crossed* Hows everyone cooping with it? Strange enough for me, counting down to the end of it seemed far away, but looking back at how far we've come actually seems pretty fast.

I was stuck in a tough phase and there were days where these chaos and uncertainties truly got me going nowhere but I constantly reminded myself that if you are blessed with your health in these times, then embrace the feelings that you are faced with. Learning to deal with our emotions can be real challenging but we have to constantly find the sliver lining in every dark cloud to endure.

Also taking this as a time where you can just idle and chill instead of letting the internet pressure you to hustle. There's no need for any competitions as we are not fighting each other, the only enemy here is the virus! Nobody knows when life will go back to normal so lets just keep doing the good we do, spread love and positive energy for a better tomorrow!
