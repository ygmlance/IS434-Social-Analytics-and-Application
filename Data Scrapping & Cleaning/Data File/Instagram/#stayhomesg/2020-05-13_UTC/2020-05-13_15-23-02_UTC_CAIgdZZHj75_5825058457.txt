The last thing to do before going to bed is to drink his milk. I'm happy that he accepted Autumnz PPSU bottle. He loves the cute prints on the bottle. ⁣⁣

The bottle is light, highly durable and long lasting. The bottle is easy to hold. He used to ask him to hold for him but now I don't have to hold for him anymore. ⁣⁣

The anti-colic teat with air valve system reduces colic and enables smooth feeding experience making it an excellent choice for alternating between breastfeeding and bottle feeding. ⁣⁣

If you are looking for a light, highly durable, with high level of daily usage, easy to assemble and clean and BPA-Free bottle, this is the one!!⁣⁣
