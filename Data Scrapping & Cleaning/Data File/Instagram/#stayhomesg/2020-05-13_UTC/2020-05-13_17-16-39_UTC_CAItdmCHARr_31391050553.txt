It’s 1.12am and I just ended my day.. just feel like I wanna share a little part of my day and thoughts. I know many of you will be 💤 asleep by now.. but yup!

I had the biggest Blondie order today 😋 I know I say this a lot but I’m really very grateful for everyone’s support and orders 😌 hehe.

I also.. realise how hard it is being a delivery person 🚚.. and the lil gestures really brightens up their day, I received a few packets of drinks from my friends today and i was already touched by their actions😍🥺imagine getting them from a complete stranger.. 🤩 would totally make their day! I appreciate and feel so much more for people who do deliveries now.

To all the people out there doing any sort of deliveries.. y’all are really awesome 😎👏
