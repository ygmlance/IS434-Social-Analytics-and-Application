Last Sunday’s dinner was from @metasingapore as I had enjoyed my last meal from there very much (thanks again @kieranngsweepoh) and was keen to explore more of their Takeaway Menu.
The Meta Family Meal #Gimbap ($15) was the one item I repeated because when I ate it the previous week, I found it to be one of the best versions to have ever passed between my lips. The ratio of seasoned rice, tuna, egg and vegetables was precise and the resulting rice roll was so delicious, you will be enticed to pop them non-stop.
Also from the a la carte section of the menu was the #Pajeon or Seafood Pancake ($30 for 2 pax). It possessed a fluffiness and delicate sweetness from onions which sets it apart somewhat from the ones at classic Korean restaurants. 
Chefs @ashleyso1 and @soonkiatt did the Staff Takeover Menu ($38) for that single day and it‘d caught my eye because the main dish was Assam Laksa. For some reason, I felt an overwhelming hunger for it and promptly took action to secure a Set Meal. The chefs did an excellent job with their refined take on the laksa - I adored the aromatic, tangy gravy thickened with shredded fish. However, the standout for me was the Grandmother’s #NgohHiang. Comprising of coarsely minced Iberico Pork and Botan Ebi (thanks Chef @kevinwongxx for the info), it had a shatteringly crispy fried beancurd skin wrapping and was seasoned on point. The Achar and Pengat Pisang dessert that completed this Set Menu, were good too.
The week’s Korean Heritage Menu ($45) was another item I’d had my eye on since Meta shared it on Instagram. Mainly because of the big bowl of Bibimbap which I ended up ravishing after mixing in some of the Korean chilli sauce provided. As for the Seaweed Soup, Meta’s signature Chawanmushi, Stirfried Kimchi and dessert of Cream Caramel - they were executed flawlessly as expected.
