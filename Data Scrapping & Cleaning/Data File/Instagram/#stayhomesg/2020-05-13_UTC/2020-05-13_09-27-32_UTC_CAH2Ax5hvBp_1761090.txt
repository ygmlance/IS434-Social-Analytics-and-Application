It‚Äôs #MACFixPlus #Hack time! I have #Eczema which makes my facial skin extra sensitive. I like to do this #PrepandPrime routine right before making an appearance! Grab yours at our MAC store on @lazada_sg, free delivery for $70 & above (click link in bio)‚Å£
‚Å£
1) adding #MACLightfulC #SofteningLotion helps to plump up and mildly exfoliates the skin surface while brightens discolouration‚Å£
‚Å£
2) adding #MACFixPlus Rose helps to soothe my sensitive skin with ingredients like #Glycerin, #Chamomile & #Cucumber ü•í extract‚Å£
‚Å£
3) add #ChilledWater for a burst of H20, plus chilled water works great for the heat spots that occur on my face from time to time‚Å£
