Even though we are not able to meet as a church, we can still serve as a church. Thank God for the opportunities He has provided. @breadtalksg bread is delivered together with the daily lunches and dinners that we provide to our communities in Bishan. Let's seek to be a blessing and do good to our nation, neighbors and communities.
