Day 37 of circuit breaker, Leodys relax day even though it is not Sunday. As I am having exam today, I took the while day to do revision so do not have spare time to teach Leodys. He woke up from his 3hours nap showing me this happy face. I am still co sleeping with him, do understand the bad parts but I also canâ€™t bare myself to love the precious bonding with him on bed. I really love how he will come grab my face and kiss and hug me before he goes to sleep. He also will wake up, climb up and kiss us. It is tiring of not having an uninterrupted sleep every day, but these bonding will never come back. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #relaxday #happyday #3hrnap #solidnap #wakeuphappy #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #jywedz
