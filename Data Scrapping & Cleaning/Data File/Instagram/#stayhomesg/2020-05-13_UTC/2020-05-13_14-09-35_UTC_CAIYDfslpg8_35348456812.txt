I ran out of acrylic paints so I have been using color pencils for the past few days. 
I drew myself with red boots. I think it is very cool and bold. 🤣

Alone is too lonely so I drew my bf also. 🌸🌺🌷🌹 It has been more than a month since I last met my friend. Luckily I am stay home with my parents and sister. I can’t imagine how you feel when you do homestay alone without anyone else and you can online meet via “internet”. I tried to imagine your feeling, the isolation, the looniness... Hopeful this pandemic will be over soon and all frontier workers can have a good break and bonding with their love ones.
