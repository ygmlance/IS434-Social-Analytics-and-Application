“Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key.” ~  @madonna 🔑 ♥️

On this day 4 years ago, I was given the keys to #CHERYLBUYSAHOUSE!! Aaaah the sweet satisfaction of home ownership, or in Singapore, home LOANership. 🤣🤣🤣 (thanks 99-year lease) I got this place as a happily single 41 year-old and met my forever boyfriend by Christmas the very next year. 🥰 Today, this is a home my husband Matthew & I build together. One that is full of love, ♥️ good food, 🍽 a full bar, 🍷 never ending laughter, 😆 & an abundance of hugs for anyone who walks in 🤗. It is a sanctuary that makes this #circuitbreaker period more than just bearable, but a total joy to spend time in, work from, be creative in & unwind from the day in. ♥️ I love our home! 🥰 What do you love about your abode? 🏡 .
