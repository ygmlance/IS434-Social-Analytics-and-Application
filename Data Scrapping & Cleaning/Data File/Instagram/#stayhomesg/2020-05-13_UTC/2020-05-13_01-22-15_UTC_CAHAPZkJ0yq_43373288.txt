Our #MadeByShentonistas series continues with a fun dance tutorial to lighten your mood, taught by @alyssakht, who’s also a dance instructor at @legacy.dco. Explore a fun way to work up a sweat, while learning some smooth dance moves that will come in handy for your next virtual meet-up or the long-awaited post-CB party. 
Try the routine for yourself, and tag @Shentonista in your post/stories so we can share it too!  #Shentonista #theuniformsg
