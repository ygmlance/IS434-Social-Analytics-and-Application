As I exercised in the morning outside my corridor, it started to pour heavily. The splatters of the cold rain tingled up a warmth of gratefulness unto the Lord for our house. A shelter from the cold and reckless weather. I recalled an incident when I got caught by a storm sitting behind the open lorry. The hard pellets of raindrops were like bullets shooting down mercilessly on my body. It was the worst journey i had for a long time. I never knew how painful it was till then, due to the speed of the lorry and the heavy rain. 
I thanked God for a house and a home in Him. It reminded me of Ps91:1-2. Then as I opened my devotional book for today, Ps91: 4 was the key verse. With that, I wrote out the whole psalm so that I can view on my study board and meditate on His precepts.
Giving thanks for a safe haven and heaven!
