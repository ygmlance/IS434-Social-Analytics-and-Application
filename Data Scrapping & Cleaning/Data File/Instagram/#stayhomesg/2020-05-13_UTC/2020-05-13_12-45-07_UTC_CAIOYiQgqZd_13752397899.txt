When my oldest was born, I received my first set of Christian board books from an aunt. I did not realise it until we got them, that we did not have any others, and I was touched by the gifts. Having the books around to read and bond with my little baby has made many precious memories, and I knew that I was doing something that mattered in eternity.
Today she's 6 years old, and we get to have deeper conversations about how amazing God is (God who made the sun, moon and stars also made her and cares about her!), and what a great delight that she is building up her faith in a personal way as she knows God and His love more.
