#blooms ! These beauties never fail to lift up my mood when they appear weekly at my doorstep. Thanks to @dotinthecity for introducing weekly flower subscriptions to this suaku auntie ü§£ They have been a weekly soothing balm to my heart. 
The past 2 weeks have been particularly overwhelming and draining on all fronts and I am running on empty. Big hugs and thanks to friends who have msgd me to find out how I am holding up and for keeping me and family in your well wishes. You know who you are ‚ù§

Here's hoping to a good upcoming weekend and a better week.
