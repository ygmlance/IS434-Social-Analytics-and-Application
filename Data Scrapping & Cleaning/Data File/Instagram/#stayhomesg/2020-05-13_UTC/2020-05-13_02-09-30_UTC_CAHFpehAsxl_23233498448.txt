Not low carb. Yesterday's naughty dinner! Tried Shake shack for the first time, it was alright. Didn't think it was anything to really shout about. Glad I've got my ketones to mitigate the carb crash. I also think I'd be gaining weight this stay home period if not for the drink! Haha.

Btw, sometimes I'll just take out the buns if I wanted to keep it low carb while having fast food (maybe order a double layer of beef too) and of course, not order the fries! ðŸ˜‚
