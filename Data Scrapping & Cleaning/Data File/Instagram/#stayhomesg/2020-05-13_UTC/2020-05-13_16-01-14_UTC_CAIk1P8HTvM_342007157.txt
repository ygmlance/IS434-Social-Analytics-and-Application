Over the weekend, we had some extra coca-cola (ordered pizza not knowing it came with a bottle of Coke), so we did an experiment: cleaning coins. It was a battle between coke, soapy water and ketchup. While Sean was digging up all kinds of rusty-looking coins (no idea where he found so many), Aidan decided to draw his hypothesis - comic-style of course. I think it was quite a failed experiment coz we couldn't decide on the winner. But well, I now have a bunch of shiny coins!
