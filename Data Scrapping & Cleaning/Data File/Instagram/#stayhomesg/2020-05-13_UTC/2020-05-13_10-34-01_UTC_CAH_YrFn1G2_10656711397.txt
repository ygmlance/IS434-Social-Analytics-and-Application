疫情見溫情 ❤️

The 300 bottles of Graviteabar refreshments are on the way to St Luke's Hospital! (How thoughtful of them to put in bottles instead of usual cups)

Kudos to Graviteabar - They actually did all the preparations and processed them till early morning, even attaching a lovely card and having them delivered personally to the hospital. 💕 
Despite the Covid period, they did not care about profiting - in fact, they have absorbed more than half the costs themselves in spreading the love together. Graviteabar, you have earned my utmost respect!

There's not a reason not to smile! Thank you to the Graviteabar team and St Luke's Hospital!

Of course, to all the lovely volunteers who chipped in for this round - You guys have made a difference and brought smiles to our healthcare heroes! 
Thank you for making Project BBT a success!
