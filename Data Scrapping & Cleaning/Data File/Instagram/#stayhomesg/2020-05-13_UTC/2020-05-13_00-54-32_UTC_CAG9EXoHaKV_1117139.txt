Be(at) Calm// A S A L A T O
It’s not with intention that I laid out plans to pick up a new instrument. I definitely wasn’t seeking but because I wasn’t seeking I was open for what’s to come- and indeed what came was a combination of endless learning and laughter.

I’m kind of at the completion of my 4th lesson. Every Monday without fail new tricks were taught against the backdrop of Jay Chou’s repertoire of songs. It didn’t matter how fast or  retarded my hands were- what mattered was that we try. Sometimes I wonder how amazing Madeline’s (@asalatosg )ears were to be able to spot the mis-beats over ZOOM. And I’m enjoying every groove and rhythm, including those I missed! It’s oddly therapeutic.

The Asalato may seem like a 龙卷风 at first but it’s ‘tame-able’. I profess this with humility, because there’s no one to catch up to, no one to impress but yourself, the beat will always be there for you. You just have to show up and shake and one day the sweetness of  麦芽糖 will be there. I’m looking forward to my next class!
