🍞 🥑 🍅

Avocado on whole grain bread has become one of my favourite breakfast. It's simple, easy to make, and most importantly, healthy!😆

Today's avo toast features poached egg with sliced tomatoes at the base. I prepared my semi-ripe avo by mashing it lightly and adding in a drizzle of olive oil and squeezed lemon. Lastly, topping off with chia seeds🤤
