It’s been a while. Most of us have by now gotten so used to the out-of-bed look literally, we don’t need to recreate really. 
The reality of this CB is as a friend shared, all her BBs are drying up. So I decided to put some of my regular makeup to the test to see if they too have dried out. 
Making up for lost times. Here’s my shoddy attempt to go for the au natural look for a zoom meeting later. 
I think my makeup skills may have been a little rusty but what I do remember is @venetia’s quick smoky eye tip: after drawing your eyeliner, just blink (or in my case, close my eyes and press tissue down to blot) and voila! You get a reverse lash effect or soft smudge below the eyes. Then blend it out to finish.
