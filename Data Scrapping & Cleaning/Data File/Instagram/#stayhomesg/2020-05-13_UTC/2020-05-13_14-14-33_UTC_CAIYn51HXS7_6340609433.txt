Coconut rice is very fragrant and fluffy, with nice aroma and not too oily. Homemade Otak is very fragrant and has a hint of lemongrass taste to it, very authentic and delicious! Ikan bilis is super duper crispy and peanut is crunchy. Their Sambal is da bomb, it’s not too spicy and adds more flavours to the whole plate of coconut rice! Although this plate of Nasi Lemak is not cheap, it’s definitely worth it’s  price with genuine and good quality ingredients. We truly enjoy this sumptuous plate of Nasi Lemak in our comfort 🏠! ⠀
