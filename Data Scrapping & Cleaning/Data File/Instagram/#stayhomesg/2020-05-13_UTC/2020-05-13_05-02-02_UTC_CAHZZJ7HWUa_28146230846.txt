Feeling so loved by my favourite #CJOrg and @charles.juay 
Thank you for bringing Japan to us even though we had to miss out on our QCE trip this year. The food is so atas somemore! Truffle Kurobuta Don!! My whole house smells like truffles now ðŸ˜†

I almost thought that my sis ordered it and gave it to her by accident
