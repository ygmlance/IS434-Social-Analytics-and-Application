Stir Fried Udon cooked in KL Hokkien Mee style. Simply love the dark sauce noodle complemented with a tinge of spice. Yummy !! Loving these plates I got off Amazon and shipped from the U.S haha I never imagined buying plates from the U.S but yeah that's what lockdown did to me... #sgEats #StayHomeSg #SGUnited #sgHomeChef #SGHomeCooking #sgFoodies #Covid19HomeCooking #SGHalalEats #Iftagram #Ramadan2020 #StayHomeForSG #StayHomeWithAscott
