First time order food delivery and it failed on us. Order supposed to come from 11am to 12pm.

Ended up getting cancellation by restaurant at 1215pm ğŸ˜‘

Hurriedly whip up a simple fried bee hoon and air fried nuggets for my boy and myself in 20 mins. Huge relief as my boy  can get quite fussy when he's hungry. 
Guess we are better off sticking with home cooked food or buying take out in person ğŸ˜‚
