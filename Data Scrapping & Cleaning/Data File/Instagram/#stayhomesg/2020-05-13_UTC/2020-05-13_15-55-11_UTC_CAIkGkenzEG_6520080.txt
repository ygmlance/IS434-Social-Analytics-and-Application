Ma man! @azfarhashim.jpg What a noble thing to do :) We shall sing for charity too! My wife @wonderwomanmei , coco (our restless pupper) and I would like to dedicate this rendition of Gary Barlow's Forever Love to our family, all health care heroes and migrant workers. 
Let us unite and help raise $50K for FoodBank Singapore. You can head on to our campaign on Giving.sg to donate.

Thank you so much everyone :) Sing for Singapore
