This lil chickadee🐥 loves to bake with me.. so she eagerly came into the kitchen, grabbed her stool, and insisted to “help mummy” when I was making a Vanilla Custard Cake.

She was so diligent and earnest about it, I just couldn’t resist documenting it!

She asked me what every ingredient was, what she was doing, and kept trying to eat the batter “mmmm! Custard is.... so yummy!”🤣

Never mind that we overcooked it (I took the kids out for a jog and left it in the oven for 5-10 mins too long oops).. all three kids LOVED it and had 2 slices each.

...with Chloe happily announcing to everyone that she made it 😋
