Addictive crispy chicken bites!! 😍😍😍
This recipe will only work if y’all use breadcrumbs - When you coat the chicken in breadcrumbs, it gives a crispy exterior and when done right, the chicken is still juicy on the inside! Give it a shot if you guys are craving for fried chicken~ PS : If you decide to fry the whole thigh/chicken breast, it’ll turn out like a chicken katsu! 😋 #ShersVideoRecipes
