Circuit Breaker team lunch via Zoom made memoorable when the meal was cooked and personally delivered by the boss, who zipped around the island to 8 other teammates.

Never mind that lunch came in a sturdy reusable container that could be microwaved to heat the food, or that there were eco-friendly utensils and a colourful serviette included. 
Also never mind that lunch was delicious aglio olio with prawns and a fat scallop, all specked with chopped parsley, and included a small container of parmesan in case some might not take to its strong flavour.

Oh and there was ice cream plus a card bearing a note personally handwritten by the GM. 
And did I mention each lunch box was labelled with the recipientâ€™s name? ðŸ˜­ 
Thank you, boss!
