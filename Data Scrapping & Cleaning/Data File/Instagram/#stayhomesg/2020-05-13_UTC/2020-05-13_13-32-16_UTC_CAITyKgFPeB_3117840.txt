This Saturday evening we will have a live online instameet on zoom meeting with @lyricalight, @oh_nuahs and @mervkwok. We will have a casual chat about dance photography as they will share their experience, and perhaps we will pick up a few tips on how to capture the stunning dance pose, be it in a studio, on stage or even at the HDB void deck!

Mark your calendar and don’t miss it, we will announce the link to Zoom meeting about 15 minutes before the time, you can check on our insta story or in our Telegram broadcast channel. We recommend you to join from a laptop so you can have better view of the pictures that they will be sharing, although you can join from a mobile too if that’s more convenient for you. Come with a few questions too, ask what you have been curious about. See you on Saturday 9 PM!
