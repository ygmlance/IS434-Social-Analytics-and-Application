Our relationship with our children is the slow accretion of our daily interactions together.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
That is, EVERY interaction and conversation CREATES the relationship.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Our meal prep talks together, my response to them when they come to ask me questions while I am working on my laptop, my comments to them while we are doing pretend play, matter as much as those long conversations with them before bedtimes when there‚Äôs a problem.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
How we handle each of these situations is one brick in the foundation of our permanent relationship with our children, as well as our children‚Äôs perceived ideas about all relationships.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
That‚Äôs one huge reason why it‚Äôs worth thinking through any recurring interactions and conversations that get on our nerves to see how we might handle them differently (currently, ours is bedtime problems. that the two brothers are talking til late at night and refusing sleep üò¥). ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Interactions that happen more than once tend to initiate a pattern. Nagging and scolding shouldn‚Äôt have to be our default mode for a relationship with someone we love so much right? And besides, our life is too short for us to spend it in a state of annoyance, right? ü•¥‚Å£‚Å£
