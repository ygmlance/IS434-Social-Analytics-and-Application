Braised eggs | Beef | Tahini-Yogurt🍳🐮🍅☘️
.
🍴Overall ease: 7/10
.
🛒Ingredients: minced beef, cherry tomatoes, eggs, mixed spices, yogurt, tahini, coriander
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: referenced an @ottolenghi recipe from his #jerusalem cookbook, but substituted minced lamb for beef.
.
😋Taste: 10/10. This was one of the first dishes we made from our most loved cookbook #jerusalem, and is now a firm favourite! The spices, stewed with minced beef, formed a decadent base for the creamy, runny eggs and tang from the yogurt sauce. Almost like a shashuka, sans the tomato sauce?
