Do u feel groggy when you wake up in the morning?😴
.
Most of us Singaporeans lack sleep, and it’s usually out of our control. If there is difficulty improving sleep quantity, perhaps you can improve sleep quality instead. Better sleep quality = more rest during sleeping hours ☺️😌
.
Our hotel-inspired Four Seasons could be the solution you need. It’s ingredients include Magnolia that has calming properties and Sandalwood that helps with insomnia 🍃🌼⠀

Hope this helps! Sleep well! ❤️
