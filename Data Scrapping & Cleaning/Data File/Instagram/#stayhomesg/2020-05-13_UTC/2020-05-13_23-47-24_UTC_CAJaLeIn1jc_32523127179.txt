Basic sourdough 🍞
.
🍴Overall ease: 1/10
.
🛒Ingredients: 20% rye starter, bread flour, salt, water
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: same as always, but all done in 25-27 degrees (ie under aircon!), and with a shorter bulk ferment, longer cold retard, and as many stretch & folds, lamination, and coil folds needed!
.
😋Taste: 9/10. There are one too many bread posts (and too much bread!) but we’re too enthralled with improving our loaves! The focus for this bake was on getting a good oven spring, and considering how the loaves came out like mini soccer balls... I guess we can say we’re almost there? 😅 Next up, getting a more airy crumb!
