✏️ I started journaling when I first ventured into social entrepreneurship, facing high stress, disappointments and failures.  Busyness can easily cause us to sweep pent-up pressures under the carpet, which is unhealthy.

During those years, I was inspired by David's writing in Psalms in the Bible. I noticed he would write about his raw and honest feelings, yet he always ends off with praise for God (like a confident expectation of good). Journaling has given me a safe space to articulate my raw and unprocessed thoughts and emotions. It not only allows me to express myself in raw format but also to take a step back to process them in its entirety.

However, being too introspective, I find, can also lead to downward spiral of negative emotions, which could stem from self-condemnation. I find ending a raw conversation to God on journal with a bible verse helps shift my thoughts to God’s thoughts. After all, sometimes we perceive things in a certain way, but His thoughts are higher and better, and indeed we need the renewing of our minds. - R
