Thought i'd share some insights into what i've been going through not just during this CB but also the past few years of my life, and how it has moulded my perspectives in my creativity and in my life. it is some what of a more personal letter to all of you guys out there but also, something for you all to think over, be it if you're in the scene or not. i feel that theres something to takeaway from this trying and hard period. Peace & Love ya'll!

Also, @nydiashiang shared an article with me earlier today which i thought is an interesting insight as to what our future could be or look like! https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a32360709/coronavirus-music-industry/
