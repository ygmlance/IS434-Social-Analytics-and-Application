CCB Day 37/55- Who else actly find it hard to maintain a proper work life balance during this WFH? 👩🏻‍💻
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I realised I’m working harder and longer this period as I tend to eat + work at the same time so no proper lunch break. Also, the 💻 is usually in office = no choice gotta do it the next day. Now it’s w me 24/7. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Recently, I saw a video to change into work outfit to signal the brain when it’s working hours and when it’s not... and I think it helps!!

While it’s good to work hard, it’s always impt to maintain a good work life balance for your mental health so u don’t overwork. Rem to allocate proper rest time in between!
