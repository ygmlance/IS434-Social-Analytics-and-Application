This journey to Australia is a must as it was the first country that we travelled together with Raelyn when she was 3 months old and one of our recent trip last year too. 🇦🇺 We started by making our boomerang with q-tips . To enhance learning in the midst of creating, I used 2 dices where we throw a colour and a number to determine what goes on our boomerang, forming our rainbow boomerang. 🇦🇺 Next, we created the Sydney Opera house (using paper plates) with fireworks (white glue and glitters) on a starry night and the ocean (with sea creatures foam stickers from @evelynlimsl ) .
🇦🇺 This brought back memories where we witnessed the fireworks competition in Gild Coast last year. Now, which country will you choose to travel once this season is over? .
