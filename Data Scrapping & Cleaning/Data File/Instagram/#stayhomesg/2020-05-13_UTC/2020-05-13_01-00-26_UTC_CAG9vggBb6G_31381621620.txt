Living in insolation, it's normal to feel emotional, stressed, confused or angry during this pandemic.

Personally I have bouts of mood swings and even times where I feel a sense of emptiness.

The daily cycle of waking up, getting ready for home-based learning and repeating the next day made me feel like I'm just aimlessly running in circles.

However, there are somethings that keeps me busy and forward-looking. Honestly they're the really cliche quarantine tips like trying our a new hobby, reading a book and tidying up my room. 
So, I shall not be repeating all that to you, but hopefully the 3 tips I share in this post are those that are unique and more importantly, would be useful to you! üòâ‚ù§Ô∏è
