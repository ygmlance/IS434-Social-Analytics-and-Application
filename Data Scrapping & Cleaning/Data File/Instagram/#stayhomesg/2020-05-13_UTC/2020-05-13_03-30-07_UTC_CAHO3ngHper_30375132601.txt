"Probably the best choice I have made for my cats. He was severely matted with a personality to boot but Hanis was able to handle him very well! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
He came back clean, safe, and happy. Sincerely grateful to Hanis for taking such great care and attention to the grooming. Definitely have my recommendation!" - Kai Quan⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Do you know that Pawjourr also consolidates a list of groomers & their reviews (taken from Google & Facebook)? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We understand that it can be difficult for new pet parents to find a groomer, and smaller brands are often overshadowed by big brands with huge marketing budget. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Over at Pawjourr, we hope to empower local brands like @hanis_thegroomer. If you are looking for a groomer after CB, do check them out! ✨⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
