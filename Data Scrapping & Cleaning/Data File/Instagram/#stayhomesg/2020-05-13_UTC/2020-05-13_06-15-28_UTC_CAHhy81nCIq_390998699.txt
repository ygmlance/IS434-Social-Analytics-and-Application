Lunch came in a paper box of double goodness. ðŸ˜‹

Woke up at 830. BF. Sleep again. Woke up 930.. Baby also woke up. We giggled together on the bed. Put him in playpen while I pumped. He likes to flip over and stare over the playpen. Then I put him on the rocker and we ate breakfast together. He likes to watch me put things in my mouth..he thinks it's funny. After that we moved back to the bed, put him on the activity gym. Did some tummy time. BF again but baby didn't sleep so I couldn't cook and had to grab. I had a sudden craving for Nasi Lemak. Craving satisfied.  #mypineappledays_eatsg ðŸ˜‹
