Thai Prawn Glass Noodles (Tang Hoon)

My friends asked if I have repeated any dish during the CB. The answer is yes, and this is one of them. One of the family’s favourite dishes, I am always trying out different renditions of it.

Today’s recipe is from @spicenpans. The recipe title says ‘Super Yummy Thai Style Claypot Glass Noodles w Prawns’. Super yummy is right. My family says it’s the best version I have done. So guess this recipe is a keeper.

I doubled the portions of everything for 5-6 pax. It’s not difficult to prepare. But one of the key ‘issues’ of this dish is that it should be eaten as quickly as possible after it’s cooked. On a regular non CB day, everyone comes home/eats at different times. The green bean vermicelli can get clumpy and dry. So whilst we are all at home during this period, it’s a good opportunity to enjoy this.
