Circuit breaker Day 5: Picked up lunch from Whisk & Paddle! 👍👍 Not bad, at least it kinda feels like the weekend with cafe food and all. Ordered:
- Calamari
- Eggplant parmigiana
- Vongole linguine
- Crabmeat linguine
- Grilled chicken burger
- Classic beef burger
My favs were the pastas! 🍝 Grilled chicken burger was good too. Also got a 20% discount + free chocolate fudge cake for picking the food up.
