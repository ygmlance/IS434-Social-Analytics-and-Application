Logan and I spent half the day making this DIY playground/tree house with our leftover cardboard scrap & kitchen rolls! (While @vinodnair was working away.) We ran out of glue and improvised with scotch tape to complete the project. I left an empty space next to the big tree house so that we can build another level tmrw and perhaps build a suspension bridge too! We also made little people to play with!
