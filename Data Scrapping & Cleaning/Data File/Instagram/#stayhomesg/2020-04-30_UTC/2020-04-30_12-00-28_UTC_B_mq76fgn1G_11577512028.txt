Saw an amazing online deal for clothes while you’re staying at home and tempted to click on the ‘Checkout’ button? 🛒 You might want to think again – because you might end up contributing to the unsustainable craze behind fast fashion. 😱⠀
⠀
Why is fast fashion bad for the environment? Join us on Sun, 3 May at 2pm in our latest #GreenAtHomeSG event titled ‘Fast Fashion Frantic’ to find out!⠀
⠀
Besides infographics explaining the fast fashion 👕 problem, we’ve also planned a fast fashion trivia quiz 🙋 – and a unique ONLINE upcycling workshop ✂️ to teach you how to turn your old T-shirts into a new fabric coaster mat! ⠀
⠀
To participate, simply follow us on our Facebook or our Instagram or indicate your interest in our Facebook event (link in bio)!⠀

See you on Sunday at 2pm!⠀
