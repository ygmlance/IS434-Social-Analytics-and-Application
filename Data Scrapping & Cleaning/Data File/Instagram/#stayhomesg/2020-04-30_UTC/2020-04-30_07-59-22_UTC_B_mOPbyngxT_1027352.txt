When your friends can cook, you tend to eat very well. In the past week or so, I have been blessed with a couple of awesome meals (remember Annetteâ€™s Buah Keluak Biryani?).
Well, for lunch today, I had a very delicious surprise from @josephyeois. He had prepared his version of Soto for his family and decided to gift me some as well.
What I found impressive is how he created a chicken broth thatâ€™s clean-tasting yet so full of depth. Being ever the perfectionist in the kitchen (he was a chef at Les Amis years ago, and more recently, the Head Chef at #SPRMRKT), he made the effort to pack the broth separately. So when I was ready to eat, all I had to do was pour it into the bowl containing chunks of chicken, potatoes and carrots (these had been boiled in the aromatic chicken broth), glass noodles and bean sprouts. Naturally, he had all the condiments ready too. Thus, I was able to savour his #Soto with freshly fried shallots, chopped spring onions and a fiery chilli paste. 
And you know what else I found tucked in another bag? A box of the most darling Lemon #Madeleines baked by the man himself. I am proud to say my niece and I probably hold the world record now for speed-scoffing Madeleines ðŸ˜‚. #veronicaphuaeats #josephyeois #homechef #homebaker #burppletastemaker #burpproved #burpple #burpplesg #singaporefood #privatechef #gourmandisesg #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #igfood #igfoodie #tastespotting #forkyeah #foodiesofinstagram #foodlover #foodstagram #foodie #foodspotting #tastespotting #foodporn #foodinstagram #singapore #stayhomesg
