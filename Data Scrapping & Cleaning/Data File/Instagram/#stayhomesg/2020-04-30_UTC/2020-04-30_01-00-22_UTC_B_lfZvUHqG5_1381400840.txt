Stay home stay safe 🏠- it's been 24 days since the start of Circuit Breaker. Our worlds 🌎 may seem to have slowed down as we stay home and the light at the end of the tunnel may seem far off. But there's an undeniable glow and the warmth of seeing the nation 🇸🇬 rally together in this crisis. ⁣

Join us to support those in need with #MealOnMe and #StayHomeWithAscott, where CapitaLand Hope Foundation is donating to provide meals 🍱 for the underprivileged children, elderly and community care staff affected by COVID-19.⁣

Looking forward to when the green shoots 🎋 start springing up around the world, soon. To brighter days ahead! ☺ ⁣
