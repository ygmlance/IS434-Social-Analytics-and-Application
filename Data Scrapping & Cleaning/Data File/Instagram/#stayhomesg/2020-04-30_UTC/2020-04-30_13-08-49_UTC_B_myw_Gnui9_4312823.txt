For all the loved ones who enjoyed this bowl of 台湾卤肉饭, this is what a labour of love looks like. From the daikon, to the pork belly, to the egg.. Everything was filled with the immense amount of love I can conjure up at this moment of my life. ❤️ My bff always say I'm a perfectionist, I prefer to say "I am particular & I don't halfass whatever I do." and I mean it. How about you?

Do you know what a halfass effort looks like? Sometimes, staring into a mirror helps. It helped me.

Also, I had a failed kitchen experiment today. A kueh. But it's okayyyy, I'm gonna try again. . .
