This is a simple dish that I enjoy making as a side (or putting chicken on top to make a one-pan meal). It's essentially oven roasted vegetables (which you can do perfectly well on a normal sheet pan). But then, the #lecreuset looks really good in photos. 
If you have a #castironskillet though, a way to improve the results is to heat the skillet up first on the stove before putting your vegetables in. That helps to char the vegetables at the bottom (as opposed to just the top). Depending on how you want your vegetables, you may also consider crowding - less vegetables gives you a nice crispy exterior on each and a more roasted flavour, but more vegetables actually produces a pretty nice vegetable broth in the skillet that is tasty with toasted bread. 
Seasonings are very simple. Olive oil (probably more than you think you need), salt, pepper, chili flakes. If you have some lemon around, put a few wedges on to char and caramelise in the oven. Tomatoes roast up really nicely too. For this one I also used some sausage from Ryan's that added some additional flavour to it. Also had some fresh chillies chopped up. You could do garlic as well but make sure that is nestled in as it'll burn on the surface.
