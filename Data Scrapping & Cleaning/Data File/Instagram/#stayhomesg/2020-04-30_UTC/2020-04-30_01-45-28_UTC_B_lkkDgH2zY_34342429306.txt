How are you? 
The quote is from @najwazebian if you crave for something inspirational and empowering  words. Absolutely love it! I guess it doesn't just apply with pain but so does your habits that you want to change. I will take time but with hard work and consistency you will achieve.

Actually recently, someone ask me why I am doing this? I was caught in surprise and just laugh and walk away. Haha. But if I could answer it right now, here's a word I am not any way an expert or trying to be. An honest answer is I just want to create something of my own. I want to create my own "jar of happiness" I want to have something to look back to even if it has been a challenge. That's it.
I encourage everyone to do the same, it doesn't have to be done in a certain way. Just do you.
