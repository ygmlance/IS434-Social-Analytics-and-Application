Tauhu Begedil || I totally sympathise with @chrissyteigen when she described how hard it was to get a recipe from her mom. From my mom / grandmother, it is ‘just add till it tastes nice’ 🤷‍♀️ or ‘agak agak one fist’. Erm, Hope’s fist or mine?! Anyone feels me 🙋🏻‍♀️😂 It took me 4 tries to perfect the sambal but it was worth it cos it’s all in the sauce!!! .
Although my tauhu begedil and sauce doesn’t match up to my favourites @bakeology_sg and @evaroslan ‘s ones - I’ll make do till #CB ends. For those who have yet to try, it’s basically tofu stuffed with potato and meat- and it’s heavenly! Made it with my grandma’s basic begedil recipe (also in highlights).
