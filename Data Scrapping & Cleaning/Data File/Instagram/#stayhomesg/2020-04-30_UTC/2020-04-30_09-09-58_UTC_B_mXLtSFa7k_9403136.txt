Today was about testing my one set max rep push up since starting my workouts a few days ago. Did 30 reps with pretty good form. No chicken wings, straight back and tight core, full extension and deep dip. Could have pushed a little harder and done a few more but itâ€™s a good base to start from. #calisthenicsbasics #calisthenics #stayhomeforsg #stayhomesg #joochcycles
