New recipe 23— Orange Phirni

I usually make phirni and it’s a great rich flavoured dessert, which is super easy to prepare. What made me impressed was adding orange juice to it. It gave a new punch to te original taste. 
This rich dessert has soaked and coarsely grounded basmathi rice cooked in milk and sugar. To enhance te flavour used cardamom pods. Adding a bit of saffron gives nice color. 
Once it becomes porridge, allow it to cool completely. 
Finally te added star ingredient , orange zest and orange juice. 
Gave a lavish sprinkle of nuts 🙌🏼🙌🏼 #foodie #newrecipes #cookinglove #circuitbreaker #stayhomesg
