Sun’s up! It’s been raining quite often lately, we enjoy the rain but we wanted to bring a little sunshine into the home too so we created our own. Harley wanted to contribute too! He bent his body over to tell me he wanted to paint too! ☀️ #followingjoy #followthechild #rainydayactivities #toddlerlife #babylife #artandcraft #homesweethome #sunshine #sunnyday #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited
