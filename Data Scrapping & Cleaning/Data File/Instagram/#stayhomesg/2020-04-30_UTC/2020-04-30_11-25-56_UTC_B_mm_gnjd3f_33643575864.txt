Mindfulness isn't complicated, but it does take work. Right now much of the personal time that used to be part of our daily routines — like commutes, or even going to the coffee shop — is not available. This means it’s extra important to be intentional about creating time to recharge and practice mindfulness. We can't control what's going on with the pandemic crisis, but mindfulness helps train your brain on how to tolerate the uncertainty.
