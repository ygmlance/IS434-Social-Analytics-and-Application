Pausing ... till these dark clouds of uncertainty blow over. For now, as per the URA regulations on the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 for home-based businesses, I am unable to fulfil any more orders till 1 June or till further notice. This time will be spent in testing, playing, and dreaming of better ideas & products, for that is what a pause button is for. Iâ€™m hopeful that we will get through this and emerge stronger than ever. .
