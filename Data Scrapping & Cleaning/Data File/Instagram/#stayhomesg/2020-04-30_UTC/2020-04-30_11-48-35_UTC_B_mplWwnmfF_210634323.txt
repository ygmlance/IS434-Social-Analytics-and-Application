#day23 #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg I managed to conduct my meeting successfully! All thanks to @tai.tylee ! ☺️ Thank you for taking her for a car ride while I’m having meeting and putting her to sleep cos she’s super sticky to me recently.. she’s addicted to pouring the green bean and sticking it recently. Kept asking us to draw the different Pororo characters. 🙄 Lexa helped me to pluck the vegetables, wash them and we harvest our one mushroom to eat!
