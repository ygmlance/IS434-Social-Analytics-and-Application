This is my bliss, snuggling in bed with my monkeys! Just thankful for these kids who loves hugs and who keep the house lively with non-stop chatter ðŸ™‰. .
When will kids (esp boys) stop wanting hugs and snuggles from their mothers? The other day my older child refused to use earphones because they are pink; he didnâ€™t used to mind at all, in fact pink was his fave colour last time!.
