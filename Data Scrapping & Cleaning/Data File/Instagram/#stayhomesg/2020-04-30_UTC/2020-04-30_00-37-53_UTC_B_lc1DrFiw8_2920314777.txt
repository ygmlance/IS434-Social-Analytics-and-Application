#stayhomesg: Quick simple dessert for the hot weather...
Serving chilled Lemongrass Coconut Milk Agar Agar with Aloe Vera. First attempt using this combination. Never fear trying, sometime there will new beautiful discoveries.

Over the years, I discovered few short cuts to speed up making this Agar Agar (Jelly). One thing I knew, for some dishes, don't follow the recipe blindly. As different kitchen, different utensils, different products, there is a need to explore and adjust accordingly.

Normally, I will made either plain Agar Agar(Jelly) with pandan favour (using pandan leaves). Occasionally, have a coconut milk added version (equally simple to do). #sgvegetarian #sgvegan #dessert #agaragar
