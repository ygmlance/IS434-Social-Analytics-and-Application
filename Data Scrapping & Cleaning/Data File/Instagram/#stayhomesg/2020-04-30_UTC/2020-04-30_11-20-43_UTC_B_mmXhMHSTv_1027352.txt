After treating our Muslim friends to the #DulangAmbengRoyal from @pu3restaurant, I decided to order one for ourselves as well since they‚Äòd raved about the food, and frankly, I have been eager to try this place since forever. Truly ecstatic to have done so because it was pure joy to eat. Partly because I have been missing my Nasi Padang for a while now.
Shown above is the platter for 2 pax ($36) and it‚Äòs massive. I reckon up to 3 people could share it actually. Anyway, all around the big mound of rice is an assortment of tastiness. My favourites from this ‚Äúring of fire‚Äù (ok, I may be exaggerating because not every item was fiery üòÜ) were the Daging #Rendang (love, love, love the ridiculously fragrant and tender beef), the #Paru Goreng Rempah (spices-marinated cow‚Äôs lungs - the main reason I am crazy for #NasiPadang), the Ikan Kering (crispy dried salted fish) and the Ayam Lemak Cili Padi (its gravy is sublime on rice or simply to slurp). The Udang Sambal Belado Hijau was also delicious but I wish there was more of the sambal. Ditto the Terong Sambal Belado. But that‚Äôs just me nitpicking because frankly, I‚Äôd be happy to feast on this again in another week or two.
