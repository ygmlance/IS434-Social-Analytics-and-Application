THIS KIMCHI GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH WAS SO GOOD. Think savoury stretchy melted cheese with kimchi oozing out of sinfully buttery and crispy toast ü§§ Ok I LOVE such simple and quick recipes - thanks @8days_eat again üòç Always having cheese in the freezer at home is TRULY A GREAT IDEA üòõ

RECIPE: (1) Slather butter on one side of each bread and place them onto the frying pan (medium heat) with the butter side facing down. (2) Add mozzarella and cheddar on both slices of bread. (3) Once the cheese melts, add kimchi on one slice of the bread. (4) Place the other bread on top of the one with kimchi, with its cheese side facing down. (5) Grill and flip your sandwich a few times to make sure both sides are grilled well! ü•™
