Day 24 of circuit breaker, a dance off with Leodys. Sometime Leodys will suddenly pop out to the floor and started to shout “HEAD”. If I continue to sing the sing, he will continue to dance all the way through. Although I had been telling him that after HEAD is SHOULDER, he will still skip it. Nowadays he really like to dance, sometime just stomping his foot or spinning around. I will cherish this cute moments of him. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #dancedancebaby #dancingbaby #headshoulderskneesandtoes #hbl #homebasedlearning #wfh #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #hshthuz
