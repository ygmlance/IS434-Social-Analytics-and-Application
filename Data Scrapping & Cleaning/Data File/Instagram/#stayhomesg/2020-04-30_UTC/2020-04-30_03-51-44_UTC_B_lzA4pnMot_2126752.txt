Post workout stretch in my new Everywear Leggings in Dark Cherry from @anya.active! Absolutely impressed with the super comfy, buttery soft and extra stretchy material that stood the tests of all my workouts & stretch poses.

Stretching is so important. It improves posture, reduces bloating, relieves stress, keeps muscles strong + flexible (we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motions), elongates tight muscles so they don’t get bulky from the workout, reduces chance of injuries, aids soreness recovery and improves blood circulation. So don’t forget to spend a few mins to cool down and stretch after every sweat sesh!
