💝It may be late but the thought is what counts more.⁠
.⁠
Because of the enhanced circuit breaker restrictions, we are unable to despatch our soaps until the restrictions are eased. So chances are, Mother's Day soaps 📦deliveries will be late.⁠
.⁠
A thoughtful gift 🎁is what matters more. At least that's what we believe. ⁠
.⁠
For the selfless mum 🙍who always puts the priorities of everybody else first, who quietly manages the whole household from the moment she wakes, so seamlessly that we have no idea how much she does in a day until she goes on a rare vacation one day.⁠
.⁠
For the mum who doesn't have #selfcare 💆‍♀️in her dictionary. Or the mum who loves her self-care but doesn't have time for it. It's time to pamper her and show her you care.⁠❤️
.⁠
Gift her some all-natural cold process soaps 🧼 that cleanse with #nonasties and make her showers🚿 more relaxing with essential oils. Let the natural oils in the soap soothe and condition her skin.⁠
.⁠
🛒 Preorder on our Etsy store and we will despatch your soaps the moment the restrictions are eased. #stayhomesg⁠
