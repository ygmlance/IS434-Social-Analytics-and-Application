⁣This never made it on screen but for my final audition to join Masterchef, I made a huge pot of gochujang beurre monte(which required a ridiculous amount of butter), then poached salmon in it at a low temperature until it had an almost mi-cuit consistency. I served it on sautéed vegetables and salmon skin that had been crisped up in an oven. ⠀

Its funny to look back on the food I used to do back then because I can't imagine doing those dishes now anymore, I don't think I'll make it again but I actually do love the sauce, it's rich from all the butter but the spice from the gochujang actually cuts through the fat quite nicely. ⠀

Reusing that idea, this is Cod with crispy scales, pomme puree, gochujang beurre monte with vegetable brunoise
