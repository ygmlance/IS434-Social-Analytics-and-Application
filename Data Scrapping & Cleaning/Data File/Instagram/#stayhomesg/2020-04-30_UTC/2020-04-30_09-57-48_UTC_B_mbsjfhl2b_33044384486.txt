We know that the past weeks of Circuit Breaker and stricter measures have made some people gone ga-ga with disruptions to lifestyle and schedules. It’s Labour Day tomorrow, and while our frontline heros and heroines have to continue fighting the battle for us, let’s do our part by staying home and give yourself a good break too. Do nothing, or do something you like. For us, perhaps we will cook some 🍝. Enjoy your Labour Day weekend! 
Psss.. did you notice that is actually made of spaghetti? We secretly love the hairdo 🤪#thelunaspace
