Not sure why I keep coming back to these bridging forms, of late. I think it is a response to our current situation. Separated. Divided. Desperate. It feels like it’s trying desperately to bridge two hopeless beautiful decaying forms. Really starting to dig the smooth 70cm x 100cm(W) Fabiano Drawing Paper surfaces. It’s able to take some light graphite water washes without warping the paper too much. For more of these lockdown inspired works.
