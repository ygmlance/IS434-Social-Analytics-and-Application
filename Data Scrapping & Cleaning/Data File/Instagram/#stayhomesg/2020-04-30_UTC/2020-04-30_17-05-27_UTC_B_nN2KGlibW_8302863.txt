I bake more often these days, especially because I have a baking buddy in the house - Gabriel! 😀🧑🏻‍🍳
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
He enjoys helping around in the kitchen.
He was upset yesterday, when he woke up from his nap, I was done baking. He then declared that he wouldn’t take a nap anymore 🤭
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Today before he took a nap I told him, we would bake something yummy and I would wait for him to wake up.
So while he took a nap I prepared all the ingredients for him to pour, mix, stir, etc.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I have learnt that preparations (ingredients, materials, mental 🤪, etc.) and low expectations are keys when baking with kids 😅😀
Instead, seize the opportunity to bond, create memories and enjoy the process!💕
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So here it is Fudgy Chocolate Brownie - A quick chocolate fix to end the night 🍫..
A memory of Gabriel and mama baking together 👩🏻‍🍳🧑🏻‍🍳🥰💕
