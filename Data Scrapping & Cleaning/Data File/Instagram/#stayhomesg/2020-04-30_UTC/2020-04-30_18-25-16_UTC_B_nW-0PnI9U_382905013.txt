Start of a long weekend in #Singapore but due to the #coronavirus thereâ€™s not the usual partying, dinners with friends, heck, even our favourite #McDonalds and #bubbletea shops are now closed.

But as we look out the window tonight every lit up house means we are one step closer to overcoming this together as #SGunited

Because #stayingapart does make us #strongertogether
