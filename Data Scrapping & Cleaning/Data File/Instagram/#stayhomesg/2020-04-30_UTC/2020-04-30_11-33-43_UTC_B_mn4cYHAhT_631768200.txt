Day 24 dinner for Circuit breaker. 一粥一菜。
Brown rice porridge & vegetables.
When i wake up in the morning realised it is Buddha birthday,  初八 day 8 of lunar month. I rather observe and follow it.
Not much of vegetarian ingredient i have.
I still have cauliflower. Recently bought spicy sasame oil. Used it to stirred fried this vegetables. Not bad.
The sauce 汁 is very good to drizzle on a bowl of rice 淋饭.
Top my porridge with this Wakame. Very nice.
The Wakame is season with sasame seeds & sugar. Sweet one. 甜甜的. Can't use furikake.
This will do.
If not vegetarian day i usually include eggs to my meal. Today cannot.
Simple eat 简单吃.  Lesser dishes to wash up too.
😁
