#circuitbreaker day 23, what have you guys been up to? I’ve been staying home and working on creating a simpler life. It’s the third month I’m into the concept of minimalist and mindful living. To some, minimalist could mean owning just a certain amount of clothes or items. However to me, it’s more about keeping only the things that adds value into my life. Slowly your needs and wants become clearer and this includes your relationship with people. You’ll learn to let go of people who don’t really make you feel good. Your awareness of who and what you wanna bring into your life heightens, and if any of you are trying to simplify your life too, this is a good start.
