🌤One must never look for happiness; one meets it by the way. 🌤 Sometimes, things or memories are more beautiful because they came unexpectedly! 🥰 Today’s breakfast is yummy! Madeleines (again) from last night + Ritz cheese crackers (another childhood ❤️), very sweet blueberries and Kyoho grapes! Special mention to the Starbucks premium instant coffee: 3-in-1 Caramel latte! I bought them from NTUC: 4 sachets at $4.75. A little expensive but definitely a very cheap alternative to the real brewed one at Starbucks! They have several flavors: Cappucino, Caffe Latte, Caffe Mocha, Caramel Latte, Matcha Latte and Vanilla Latte! Now I feel like buying 1 of each- maybe I need to go NTUC again tonight! 🤪 I seriously wonder how much I would have spent in NTUC at the end of CB? 🤔🤔🤔
