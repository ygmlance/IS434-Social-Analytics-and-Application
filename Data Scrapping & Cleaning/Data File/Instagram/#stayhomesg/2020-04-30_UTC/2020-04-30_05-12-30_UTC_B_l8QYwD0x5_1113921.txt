[Ah Orh Seafood] - Missing the Teochew food from one of my favourite Chinese restaurants. Great that they are available for island wide delivery now. They even have set menu $45 for 3 dishes and $55 for 4 dishes.
.
I had the Braised Duck, Fish Maw Soup, Stir-Fried Vegetable with Oyster Sauce, Oyster Omelette and Orh Nee. .
