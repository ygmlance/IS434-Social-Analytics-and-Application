Nicolas Potel Meursault 1er Cru Les Cras 1015

This Meursault 1er Cru cannot compare to Domaine Coche-Dury or Domaine des Comtes Lafon. 
Rich and sumptuous, with the creamy silky balanced style lending itself to being enjoyed at a young age.

Initially was rather restrained and after decanting for some time, it slowly open up especially serving at 13- 15°C.

I loved  the style of oak influence, with "buttery", nose with a hint of vanilla and coconut. À votre santé!
