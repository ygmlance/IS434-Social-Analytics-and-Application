@Huphup.co ‚Äòs must-try dishes (Laksa, Mee Siam and Lor Mee) are available for delivery!üòã‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
The Laksa was mind-blowing, with a rich and fragrant broth, paired with al dente vermicelli. Topped with generous servings of ingredients (like cockles, fishcake and tau pok), every mouthful of this Laksa just kept me going for more! Dangerously addictive‚Ä¶‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£üëå‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
The Mee Siam had a good balance of sweetness and spiciness. I love it because it isn‚Äôt too spicy and it was just right. For people who prefer something spicier, you can simply add on @huphup.co ‚Äòs amazing chilli! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all Mee Siam lovers! This really deserves the top 10 spot in Singapore!‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£üëç‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
Lastly, to all Lor Mee fans, this Lor Mee will definitely not disappoint! The Lor Mee's gravy was just right, thick but not starchy. Oh and the succulent braised pork belly was heavenly! The whole dish came together so well!‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚ù§Ô∏è‚Å£‚Å£
