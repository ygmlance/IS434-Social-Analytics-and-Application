Almost one month into the circuit breaker, howâ€™s everyone coping and easing into your new life? The most difficult thing to do when I am working from home is to know when to end my work day. I try to make it a point to schedule plans for yoga on some week day evenings cos the dining chair that I am sitting on all day long is hardly ergonomic and leaves me with back and shoulder aches. And also weekly HIIT classes with @strength.in.curves, let me know if you are keen to join me in the next class on Tuesday evening! .
