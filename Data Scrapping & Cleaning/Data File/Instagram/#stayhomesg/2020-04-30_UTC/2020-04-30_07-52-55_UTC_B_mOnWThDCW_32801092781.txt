Circuit breaker Day 24: Chicken wings, black pepper pork chop & fish from Uno Beef House 👍👍👍 Highlight is definitely the chicken wings, sooooo crispy & juicy, batter was light. Very delicious even after dabaoing & sitting in a paper bag for 20mins. The fried mashed potato balls were interesting & tasty too. Ok but don’t think I’ll get the fish next time. All this cost just $26.50!!
