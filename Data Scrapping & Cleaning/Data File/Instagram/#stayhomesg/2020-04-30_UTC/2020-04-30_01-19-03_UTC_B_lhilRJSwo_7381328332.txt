KNEE ROTATION - iS IT A STRETCH OR A WARM UP?

NON AT ALL. FROM THE ANATOMY OF A KNEE, THE MUSCLE FIBERS ARE VERTICALLY ALIGNED WHETHER IT'S DISTAL OR PROXIMAL TO THE JOINT. THE ONLY STRETCHING IS TO STRETCH THE FIBERS ALONG THE IT'S ALIGNMENT. ROTATING THE KNEE?? EVEN IF YOU WANT TO DO WARM UP TO GET MORE BLOOD FLOW TO THE JOINT, U CAN PROBABLY DO A LIGHT HOP OR JUMP OR JOG ON THE SPOT....GET YOUR BODY WARM UP AND GET THE FIRST FEW BEADS OF PERSPIRATION. CONCLUSION, KNEE ROTATION DOES NOT SERVE MUCH PURPOSE. .
