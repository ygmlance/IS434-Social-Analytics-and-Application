Egg in a hole toast!! 🍳🥪
This recipe is so so easy and fun to make and I think kids would enjoy this as much as we do! Y’all can plan to wake up a little earlier this weekend and start your day with this~ Add any kind of toppings and ingredients you like. My favorite part is jiggling my eggs and dipping my toast into the yolk 😋 #ShersVideoRecipes #StayHomeWithAscott
