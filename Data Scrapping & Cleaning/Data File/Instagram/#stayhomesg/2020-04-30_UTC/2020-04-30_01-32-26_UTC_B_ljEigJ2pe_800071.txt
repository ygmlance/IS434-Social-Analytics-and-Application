➊ [Brown Sugar Fresh Milk Boba S$4.95] 
➋ [1983 Boba Milk Tea S$4.45] - I want to keep all three bbtea to myself but I have to share with my family. So I had this instead. Always a milk tea person, the pearls are on the harder side but still okay, not that bad, in my opinion it’s not bad for something that’s coming from a non-bbtea shop. 
➌ [Honey Fresh Green Tea S$3.95] 
➍ [Sweet Plum Potato Fries S$4.45] - still my fav here at shihlin! Still crispy after I finished lunch. And every piece is evenly coated with the plum powder.

➎ [XXL Crispy Chicken S$6.45] 
➏ [Happy! Rice Box S$8.95]
