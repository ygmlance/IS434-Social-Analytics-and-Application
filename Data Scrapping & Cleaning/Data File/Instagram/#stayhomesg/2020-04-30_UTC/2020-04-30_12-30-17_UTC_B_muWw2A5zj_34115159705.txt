If you are asking, “How do I give my support to a local restaurant?”, it’s really easy and is something that can definitely be incorporated into your daily life. It is as easy as getting your usual morning latte from a local coffee joint instead of Starbucks. You benefit from getting freshly roasted coffee probably from fair-trade sources and the coffee joint benefit by keeping those dollars you spent within the local economy. 
Also, it doesn’t help that third-party food delivery services are charging them a huge amount of commission. The best thing you can do is actually to just order directly from the restaurants, pick-up the food yourself and save them from the extra charges!
