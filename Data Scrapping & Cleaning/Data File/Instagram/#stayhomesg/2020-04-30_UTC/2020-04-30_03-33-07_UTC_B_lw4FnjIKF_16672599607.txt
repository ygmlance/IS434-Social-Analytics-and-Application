Breaking Circuit D24...
The emerald tree right in front of my nose is blooming. Fuzzie catkins. Never seen it beforeðŸ™ˆ. Or at leastÂ  not consciously....Compos mentis is in full bloom as well. Or I am a bit too zen... glad that perpetual oblivion has not entered. Senses are used better. Perception of surroundings is heighted. Perhaps this is the time to develop an extrasensory one....Psychokinesis, the real deal!
