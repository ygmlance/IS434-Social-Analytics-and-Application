Having some pancake cravings... so here it goes 🥞 #homemade #pancakes #stayhomeforsg #stayhomesg 
In case you are interested, here’s the recipe and share pictures with me if you do make it 🙂

Combine the dry and wet ingredients separately and mix them together. The texture should be well mixed but still lumpy. Pour the batter into the stove for 1 pancake and flip when it bubbles. Makes 5 pancakes.
