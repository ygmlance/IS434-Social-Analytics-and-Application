It’s been donkey weeks since we last step out of the house as we have been totally spoiled with tons of foods and home essential deliveries! It’s so super convenient, just a few clicks and all we have to do is to wait for the delivery to arrive! Today we make a short 5-10 mins walk for some fresh air, Vitamin D and to tapao a pack of fragrant and yummy Roasted Chicken with Roast Pork Belly rice! A simple but comforting lunch!! Love their chicken rice as their rice isn’t too oily and texture is perfect, roast chicken is nicely roasted and tender and they don’t add too much oil and gravy to it! Goes so well with their chilli sauce that’s so shiok! .
