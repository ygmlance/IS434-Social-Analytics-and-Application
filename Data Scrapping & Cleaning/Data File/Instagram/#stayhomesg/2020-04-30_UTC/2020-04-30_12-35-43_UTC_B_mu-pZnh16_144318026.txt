#hb day 24: Be flexible and go with the flow of the day?ðŸ˜†
We salvaged our rice from weevils by cleaning multiple times and soaking overnight. Then cooked with garlic, coriander roots and lemongrass. Alas, it was still uncooked so we added water and became soggy rice. So racked brain and turned it into meatball porridge for lunch.  We also tried a new recipe, green papaya with chicken thighs and manis vegetables. It turned out  savoury pleasantly refreshing chicken broth!
We give thanks for salvaged porridge to reduce food waste. 
Another hbl conquered! YAY to labour day! 
Have a good rest everyone! Time to cease labouring on labour day.
