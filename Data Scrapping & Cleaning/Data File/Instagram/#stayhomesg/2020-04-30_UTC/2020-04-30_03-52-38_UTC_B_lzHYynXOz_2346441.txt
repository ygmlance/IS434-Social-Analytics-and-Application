Day 24 of #circuitbreaker: I am one of those who rushed to @decathlonsg to buy home workout equipment when the circuit breaker news broke. Haha and I bought this! 🤣 Easy to use and works my arms & core muscles. Won’t take up much space coz u can dismantle for keeping 👍⁣

You don’t need to feel trapped coz @decathlonsg is really a one-stop shop for all sporting gears! Continue staying fit and healthy, and we have a few more weeks till #circuitbreaker ends!⁣
