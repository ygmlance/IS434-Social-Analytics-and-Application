Never imagined we’d attend virtual birthday parties. The 1yo prolly thinks this is just another Tv show, while the 3yo had just 1 concern; she wanted a slice of the cake & couldn’t figure out how to get one.

Strange times we are in, I count my blessings that we are all in a good place. But there are many who are far worst off. People keep saying we’re all in the same boat. Actually we aren’t. We are all simply in it at the same period of time, but the degree of which we are affected varies significantly. More than ever, lets all extend that helping hand, show appreciation, be gracious. Times like these let’s make a positive impact, one small action at a time. #CircuitBreaker #stayhomesg
