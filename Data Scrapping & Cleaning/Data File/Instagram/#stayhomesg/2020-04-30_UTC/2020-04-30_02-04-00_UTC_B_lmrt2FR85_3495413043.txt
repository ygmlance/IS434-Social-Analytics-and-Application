A few days ago, I fell deeply in love with this stunning plate of maggie goreng. This popular restaurant is known for its crispy prata - and I really think they serve one of the best pratas in Singapore. But who would have guessed that their fried noodles is so good too? With the perfect egg centered on a runny yolk as gorgeous as a rising sun, the noodles are heavenly stir fried with mixed vegetables in greasy harmony. Yes my cholesterol probably shot through the unhealthy roof with this carbo-filled meal of prata and noodles combo! But I still crave for another serving of fried noodles with an unwise gluttony deathwish. .
