Was craving for something matcha watching all these matcha dalgona lattes üòç. Bought myself a very expensive bottle of matcha powder and decided it shouldn‚Äôt go to waste. ‚Å£
‚Å£
After researching what I think I might be able to bake, this seems like the most worthy recipe armed and ready with my newly found skills. ‚Å£
‚Å£
It was slightly more burned than it should be I think it might have been coz my pan was a little bigger. It was slightly on the bitter side for me but it was a hit with the husband and Rey. She even asked for a second helping after dinner. ‚Å£
‚Å£
I think it might just go with the sweetness of dalgona coffee tomorrow for breakfast. üôÉ‚Å£
‚Å£
As usual, link to the recipe I followed on my highlights.‚Å£
