Made tonkatsu for lunch today. Tedious preparation but it turned out well. Pounded >400 times per piece, made our own breadcrumb with Gardenia enriched white bread, pickled daikon radish, and miso soup boiled with anchovies and daikon. It was also the first time we deep fry something instead of the healthier options.

Japanese tonkatsu
The day before: pound & season the meat with salt when you bought it.
On the cooking day, prepare:
a) a plate of all-purpose flour.
b) a plate of 1 egg and 1/2 tbsp of oil for each piece. Whisk.
c) a plate of toasted breadcrumb or panko.
Dip the meat in
a) All-purpose flour. Use a small brush to remove excess flour.
b) Egg mixture.
c) Breadcrumb. Once it is fully covered, press it hard with your palm.
Heat oil in a wok over medium high heat till 180C.
Deep fry tonkatsu for 45 sec on each side.
Let the tonkatsu rest on a wire rack for 4 mins by holding it vertically.
Deep fry it for another 30 sec on each side.
Let the tonkatsu rest on the wire rack again till oil has been drained.

Tonkatsu sauce
Mix 1 tbsp ketchup, 3 tsp Jap brand Bulldog Worcestershire sauce, 1.5 tsp oyster sauce together.

Cabbage salad
Slice half small head cabbage into thin strips.

Place them in a plate and add baby tomatoes.

Boil anchovies in 1 liter of water over low heat for 30 mins.
Slice daikon and add in the soup.
Soak kelp. Cut and add in the soup.
Boil for another 1-1.5 hours.

Dissolve miso paste slowly. Don't over boil it.
