Since I told Arielle this morning that I planned to bake apple cookies 🍎🍪 with her, she's been bugging me the whole day about it. We finally decided to do the baking and although we had eliminated some ingredients like nutmeg and almonds, the cookies still turned out really well! We got a thumbs up from everyone in the family 👍🏻
