Lights, camera, action! May every aspect of your life be as luminous and exciting as the lights flickering on the lamps (or cams) in the festival of lights .

To add on to my previous post about “be proud”, I present a reflection of myself, behind the camera (albeit a crocheted one haha) I’m like many, I doubt myself at times, yet during others I feel happy and accomplished. All of us have to learn to love ourselves, for who we are, entirely. Because if you don’t, people won’t appreciate you for who you are. Embarking on a journey of self discovery since last year and I haven’t regretted at all, as I continue to build confidence in myself and my works. A little hug and virtual ❤️ for anyone who needs it!! (Esp during this circuit breaker season)
