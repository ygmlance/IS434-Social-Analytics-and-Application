Missing this Tau Kwa Pau - a deep-fried tofu stuffed with lots of chopped braised meat, egg, fried yam, fried fish cake and cucumber.
.
This is from the famous Say Seng Tau Kwa Pau stall at Dunman Market, and they are really generous with their ingredients.👍 Too bad we don't live nearby, else can go there to buy... Never mind, after Circuit Breaker ends!
