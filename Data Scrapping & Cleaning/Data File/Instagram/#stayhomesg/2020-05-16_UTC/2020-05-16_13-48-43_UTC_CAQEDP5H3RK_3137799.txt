Thank you @elvinfoong for loving me in very giving ways. Last Sunday, we celebrated mother's day for and with mummies and families from everywhere. We invited dads to surprise their wives by suddenly appearing on screen to say words of appreciation!

Why did I say this is @elvinfoong 's way of showing me love? Because he need not always like going on screen and on special occasions, he may prefer some private moments. However, he knew my mother's day wish is to celebrate mums and be a blessing by having a little online party sing-along and he agreed readily and happily. My love tank is filled!

Thank you, dearie. Love you!
