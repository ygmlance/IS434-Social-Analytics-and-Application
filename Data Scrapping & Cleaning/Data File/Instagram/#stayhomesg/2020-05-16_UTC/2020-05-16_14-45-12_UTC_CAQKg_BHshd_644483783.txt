#Mealprep sounds like the antithesis of fresh food, but for me it is a better option than fresh yet less-healthy meals (I’m looking at you, McDonald’s). I’ve seen some videos of professional meal preppers - hired to go to their clients’ homes to transform a fridge of ingredients into a week of delicious meals for an entire family!

Being a servantless Asian non-chef (to paraphrase the immortal Julie Child), it falls upon my own hands (and my kitchen equipment) to do the same on Sundays for the week ahead.

This particular round was:
1. Rice with Brand’s Essence, eggplant, chicken (rice cooker)
2. Roast chicken & potatoes (oven)
3. Pork bone soup brewed overnight (thermal pot). And for Sunday #lockdowndinners, I usually make a fresh bowl of something - which in this case was Nyonya #currylaksa (from the packet, my cooking non-skills only go so far...) with chives and rice-cooker onsen egg.

I ate very well for that week! (￣ω￣)
