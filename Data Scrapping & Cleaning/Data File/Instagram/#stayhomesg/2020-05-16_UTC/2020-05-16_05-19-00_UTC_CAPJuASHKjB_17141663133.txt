Take a peek into JCCâ€™s kitchens! In Japan, gyoza (pan-fried dumplings) can be found in many restaurants and home kitchens. Likewise, a dumpling dish that is ubiquitous in Singapore is wonton! ðŸ¥Ÿ One of our staff made wontons this week. Together with her mother, she wrapped a homemade mix of minced pork, prawns, and chopped up water chestnuts (for a bit of crunch in the texture!) into wonton skins and shaped them into envelopes. Once prepared, the wontons can be kept refrigerated until you want to eat them!

Wontons can be eaten in various ways too! They can be fried (like they are in this photo) or boiled to be enjoyed with a delicious, clear soup. Itâ€™s a simple recipe with many variations, so why not try making your own wontons this week? ðŸ˜‹
