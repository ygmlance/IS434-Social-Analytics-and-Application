The Challenge concludes... ...after 67 days⁠.
.⁠
The 400ml bottle of body wash 🚿is depleted and the bottle is washed out to be reused while this brand new bottle replaces its predecessor.⁠

@mynakedbar Turmeric Sunrise 🌅 bar 🧼is down to a last few mm and so thin that it is almost too delicate to hold and keep its shape. But you can still clearly see the yellow ombre layers from the turmeric.
.⁠
67 days...it is actually quite an even match. Our good old #barsoap probably won 🥇by a couple of days.⁠
.⁠
However, if we consider the planet 🌏and a future for our children👫, the bar soap is an outright winner. 🏆Cos the bar soap diminishes into practically 'nothing', while we now have an empty bottle to settle.⁠
.⁠
Some might say we can ♻️#reuse, #upcycle, #recycle the bottle. But according to @mewrsingapore , only 4% of the close to 900K tonnes of plastic waste in 2019 was recycled. Possibly a handful are up-cycled or #reused by individual or group eco-champions, but the large proportion of the 96% have simply joined our one and only landfill, the same one that is due to fill up in 15 years.⁠ #savesemakau

If you've never considered swapping to a bar of soap, will you open up your mind to try? We'd be keen to hear what might be holding you back too if you are open to share with us in our last post ⬇️.
