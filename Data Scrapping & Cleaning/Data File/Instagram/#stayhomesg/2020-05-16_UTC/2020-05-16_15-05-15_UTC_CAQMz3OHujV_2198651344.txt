[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Someone in the house is very particular about not leaving hot food in plastic containers, so we will usually quickly pour out these piping hot noodles into a large ceramic bowl once we reach home. üòÖ
.
Tonight's dinner: @PuTien_SG's Lor Mee üçú (S$18.60 for the 2 servings pictured here)! This is one of our all-time favourites and we have ordered this takeaway numerous times from the @Nex.SG outlet when we head there for our supermarket errands.
.
The portion is very generous with pork belly, prawns, clams, sliced mushrooms, mini tau poks and veggies, and we usually drink up all the yummy pork broth. This is comfort food for us. What's yours? ‚ù§Ô∏è

PS: Putien is now offering 20% off for all ala-carte takeaways!
