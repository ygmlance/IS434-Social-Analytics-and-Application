Here are THREE reasons why we need a dedicated workspace and preferably free from domestic distractions: ⠀
⠀
1. Achieve optimal work performance in a space built to your preference. ⠀
⠀
2. Optimize your space further so you are away from unnecessary noises or anything that would steal your focus. ⠀
⠀
3. Physically leave your dedicated 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠𝙨𝙥𝙖𝙘𝙚 - so you are telling yourself to stop work and get on to your other responsibilities in life! ⠀
⠀
