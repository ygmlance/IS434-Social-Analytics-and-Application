I'm one of those girls who have a whole Pinterest board of her wedding all planned out, from the dress to the colour palette to the invitations. I bought this dress from @reformation years ago because it reminded me of my dream wedding dress. I still haven't worn this out but I hope I'm wearing it when I get engaged or for some other significant life event.
