【弟子规⁣】
⁣
弟子规 is based on the ancient teaching of the Chinese philosopher Confucius that emphasises the basic requisites for being a good person and guidelines for living in harmony with others.⁣

Just a few days ago, my #5yo daughter was playing with the kid masks and gave to these two little bears which she described as a pair of nurse and doctor 😂😷 (Note: She also adds an ambulance as well. She was trying hard to squeeze the kid masks for them!⁣)
⁣
She told me that her K1 teacher just shared this passage before the #circuitbreaker. ⁣
⁣
亲有疾，药先尝, 晝夜侍，不离床⁣
When parents fall ill, one tastes the medicine first (to see if it's been brewed to the proper degree). And attend day and night, not leaving the bed.⁣
