Glossy buttercream floral cupcakes. Each flower petal is hand piped. Some of you asked me how long did I take to pipe them. Let’s just say that it took me quite a while, especially when the kids were running around while I was trying to concentrate 😂😂 These beautiful flowers were piped on my signature chocolate cupcakes, made with Valrhona cocoa powder. They are moist and yummy 😋

They come in box of 4, 6 or 12 cupcakes. They make great gifts if you are looking for something edible and yet pretty.

I’ll post closeup shots of different flowers next week! Do keep a lookout for them.
