Pork Trotters Beehoon for 2 pax
.
2 cans of pork trotters (stewed with mushrooms)
Half a packet of chilli beehoon (soaked)
HK Kailan (Cut into blocks of 3 inches)
3 cloves of chopped garlic
.
Stir fry garlic until fragrant. Add in the beehoon and toss until 50% cooked on medium heat. Pour in pork trotters from the can, including the sauce. Throw in the veg (stem first if there are a lot), and add 1 small bowl of chicken stock followed by another bowl of water. Mix well and let it simmer on low heat for 3-5 minutes until cooked. Salt to taste and add a dash of sugar too. No need for corn starch as it naturally thickens up. Use a wok!
