Today is sinful eating day 🤭Swipe to see more ⬅️. I wanted to try the famous Taiwanese Devil fried chicken @devilchickensg and finally I am having it today. The chicken is a really big piece of chicken breast, deep fried to crispy on the outside and juicy inside. They have 2 flavours: original and spicy. The original is slightly sweet while spicy is just the right amount of heat👍The side order of sweet potato fritter is amazing. For our Singapore friends, you really should try it.
