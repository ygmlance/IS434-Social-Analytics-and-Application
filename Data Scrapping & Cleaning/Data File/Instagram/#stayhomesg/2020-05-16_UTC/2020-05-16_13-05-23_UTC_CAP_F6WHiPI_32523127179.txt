😋Taste: 10/10. This far exceeded our expectations!! Given that we had a) no paella pan, and b) never made paella before, it tasted enough like a paella to garner compliments from all! (Although we wouldn’t dare call it a paella at this point 😅) The rice absorbed all the flavours of chicken, saffron, and the sweet bell peppers. We even managed to achieve the socarrat, or the caramelised bottom layer which we dutifully scraped up. Definitely making this again!
