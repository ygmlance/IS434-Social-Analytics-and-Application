THANK YOU | Being an avid online shopper, I find myself receiving packages quite frequently. Usually when I'm not home, the deliveryman will whatsapp me pictures of where they placed the packages to ensure that I get my items safely. 
This CB has led to a spike in deliveries. While we are zooming away online, let us thank our delivermen/women for their hard work! Send this image to a friend you know who delivers! Let them know how much their service means to you (:
