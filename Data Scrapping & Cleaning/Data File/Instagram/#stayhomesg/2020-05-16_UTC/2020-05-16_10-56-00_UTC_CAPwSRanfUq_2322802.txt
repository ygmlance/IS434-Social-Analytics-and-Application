Where to have Okonomiyaki in Singapore during CB? @ajiyasg ðŸ˜‹

This is what I like in my Okonomiyaki  savory pancake - with toppings of prawns, cheese and crabmeat.
How I like it with my Okonomiyaki? served with garlic fried rice, potato cheese mentai, potato cheese mochi, century egg tofu and end with a refreshing yuzu ginger ale drink! .
