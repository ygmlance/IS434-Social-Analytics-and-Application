Everything in our country has been shut down.. except supermarket, banks, and other emergency buildings. the whole country is at home now for at least 14 days. With positive mind and respecting the rules, I hope we will get through this safe and healthy soon 🙏🏻 The way I try to live in this situation is, trying not to stress too much, and doing sports activities at home as much as the space allowds me to. ⠀

Today I did some booty focused exercises, and I used elastic bands, but you can do them as well if you don't own any at home. Please do something good for you body now, since we can't do anything else in this situation, except some walk in nature, far from other people.⠀
.⠀
Perform each exercise with 20 reps and repeat for 4-5 times ❤️⠀
.⠀
Stay healthy, stay safe wherever you are🙏🏻😇❤️⠀
