Ugly Pizzas Sequel

Can you bake a pizza with a BBQ Grill? Not as straight forward - but with some work around - YES we can!! We tried a thin crust recipe this time because needed something that would cook quickly so that the dough would not be undercooked when the rest of the pizza is cooked. 
This is a good and easy thin crust dough recipe. 
Method: (Makes 2 12inch pizzas)
.
üçïMix 200ml lukewarm water w 1 tsp yeast and 1 tsp olive oil. Let it sit for 5 mins.
.
üçïMix the yeast mixture with 300g bread flour. Knead for 10-15 mins. Split into 2 balls, cover with wet cloth or plastic wrap. Proof for 2-3 hours. .
üçï It should double in size. Stretch the dough to form the pizza. After adding the toppings, bake for 210 degrees for 20-30 mins.
