Yes our skin changes we age, hence we need to modify our skincare routine to adapt to our skin needs. I love to explore skincare products hence I have few different types of mask to cater to my different skin needs. 
I have hydrating mask, clay mask & exfoliating mask. Before putting on hydrating mask, you will need exfoliating mask to draw out impurities from our pores so that our skin can â€˜drinkâ€™ the nutrients from the hydrating mask. Therefore I would love to share Ellure tomtato bubble mask with you guys as it is very gentle on skin, it cleanses the pores very well & lastly it brightens up your skin immediately after 1 use! âœ¨

DM now to order to try it for yourselves! ðŸ¤—
