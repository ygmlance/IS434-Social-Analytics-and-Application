I’ve always thought the old adage, “find a job you love & you never have to work a day in your life,” was utter rubbish! 😅 I have had MANY jobs that I loved & I worked my butt off at each one!!! First as a fitness instructor (see #instastory for a #throwback 😱), then as a dancer, a singer, actress, TV presenter & now Radio DJ. Because, if it is a job you love, you want nothing more than to be amazing at it, right? ⭐️ None of it came easy but every moment was a joy - even through all of the heartache & sacrifice! 😅 But what I have also learnt is, if you find a job that gives you PURPOSE.... (or you find the purpose in your job) aaaah then that is what makes all the difference!! ⭐️ A job with PURPOSE is something you don’t just work at... you live it & breathe it with every waking moment. A job with purpose is never a dead end.. it multiplies opportunities in ways you cannot yet imagine & expands your world beyond just the 9 to 5. ⭐️ When you find purpose and meaning in your work, your definition of success transcends money & isn’t dependent on climbing the corporate ladder. ⭐️ Once you discover your purpose, you may also find that the job title you attach yourself to, starts to fade away & you no longer identify with all its trimmings. And in its place instead, a sense of service to others takes shape, one that evolves with the times & seeks meaning in the areas where you are needed. ⭐️ My collective experiences have brought me to this point & i cannot wait to launch my first cookbook @smitteninthekitchen! (The pandemic has now pushed the launch closer to Christmas, but it’s given me a chance to add MORE recipes too!) ⭐️ When you find purpose, you find passion AND compassion for others as well, which is why I’ve dedicated an e-book version of my #cookbook featuring 16 Recipes for Love to @foodfromtheheartsg, a charity that delivers groceries to low-income families. ⭐️ Please help me raise $20k for this worthy cause and receive a free sneak peek of my cookbook! Details in the #linkinbio. 💛 What drives you to pursue your dreams? Have you found your purpose? Comment below! I’d love to hear about your journey too!
