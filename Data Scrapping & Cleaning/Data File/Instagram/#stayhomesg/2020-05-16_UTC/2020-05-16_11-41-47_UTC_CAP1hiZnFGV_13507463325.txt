Homecooked Uni & Seafood Situation. 🙆🏻‍♀️
.
Recipe & Steps:
Cook japanese pearl rice. It has to be the short grain japanese rice as it goes with seafood and uni. On the other hand, heat up saucepan, put butter, then Garlic, throw in scallops and prawns together,add pepper n salt to taste, prawn cook for awhile must take up already, if not will not be crunchy and can’t retains its freshness. Then continue to sear the scallops, toss some white wine to taste also. Then take up to drain away the water as scallops always produce a lot of water after cooking. Next when the rice is ready, scoop the right amount of rice you desire, plate with scallops and prawns, then cook sunny side or overeasy egg (as long as yolk is runny, it goes well with the rice), top it on the bed of rice, and finally, help yourself with copious amount of the Uni desired and plate it nicely on top.
