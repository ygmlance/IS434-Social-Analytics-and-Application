Hard Red Spring Wheat is higher in protein than soft, unbleached white wheat flour, low in carbs, low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol free, sodium free, and rich in dietary fibre. Higher in nutritional values due to reddish coloured husk intact with the wheat berries while being milled into flour. Healthier alternative to unbleached flour. Excellent for making artisan bread, bagels, pizza dough, pretzels, crackers, pancakes, waffles, and a variety of yeasted baked goods.
