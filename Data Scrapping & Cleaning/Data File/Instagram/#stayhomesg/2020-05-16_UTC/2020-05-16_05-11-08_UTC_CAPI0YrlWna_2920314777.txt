Small Blue. 蝶之舞。
A simple happy day. I am grateful that I pause during my solo walk and be in the moment. Otherwise, I definitely miss out this little beautiful butterfly (aka small blue). . 
They are just so tiny and move so fast that you may think they are flies. Looking deeply, the tiny little wild flowers and small blue on the roadside created a magical moment - a mini nature in the urban city. . 
It took me awhile to be still and alert to capture those fleecing moments with a low end mobile phone.
