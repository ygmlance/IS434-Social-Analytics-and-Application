9 May, Dinner - Tacos! Stuffed with seared beef, mango pico de gallo, lettuce and topped with crushed peanuts and parsley. We used Vietnamese-influenced flavours for the beef marinade, which we thickened into a sauce. Since we didn't have taco shells, we had to cut up our wraps ðŸ˜‚ The scraps made a delicious snack fried up!
. 
Ft. Very extra, very unnecessary swipe of sauce with our newly found pastry brush.
