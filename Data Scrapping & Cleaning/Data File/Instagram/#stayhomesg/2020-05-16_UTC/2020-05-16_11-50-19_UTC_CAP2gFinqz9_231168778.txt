Day 40 of #stayhomesg #circuitbreakersg *
I’m knitting a new doll. It’s knitted flat so I’m not used to it. The pattern requires many colours of yarn. I don’t have yarn from the same type or weight so the doll may end up looking weird. *
Meanwhile boy-boy has ransacked my Barbie drawer and has borrowed Barbie’s crochet hat and blouse.
