And just like that, 
In a blink of an eye,
Ten years have passed,
Keep lighting up our lives
My Darling Daughter.

It was a task to cheer her up on this birthday as we couldn't go anywhere nor could we invite anyone. So we  decided to make it special at home. I baked her favourite cake and my husband ordered all her favourite "fast food". Decorated the table with everything available at home and tadaaa she was a happy child AlhumduLillah. .
