Pizza Dough | Adapted from https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/pizza-dough-recipe-1914764

Pizza making is actually really interesting and we have experimented a couple of times during this circuit breaker period. One time, out of sheer desperation as I was 1.5 cup short of 00 flour and Phoon Huat was OOS for the longest time, I added all-purpose flour. Dough ended up taking twice the time to bake and tasted more like a savoury biscuit. Total amateurs haha ðŸ˜¹

Doesnâ€™t require fancy ingredients - we used Phoon Huat instant yeast, Redman 00 flour. This recipe really worked for us evidenced by our first attempt! What Iâ€™ll add is that the dough anyway proofs in room temperature in SG climate. It took 1.5 hours to double in size.

Storage: section out dough into palm sized balls. Lightly flour the surface area before dropping them into individual ziplock bags and storing in your freezer. Takes 2 hours tops to defrost before use!

More on pizzas next time. Going to try a different flour brand in our next attempt!
