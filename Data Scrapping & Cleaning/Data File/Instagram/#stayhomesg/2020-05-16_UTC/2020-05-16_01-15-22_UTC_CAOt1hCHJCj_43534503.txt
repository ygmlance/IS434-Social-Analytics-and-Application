Sake anyone? I don’t drink sake to be honest but I am super fascinated to try out sake mask! Since I can’t drink it, I can use it right? 😆.

Have long heard that sake on skin will help in whitening and brightening and since I have more time at home now, this is the best time to try it out! Here’s my honest review for you 🤗.

I smell sake after opening the pack and the texture of the mask is moist and thick. I applied it on my bare cleansed face and leave it on for about 5 minutes. Was initially skeptical if there will be any reaction to my skin since this is the first time I apply sake on my face but yeah, no tingling sensation or pain at all 👍🏻. My face does look slightly brighter after one use 🥰.

Love the fact that it is made in Japan and if you are keen to try this out yourself, it is available via Lazada official store 😘
