Creme Brûlée 🍮
.
🍴Overall ease: 9/10
.
🛒Ingredients: just 4 ingredients - sugar, egg, heavy cream, vanilla
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: 
1. Heat cream with vanilla and cook until just hot.
2. Beat yolks & sugar together before mixing in the cream mixture.
3. Add ramekins to a dish filled with boiling water (till halfway covering the ramekins) and bake for 20-30 minutes until centers are slightly wobbly.
4. Leave it in the fridge to cool for up to 2 days and brûlée it right before serving.

Alternative methods to blow torch -
1. Add sugar to the top & use a heated metal spoon to melt it directly onto the custard (found this the easiest!)
2. Top with caramel shards which involves dissolving sugar & pouring it onto baking paper to cool (although this method requires true skill to get it thin & crisp)
3. Broiling in the oven
.
😋Taste: 8/10. Simple & classic sweet dessert that’s easy to make
