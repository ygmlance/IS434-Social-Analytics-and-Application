Breaking Circuit D40...
💘 A day of love. A day of joy...A bittersweet day. Mixed ethereal emotions. I feel alive....and kicking! Survival of the fittest 🤵🏼👰🏾. Survival of 3 cycles of itches 😂. Also, D=40...Quarantena, from the 14th–15th-centuries Venetian language, designating the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the Black Death plague epidemic 😮. It's a bizarre day. We'll just stay inside and enjoy lounging together and eat 🦀. #loungingtogether #anniversary #justthetwoofus
