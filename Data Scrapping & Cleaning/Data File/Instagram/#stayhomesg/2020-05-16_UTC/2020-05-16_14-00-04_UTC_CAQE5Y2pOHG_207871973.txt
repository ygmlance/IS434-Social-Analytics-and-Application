🍫 1-Minute Microwave Brownie 🍫
YESSSSSS. I hear y’all are requesting for more video recipes, especially baking ones so here’s a really simple brownie recipe you can make anytime you have a craving~ Best part of all, I think this is relatively beginner-friendly and kids can try it out too! You can replace the caramalized biscuits with Oreos or anything you like to create your very own personalized brownie in a cup 🥰👌🏻💕 #ShersVideoRecipes

Ps : Texture may seem a bit dry because it’s really thick! That’s why I advice adding a dash of milk or icecream to add some creaminess to it 😋
