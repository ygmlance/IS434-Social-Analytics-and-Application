The weekend is here. For many of us, before Covid, the weekend was something that we all were looking forward to. We could take a break and spend quality time with our family and loved ones. Above all, it was a time that we could go to church and be with God's people to worship the Lord together and fellowship with one another. Till the day that we can gather again, may we continue to worship the Lord on our own, remembering that He is our Shepherd.
