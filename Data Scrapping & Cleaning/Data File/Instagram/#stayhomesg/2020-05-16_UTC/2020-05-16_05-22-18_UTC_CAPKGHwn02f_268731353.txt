My #1 tip to crafting with toddlers: Today’s art, tomorrow’s materials!⠀
.⠀
We’re all about teaching the kids about reusing/ recycling and this extends to the materials we use for crafts too. ⠀
.⠀
Before any crafting begins, I’d set up a painting activity, where the kids have free reins to do patterning/ stamping/ mixing colours/ textures/ finger painting etc.⠀
.⠀
The double-sided paintings are then kept aside to be used as materials for our next craft; eg the sail of our sailboat, the ice cream of our ice cream cones. ⠀
.⠀
This makes any craft that much more homemade and truly by the kids. #stayhomesg #CircuitBreaker
