In these #stayhome times we're seeing a rise in the manifestation of difficult and challenging family situations and the sobering reality that while we can choose our friends (if at times we find them annoying, we can always choose to make adjustments or even terminate the friendship if needed), but unfortunately, we cannot choose our family members. As such, it can be a challenging and sometimes very difficult situation when family members are emotionally unhealthy and they have not sought help to address their own difficulties.

Instead, by having to live with them as members of the same family, they become a regular source of mental distress. In this article, we try to explore coping measures on how to deal with these distressing situations.
