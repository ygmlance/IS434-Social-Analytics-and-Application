Just put on a happy face ðŸ™‚

Or donâ€™t. No one can see you in your house anyway. Quarantine how you like. Personally, I like to paint on an in control face with various powders and creams until my inside self starts to match the outside put together self. Rarely do I actually feel put together. More like a flailing mess in lots of accessories. But such is life. Hold on as best you can and keep moving forward. .
