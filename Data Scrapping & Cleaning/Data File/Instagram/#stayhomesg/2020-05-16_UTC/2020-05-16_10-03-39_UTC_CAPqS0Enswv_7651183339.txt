“Thank you for building our country!” was the message delivered to migrant workers through 200 appreciation cards by children from YMCA Student Care Centres and Nanyang Primary School.⁣
⁣
The children personally designed these cards to show their appreciation and love for migrant workers, who left their homes to contribute to our nation’s growth. These cards were delivered alongside packed meals to their dormitories as part of YMCA Wok the Talk Project, which partners hawkers and taxi/private hire drivers to deliver meals and monthly grocery packs to communities in need.⁣
