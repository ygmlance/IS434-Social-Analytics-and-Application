DIY BUTTER BEER?!
Since bars aren't opened during Circuit Breaker and we aren't allowed to dine outside, this hot weather calls for something cold so I decided to recreate the Butter Beer from Harry Potter that I had in USJ! I used the [NEW] Brewerkz Golden Ale available at @CheersSG, which has a smooth, malty taste and mild floral notes to complement the creamy foam.

Steps
1️⃣ Prepare 80ml of Whipping cream, 8g of Caster sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of Vanilla extract
2️⃣ Whip it using a whisk until it forms a thickened, creamy texture
3️⃣ Place Ice cubes in glass (I used butterfly peas and rose petals to complement the floral notes and aesthetic)
4️⃣ Pour Brewerkz Golden Ale into the glass until 80% full
5️⃣ Pour the cream foam prepared in 2️⃣ onto the Brewerkz Golden Ale before serving
