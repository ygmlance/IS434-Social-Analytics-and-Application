After checking the mailbox, I realised there were a couple of errands I needed to run outside of the house. People actually do go out, huhhhh?

Anyway, the furthest the girls have been in weeks is around the block. It was rather refreshing for the both of them to sit back on our e-scooter and enjoy the breeze. They were surprisingly obedient throughout the entire outing. 
I'm so grateful for girls who are understanding, loving and simply adorable. Except when they're smelly. I don't like smelly children. 
Oh did I mention, Arielle ate a crayola and her poop became bright green?
