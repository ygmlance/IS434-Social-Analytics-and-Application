A green plant spotted at the Sungei Ulu Pandan Canal. So unique that it inspired me to pen down the thriving plant at the edge of the canal. With Collen colour pencils, I use the A'zone Corporation Cartridge exercise book to create this drawing. Have a great pleasant to exercise on paper during this Stayhome CB period. .
