Up Next - D ball

Since I took over the D Ball in early April, I have only used it as a support for my tablet when I attend my online Crossfit training.

This 40kg D Ball and 22.5kg dumbbell have been loaned generously by @crossfitmobilus at no charge so that members can still keep up with their fitness goals. Likewise, I cannot let their good intentions go to waste.

My WOD of the day is dedicated to the equipment that I had the opportunity to look after :

3 Rounds of
500m row
12 single arm Dumbbell snatches
6 D Ball over

Time to complete: 16:00 min
