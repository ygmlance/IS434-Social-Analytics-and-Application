Fats has such a bad name but I love them all the same. I find my body unable to function properly when I am lacking this macronutrient. Almonds and peanut butter are my favourite! How about you?
Featuring sneaky baked corn and almond by @tomsfarmuae, bought from @shopee_sg wheeee!

Time for more work! Hang on there, Singapore!
