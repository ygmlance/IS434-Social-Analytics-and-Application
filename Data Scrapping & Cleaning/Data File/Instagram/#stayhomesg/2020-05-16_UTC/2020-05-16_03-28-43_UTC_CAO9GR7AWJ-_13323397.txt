Ohayo !! Recreating my own { Fruit sando } at home :) #EileenAtHome
.
These may not be the most creative fruit sandwiches but the popping colors made them look good 😉
.
Using thicker brioche bread slices and greek yogurt as the spread and filler, these sandwiches are healthier than those filled with cream.
.
I would love to make one with strawberries however, I have yet to find any at the supermarkets near me( I don’t want and am too lazy to travel far for that reason). Finest had the big ones on discount and I saw mould on one of the boxes ☹️😞
.
Using what we already have in the fridge ( kiwi, kohyo grapes and mikan) and viewing 3-4 tutorials on YouTube and Ig, I managed to come up with these. Here’s a tip for you - think of the image you want when you slice it down; the placement of the fruits and direction is important :)
.
Do have fun playing around with different fruits! Sayonara for now 😋 #料理写真
