Was scrolling through my records to see how my last two months has been since starting to Work from Home! Pleasantly surprised at the record actually! I mean, in the last month, if you see my posts and those times I didn't share, I really haven't been very consistent with eating low-carb or doing IF. Only thing that was regular was drinking my ketones twice a day.

Anyway, shared that to let you know we are we are GIVING AWAY 20 days worth of free ketones, sent to you, wherever you are!

All you got to do is:
1. Follow my account
2  Like this picture

I will send you the contest details! Don't worry, there are privacy settings in place. Just DM me! ⭐⭐Contest ends at 11pm SGT, tonight, 16 May (11am ET). xx
