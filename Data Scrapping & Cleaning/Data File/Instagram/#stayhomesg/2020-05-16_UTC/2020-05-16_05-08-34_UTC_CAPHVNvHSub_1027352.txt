Thanks to @dphuacs (with the link-up from @engtingting), I received a lunch delivery from @kajikensquare2 for my family lunch. It’s probably been more than a year since I had Mazesoba, so I was looking forward to having the dry-style ramen again.
What’s the most important step to enjoying this dish is a very thorough toss. And I mean VERY THOROUGH. You should aim to spend at least 30 seconds mixing everything up (if you ordered yours with toppings, do move them to a plate first). Investing this half a minute of your day ensures the strands of #ramen are evenly coated in the onsen egg, minced meat sauce, spring onion and strips of crisp seaweed. Otherwise, you will find it clumpy and dry in parts. 
Pro Tip: You can request for the sauce to be packed separately if you want to pour it in just before mixing which I think is actually the  best thing to do. And if you like more heat and acidity in your #Mazesoba, don’t be afraid to ask for extra chilli oil and vinegar.
David also sent me something that I had never tried before - the Mazesoba with Cod Roe and Mayonnaise ($15.80). I found myself also enjoying this ramen for its lusciously creamy and very savoury-umami sauce. 
As for ramen texture, @kajikensquare2 cooks theirs al dente for a pleasing QQ chew.
You can tap on the link in their bio to order their curbside delivery. By the way, delivery for the FIRST 10 ORDERS EVERYDAY that hits $30 and above is FREE, regardless of distance. But if you live within 10km of their restaurant situated in Novena Square 2 and your order meets the minimum bill amount, you don’t have to pay for delivery.
