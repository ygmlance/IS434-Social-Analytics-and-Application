Love Hate Relationship

I hate my 22.5kg dumbbell because it makes me dread every upcoming workout, thinking how much I have to struggle with it.

I love my 22.5kg dumbbell because it makes me know I am one step closer to becoming stronger.

I love it that I had these thoughts of hate because it means I am facing what I am weakest in and dreading the most.
