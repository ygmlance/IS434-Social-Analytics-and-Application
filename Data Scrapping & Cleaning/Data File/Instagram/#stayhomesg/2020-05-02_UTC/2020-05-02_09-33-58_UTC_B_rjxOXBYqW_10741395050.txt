What goes into a fine art studio shoot? Barry Seah aka the @motorgrapher takes us behind the scenes of his photo series "Masked Bike Portraits".
.
First, he plans out the concept and sketches out the composition. Then he sets up the lighting, props and camera for a test shoot, with plenty of trial and error along the way. For these portraits, he used a medium format camera, the Fujifilm GFX50s, and the Broncolor Siros L800 studio strobe. Once all is in place, it's up to Barry to make the magic happen!
