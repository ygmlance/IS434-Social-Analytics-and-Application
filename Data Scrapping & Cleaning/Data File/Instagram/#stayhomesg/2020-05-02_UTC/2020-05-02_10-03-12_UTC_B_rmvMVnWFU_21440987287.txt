🧼Moringa Latte is a marvellous bar for all skin type. This bar contains the controversial hemp seed oil that has a cousin M from the dark side, yet is itself a wonderful #superfood for the skin. On one hand, it can be left overnight on the skin to alleviate dry skin yet on the other other hand, it can combat acne for oily skin. The bar also contains Shea Butter which like Hemp Seed oil is so moisturising yet is a 0 on the comedogenic scale meaning they do not clog pores.⁠
.⁠
And how can we forget the organic Moringa - star in the soap? There's so much benefits written about it - from firming up the skin to slowing down signs of aging, evening out skin tones, fighting acne and tightening pores...also suitable for all skin types.⁠
.⁠
This bar also contains kaolin clay which is one of the gentlest of all clay. It is often used to purify skin pores, alleviate skin irritations.
.⁠
But as we always stress, we love all the wonderful benefits of these ingredients but the sure thing you should count on for a bar of all-natural CP soap is that it cleanses without any nasties and yet naturally moisturises with the glycerin, nourishing oil or additives it contains.
