While dad and mom were having a nap, the girls were playing chess and elder brother was watching TV, the puppy decided to snitch some snacks. David loves this puzzle house from #glÃ¼ckskÃ¤fer, and pulls it out regularly. The piecesâ€™ free form allows the imagination to take over. A rocker, a kennel, a table, a crib. 
Yesterday David picked up a sprouted durian seed and said bird! And indeed it did look like one - just a reminder that when we look at things without thinking we know what they are, we see all their possibilities ðŸ’• #stayhomestaypositive
