Meltingly tender wagyu beef + rich and creamy mentaiko sauce = heavenly 🤤 While contemplating what to order for my dad’s birthday dinner today, I wanted something foolproof and I’m so glad I chose @waacowsg 💯 My whole fam enjoyed their wagyu beef bowls loads 😍 They’re doing islandwide delivery if you don’t already know - you know who to order from the next time you need a lil’ indulgence 😉 Thanks @waacowsg for always exceeding expectations ✨
