Pairing 2008 La Collina dei Ciliegi Amarone Riserva with clay pot rice and  braised pork with cantonese stir-fried bitter gourd.

The  art  of  serving  the  right  bottle  of  wine  with  a  specific  food  has  become  one  of  the most  overly  legislated  areas,  all  to  the  detriment  of  the  enjoyment  of  both  wine  and  food. 
Learning  to  enjoy  wine  and  food  is  an  acquired  taste  and  skill  for  which  everyone, regardless  of  level  of  perceived  sophistication,  is  entitled  to his or  her opinion!
