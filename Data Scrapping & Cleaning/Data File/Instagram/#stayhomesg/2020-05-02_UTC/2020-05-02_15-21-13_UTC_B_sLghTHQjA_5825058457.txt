My mother-in-law has been cooking everyday since the #circuitbreaker started. We tried not to go out especially we have old and young ones in the house. ⁣
⁣
Besides eating more healthy, my mother-in-law is taking spirulina with her oats. Sometimes she just mix with water and chilled it. She told me it's so shiok and refreshing the next day she drink it. ⁣
⁣
Spirulina is one of the most nutrient-dense, plant-based sources of protein on the planet. ⁣

74% of SimpliiGood Spirulina is made of raw protein that delivers 18 of the 20 amino acids needed for almost every function of the body. Calorie for calorie, it contains 3x more Protein than meat. And it's entirely plant-based.⁣
