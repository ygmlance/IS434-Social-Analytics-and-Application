Our May-June issue of Time Out Singapore was due to come out this month but due to the circuit breaker, we can’t bring you our usual print magazine. Instead, we’ve made our first-ever digital pocket mag filled with ideas on how you can best spend Time In. Click the link in our bio and have a flip – the images link out to more stories you can read online on timeout.com/Singapore. We hope you enjoy it and we’ll be back with our regular print copy in June.
