DAY 26 #stayhomecooking 
I love the texture and the crunch of root vegetables.  Sadly cant find any burdock since our #stayhome period.  So its just lotus roots on my plate today. .
 Lotus root is as its name implies the root of the lotus flower. It is cooked in various ways and in Chinese cooking more commonly in soups. .
I had previously made fried lotus root balls by grating them with other ingredients - they tasted like takoyaki (squid balls).

It is known to have many health benefits and helps boost the immune system. Energetically, they help to 'ground' us.. *** LOTUS ROOTS & CARROTS KINPIRA.
Kinpira is a Japanese cooking style of "saut√© and simmer". It is commonly used to cook root vegetables such as carrot, burdock and lotus root and is a Japanese classic side dish. .
*** Just saute veggies in sesame oil, stirring constantly.  Add mirin, tamari and a little water. Simmer for 10-15 mins and sprinkle  with toasted sesame seeds.

*** AGEDASHI TOFU
Another homestyle class in Japanese cuisine. Its cheap and easy to prepare. *** Press the firm tofu to drain excess water to prevent spluttering.  Gently dust the  tofu cubes with either tapioca or potato starch flour, or any choice flour you have.
 Pan fry till lightly  crispy. Usually served with bonito flakes, scallions, grated daikon, grated ginger.
