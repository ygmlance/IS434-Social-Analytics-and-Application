Breaking Circuit D26...
ðŸŽ¶So tonight I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nineðŸŽ¶. Crans Montana. House with a view. Hmm yeah right. NOT! Just sky on a flat surface. Nag, nag, nutter. Park on the street. And going down to our appartment. Going inside...to the bedroom...to THAT balcony, THAT sunset...oh, oops...Mt. BlancðŸ¤“. Playing tennis with swiss chard leaves. Roasting arms with the caille, ouch! First BIG wine tasting fair with funicular transportation back to THE view... #memories #travelmemories #balcony #sunset #SGUnited #staysafe #singaporecircuitbreakerÂ  #stayhomeÂ  #things2doinsingapore #stayhomesg #somethingspecial #doaslittleaspossible #googleismyfriend
