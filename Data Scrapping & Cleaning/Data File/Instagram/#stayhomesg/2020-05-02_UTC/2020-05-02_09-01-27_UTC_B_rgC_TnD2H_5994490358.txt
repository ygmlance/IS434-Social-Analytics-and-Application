On your screens tonight at 9pm, the first pre-recorded livestream episode of #TakeBackTheNights debuts on our Facebook page! Look out for circuit longtimers Jack and Rai, young bloods FingerFunk and host, Audrey Lim who has a chat with David Siow, president of SG MUSO a key partner of this project.

It’s free to stream, and you’re also free to scan the QR code on screen (linked to #SGMUSO a registered charity) to add to the kitty to get all musicians and tech crew on this project paid!
