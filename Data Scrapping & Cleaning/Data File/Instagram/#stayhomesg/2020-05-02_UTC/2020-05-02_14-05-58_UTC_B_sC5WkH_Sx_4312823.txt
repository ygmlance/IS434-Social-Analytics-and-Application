Soft bun, crunchy crust but not satisfied, yet.

Also tried a new tangzhong recipe for the rolls and did not enjoy it.

Not all the kitchen adventures will be successful and that is okay. Not a wasted attempt as long as I learn something out of it right? 💡

Very randomly.. Today had been really tough emotionally. 🚶🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🚶🏻‍♀️🙁☹️😥 .
