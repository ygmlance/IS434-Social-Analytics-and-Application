@blueskiescottonclouds, a long-time foodie friend of mine, blessed me this evening with her homecooked Nasi Lemak and it was superb! I am equal parts amazed and grateful for the effort sheâ€™s put in to ensure itâ€™s as perfect as possible. Can you believe she took the feedback from our mutual foodie friends @uncle_lim_chiak @singaporeliciouz and Head Chef @mano.thevar of @thevar.sg, who had eaten their share of it earlier for lunch, seriously enough to tweak her Beef Rendang? I count myself lucky because I got to taste her best rendition of it for dinner, thanks to them. It went extremely well with the uber fragrant rice she had cooked too. I must say though, my absolute favourite was the Sambal she made from scratch - itâ€™s so appetising Iâ€˜d have been thrilled to simply pair that with the rice. She even took the trouble to fry the ikan bilis till very, very crispy which is such an important step. The immensity in which I enjoyed this Nasi Lemak is immeasurable. Thank you once again for this awesome, awesome treat @blueskiescottonclouds ðŸ¤—ðŸ’•ðŸ¤—ðŸ’•. #veronicaphuaeats #homecooked #nasilemak #beefrendang #sambal #burpproved #burpple #burpplesg #singaporefood #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #igfood #igfoodie #tastespotting #forkyeah #foodiesofinstagram #foodlover #foodstagram #foodie #instaeat #foodspotting #foodporn #foodinstagram #singapore #stayhomesg #homecookedfood
