A new cat has joined the knitted gang. It’s Boy-boy’s mom!
...
This was meant to be a test of a new (to me) technique of “knitting legs 2 at a time” which I learnt off YouTube. I kept mixing up the yarn so I used 2 different colour yarn. After watching the video hundreds of time, I finally understood. And after that I kept going until I ran out of the maroon yarn. Say hello to Mrs Ngeow. Friends call her Ngeow Bu.
...
I wanted to knit the arms onto the body directly but it was too hard so I had to knit the arms separately and sew them on. One of the arms is a bit crooked so might have to perform surgery.
...
But check out the ears. I knitted them directly on the head. I’m so thrilled with the result.
