Pork chop for lunch, marinated with fresh rosemary from our humble garden and grilled vegetables following the recipe by @anastasiiavorger was a hit and goes very well with the pork chop! Thank you! Since we had to use plenty of lemons for the oysters and grilled vegetable, decided to zest the lemon to use for my homemade vodka apple a√ßai #stayhomesg #covidcircuitbreakersg #sg20memories
