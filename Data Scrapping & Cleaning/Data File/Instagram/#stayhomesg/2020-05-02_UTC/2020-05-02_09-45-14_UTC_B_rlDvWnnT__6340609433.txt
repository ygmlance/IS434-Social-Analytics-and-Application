#CircuitBreaker Day26⠀
⠀
Recently, we were shopping for great deals online and decided that we should maybe order some cookies!  We are so glad that we discovered these cookies 🍪! These cookies were of bite sizes with chocolate lava in it, and it’s individually packed (10g each). It’s rather addictive once you start on it and we couldn’t resist popping them one after another right into our mouth! Also there’s ❌ Trans Fat in these biscuits! ⠀
