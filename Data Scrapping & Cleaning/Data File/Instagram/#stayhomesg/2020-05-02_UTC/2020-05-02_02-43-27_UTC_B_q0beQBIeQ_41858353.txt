‚Å£‚Å£I don't really think you can call this a recipe but ginger-scallion sauce is one of my favourite things of all time. I always saw it as the condiment you get when you eat Cantonese style roast meats, but it's so much more versatile than that- spoon it onto seafood or meats, toss into noodles like I did, have it on rice, stir fry it with vegetables, spread it on toast? Honestly anything would work, and it stores well so you can just make a big batch and keep it in the fridge ‚†Ä‚†Ä

It's just simply‚†Ä‚†Ä
3 parts of the green portion of spring onion finely sliced‚†Ä‚†Ä
1 part of grated ginger‚†Ä‚†Ä
Pour in smoking hot oil(I use just enough to cover but the traditional recipes use far more oil)‚†Ä‚†Ä
‚†Ä
‚†Ä
I then season with salt, pepper, and sesame oil when it's cooled. If I'm eating it with noodles I always hit it with some rice vinegar and soy sauce. Finish it with a crispy fried egg and you have a quick meal in 5 mins. Super easy üòå
