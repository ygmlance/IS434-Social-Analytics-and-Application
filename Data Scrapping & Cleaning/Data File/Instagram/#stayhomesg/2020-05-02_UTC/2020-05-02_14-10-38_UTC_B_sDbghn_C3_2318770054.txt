So what will you be cooking these few days to come? A simple yet filling meal that my dad cooked for the family was none other than the inspired "Din Tai Fung Style" fried rice 🤗
❗️Simply stir fry the rice with egg, salt, olive oil, soya sauce, grey prawn and topped with spring onion, and you're done! 😋🍽
