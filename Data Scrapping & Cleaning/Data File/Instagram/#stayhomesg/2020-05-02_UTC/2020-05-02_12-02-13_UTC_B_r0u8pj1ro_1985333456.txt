Compared to other types of materials, brass doorknobs disinfect themselves in about 8 hours due to metal ions in brass and copper which are toxic to mold, viruses, and other living microorganisms.

If you want to get rid of even more germs and viruses, you can opt for an UltraCare disinfection service for your home! Get it done during Circuit Breaker.
