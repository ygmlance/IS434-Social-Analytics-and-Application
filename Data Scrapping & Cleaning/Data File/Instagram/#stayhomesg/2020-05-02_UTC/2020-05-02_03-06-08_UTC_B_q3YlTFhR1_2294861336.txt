Do practise social distancing in lifts and trains 🚇 to reduce the chances of the COVID-19 spreading 😘 .
I suggested a public shower facility 💧which can be made out of a 20-ft container which allows people to refresh themselves before they hop onto their next destination. I named this shower facility as "RAINFALL::" 💧💧.
Maybe $2 for a 15min use, the same amount for a cup of orange juice 🍊? 😉
