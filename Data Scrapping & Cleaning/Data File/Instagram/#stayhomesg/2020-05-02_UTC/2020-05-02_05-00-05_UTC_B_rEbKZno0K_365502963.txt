One Pot 15 Minutes Hainanese Chicken Rice?? üò±
(Swipe all the way to the last to see video)
First time making Chicken Rice using the Ninja Foodi and damn it was amazingly quick and simple to do.
So basically what I did was to stir fry some ginger and lemongrass with oil and butter till fragrant using the Ninja Foodi Cooker. Then I add some rice and chicken stock. Place a wire rack on the top of the rice and add my marinated chicken. High pressure for 3 mintues, the change to grill mode for 10 minutes. It's so fast! I literally cooked an entire meal in until 15 mintues for my whole family! The fact that I get to cook my rice while at the same time roast my chicken in the same pot is truly amazing. At first, I was skeptical about the multi cooker when they wanted to send me one to try it out. But, boy I was wrong! Can't wait to explore more dishes with this baby. üòé
