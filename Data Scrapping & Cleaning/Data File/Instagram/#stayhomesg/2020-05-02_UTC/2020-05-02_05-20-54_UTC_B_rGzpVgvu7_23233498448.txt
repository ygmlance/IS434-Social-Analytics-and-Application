Last night's quick bake. Keto egg loaf. Turned out pretty well I thought - pretty bouncy and moist! Love how easy it was - just needed to blitz all the ingredients together and in to the oven! Can't wait to plan fry it with butter to make it into French toast!oh, and I like that this uses coconut flour instead of nut flour. Thanks @keto.mammas.kitchen for sharing the recipe as the original post from another owner had removed it. ❤️
