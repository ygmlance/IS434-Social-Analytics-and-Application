😋Taste: 9/10. Our idea of Greek comfort food! Thankfully nailed the timing such that the fish was firm but tender. The sauce was sweet and sour - effectively a zinged up version of canned sardines! - but with an additional hint of creaminess from the hummus and freshness from the lettuce bed. Super easy, nutritious, and a recipe useful to have in your back pocket!
