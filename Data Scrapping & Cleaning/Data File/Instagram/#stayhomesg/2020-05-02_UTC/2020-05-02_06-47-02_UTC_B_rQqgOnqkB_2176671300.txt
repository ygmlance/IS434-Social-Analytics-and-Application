A perfect day for yummilicious curry rice

Mixed Organic Brown Rice with Organic Wild Red & Black Rice for a more wholesome nutrient profile. We have these three types of rice grains conveniently mixed for you 😊
You may also add in Organic Quinoa, Flaxseeds, Barley, Beans for extra texture. It is definitely a healthier choice than polished white rice 🍚.
