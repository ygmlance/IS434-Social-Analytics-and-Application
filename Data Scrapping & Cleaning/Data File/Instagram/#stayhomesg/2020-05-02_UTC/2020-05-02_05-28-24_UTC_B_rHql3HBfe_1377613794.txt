02.05.2020 @0749hrs - The taxis.

Taxis in queue but hardly any passengers at the Geylang Serai Wet Market taxi stand.

Entry to this popular market is now by the last digit of your identity card. Odd/even digits for odd/even dates respectively. 
Part of Changi Road decked with the Hari Raya festive decorations but incomplete due to Covid-19. There is a hugh greeting structure on the grass verge just before the wet market. Doubt it all be displayed proper before time. 
Stay healthy!
