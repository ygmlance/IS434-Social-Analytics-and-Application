It’s World Herb Day! 🤗⁣⁣
⁣⁣
From growing herbs in the garden to using them in food, medicine and crafts, herbs play a huge role in the world. They are essential in many of our cooking routines! Without them, our creations will be less flavoursome and less aromatic! ☝🏻⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Some of the most recognisable herbs have scents like no other such as Lavender; well known for its smell and commonly used in perfumed beauty products. On top of that, Lavender also helps aid sleeping! ⁣⁣
