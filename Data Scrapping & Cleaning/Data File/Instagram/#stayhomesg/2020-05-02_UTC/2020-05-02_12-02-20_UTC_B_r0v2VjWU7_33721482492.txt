It is easy to overlook the backs that break and the hands that built our glistening city. Singapore is built on the courage of migrants who put their lives on pause to call our island - ‘home’. They toil tirelessly to do the jobs that our locals would not and face more than just lonesomeness in this alien town
.

COVID 2019 has put many of our lives on hold. But it has also given us the space to reflect. It exposes the luxuries or there-lack-of in our ways of living. If a society is as good as its weakest links, then Singapore has much work to do
.

In view of the affected migrants during this season, 20% of the profits from this order will be put towards a migrant worker charity
