First day not rounding / post call in 2 weeks so decided to cook again. 😅 Laksa for lunch and this decadent dish - spinach and 3 types of egg (century egg, salted egg and egg) for dinner. Really adoreee this Chinese dish and always ordering it at ALL the Chinese restaurants! Decided to make it myself bc it’s actually super straightforward ! ☺️ #circuitbreaker #stayhomesg #domesticcrashcourse
