Enjoyed a simple breakfast with the treat I received from @ellaziqsingapore which provides high quality halal products. Thank you!

Crispy sambal cookies was a collaboration between #Ellaziq and @hipsterbakes. Made with Heng’s Crispy Prawn Chilli, the cookies are buttery and savoury with hints of spiciness and crispiness! Ho jiak! 😋

Made a toast with #ElDina chicken floss. Simply toast the bread, top with mayo and chicken floss. Simple and delicious! Available in original and seaweed flavours. 😍

You can find #EllaziqSg store at @shopee_sg. From now till 30 June 2020, quote “ELLA10OFF” for 10% off with min $10 spend across any items from the store.

Wishing all my muslim readers a blessed Ramadan! 😊
