Hopped on the bandwagon a lil late but thanks to #circuitbreaker & being on leave from work, still managed to cross out this task from the to do list. Hereâ€™s my pic of dalgona coffee after 5 failed attempts (2 from milo + 3 from coffee). Failed attempts due to lack of whipped cream & powdered creamer for my milo dalgona. Gave up and switched to making coffee dalgona instead for ðŸ‘« but used the wrong coffee powder. Still, managed to complete and mix my way out of it hehe ðŸ˜‰ #dalgona #coffee #stayhomesg #fotd #food #blog #jigglyjiggscooks
