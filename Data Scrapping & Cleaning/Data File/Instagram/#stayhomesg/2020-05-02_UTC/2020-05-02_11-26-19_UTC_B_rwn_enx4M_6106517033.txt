Admiring this Saturdayâ€™s sunset in Katong, feeling like we can breathe a little easier today given the announcement that certain #covid19 measures will loosen in a few days. Numbers in the community are slowly going down and we are so thankful for our wonderful country ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ and government for all theyâ€™ve done in light of this #pandemic. Thereâ€™s still a long way to go, but all in all, we are safe, we are happy, we are healthy, life is good.
