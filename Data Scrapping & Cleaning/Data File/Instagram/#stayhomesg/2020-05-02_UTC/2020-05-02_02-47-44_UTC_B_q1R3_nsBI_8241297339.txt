It's been raining this past week and this cooler weather gets me into a baking mood. Baked bread using the tangzhong method. Some find this step a hassle which is surprising considering that it is fast to make in the microwave or over the stove and the resulting bread stays soft longer.  Whether itâ€™s with higher hydration or with the Yudane or tangzhong method, we love soft bread. In this version, I tweaked the recipe using orange juice and zest. Added OJ to the milk and left it to curdle in the acidity into buttermilk. This batch came out fluffier and bigger. For one of the loaves, I added nutella for the hazelnut chocolaty hit. Too bad I didn't have hazelnut on hand otherwise that would have added a nice crunch. Baking ingredients are just a bit harder to find during this period. #whattobakenext #stayhomestaysafe
