🌊 WRIST-FRIENDLY CORE 🌊⠀
Wrist pain is actuallt pretty common and can be due to a variety of reasons. I recall the last time I experienced it was tendonitis from carrying my son at a bad angle.. it got so bad that I couldn't even carry a mug and had to get steroid jabs 😥 if you have wrist pain for whatever reason, here are some ways you can modify your core workouts 😊⠀

I get really bored just holding still in a forearm plank for like 5 minutes 😴, and I prefer to incorporate dynamic core exercises to challenge my core in a shorter time. Can anyone relate? 🤣⠀
