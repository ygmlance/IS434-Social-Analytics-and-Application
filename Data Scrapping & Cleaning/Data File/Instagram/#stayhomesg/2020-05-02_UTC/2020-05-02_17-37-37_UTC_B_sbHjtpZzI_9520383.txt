Tried one stall near the neighborhood which usually we do not have much time to visit. Apparently they have quite good biz as delivery men keep coming in to pick up their orders. 
The pork ribs is my favorite. 
Fish is a bit overdone. Meat on the tough side. 
And guess what I saw in cedele along that stretch big shop houses? 
Cakes. Whole cakes.😍😍😍😍 I was just thinking I would probably have no birthday cake 🎂 this year. Eyes nearly pop out. That's two days back before they announced today that cakes will be available from 12 may onwards.
