2/31 - Fine, Thank You...
Prompt: Put yourself in a moment where you were not fine.
Reaction: In modern society, weakness is something not easily displayed or accepted. For fear of retaliation or criticism, it is easy to cover it up with a "fine, thank you". But what i find worrying is, for how long are we gona cover it up. And in the worrying thought of taking comfort in hiding my weaknesses.

#circuitbreakermay, i've decided to take on an experiment in abstract imagery using the prompts from #theisolationjournals , to inspire me from their writing. During the #ecbm (extended circuit breaker measures) that will be in place in #singapore for the month of may.
