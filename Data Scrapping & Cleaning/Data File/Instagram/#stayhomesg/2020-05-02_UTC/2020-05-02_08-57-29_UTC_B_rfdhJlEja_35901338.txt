We bought this fun ping-pong toy from @shopee_sg which only costs $10.61. We used our Shopee coins so it only cost $7.72 for us! 
Mae can play it by herself, giving her some good exercise at home. We can also join in anytime—fun for everyone! ❤️

The toy is safe too. When the ball on the wire rebounds and touches Mae at times, she doesn’t find it painful at all. 
Love it that we don’t need to go and chase after a runaway ball—whoever thought of this is a genius! 
I’ll be able to do something else while Mae is playing with the toy. 👍
