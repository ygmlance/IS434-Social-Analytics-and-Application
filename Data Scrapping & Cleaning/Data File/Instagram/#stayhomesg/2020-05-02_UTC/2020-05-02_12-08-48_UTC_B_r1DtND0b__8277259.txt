Was talking to @natalieandville late last night and I don‚Äôt how we started the conversation about bread, pizza and Bubble Tea. Lol yes our conversations mostly revolve around food we miss. Her telling me how easy it is to make pizza dough got me craving for pizzas from our favourite restaurant in Barcelona, Parking Pizza. Those chewy soft ones üòã yums.

I used to buy pre-made pizza dough and I didn‚Äôt realize how easy it was to make from scratch! Of course it‚Äôs still not as great as the ones we love from Barcelona but this comes close enough. ‚Å£

Ps. Thin crust pizza or pan pizza? Do you eat your crust first or leave the crust?
I made my crust extra thick üòâ. ‚Å£
