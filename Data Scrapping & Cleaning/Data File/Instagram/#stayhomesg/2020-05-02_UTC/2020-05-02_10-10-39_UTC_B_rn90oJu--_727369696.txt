⚡HOW TO DO AB CRUNCHES ON A BALANCE BALL FOR 40 PERCENT BETTER RESULTS⚡

Do you believe that you can get more abdominal traction on the stability ball than on the floor?

Research shows that you can!

A Kinesiology study shows that crunches performed on a stability ball boosted activation, or flexing, of abdominal muscles by 24 to 38 percent over crunches done without a ball.

It is important to get one that is according to your height. For example, if you are between 150 and 165 cm, get a 55cm ball. Swipe left to see the ball size chart from @sanctband_singapore

Look at the way I move my upper body in an engaged and restricted motion. This is to engage smaller core muscles that help keep your balance on the ball.

You'll sculpt all the muscle groups in the abdominals; particularly the transverses for a flat stomach which are sometimes missed in regular sit-ups, as well as the obliques for a whittled-down, small waist, and the outermost muscle, the rectus.

I honestly detest traditional sit-ups and crunches with a vengeance unless they are done correctly which many people do not. Even if they were done correctly, the repeated force of crunches can cause the discs in your back to bulge (the gel nucleus of the disc bulges), pressing on nerves causing lower-back pain and potentially causing herniated disc.
