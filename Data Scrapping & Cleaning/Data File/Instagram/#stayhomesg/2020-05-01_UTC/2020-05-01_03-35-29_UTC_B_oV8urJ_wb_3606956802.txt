Awesome 90 mins practice today ! A big “Thank you!” to everyone who joined today as well as to everyone who has been practicing with me for this one month. I have heard so much positive feedback about improvement from daily practice. Classes are still ongoing as we enter into the 2nd month of our “circuit breaker”. DM me for details! #yoga #yogapractice #yogaeverydamnday #cats #catsofinstagram #catlife #stayhome #stayhomesg
