”这是我孙子。最小的。很顽皮啊。带他出来，很麻烦。他只喜欢，MacDoner”⁣
⁣
How about “Tomorrow going, you know?” ⁣
⁣
Familiar? You must be of a certain vintage. ⁣
Although McDonald’s was not a prominent feature of my childhood, there is no running away from these endearing adverts from the fast food giant. ⁣
⁣
Yes, Covid-19 took out this fast food giant for 2 weeks (and potentially longer) in Singapore, and has and threatens to take out many more other establishments permanently. ⁣
⁣
The morning of the announcement, there was a flurry of messages, including some by friends who managed to nail one final McDelivery before the closure. ⁣
⁣
I probably eat @mcdsg only once or twice a month. It’s usually for the special menu like nasi lemak burger, or the sundaes. My favorite regular menu items are the sausage McMuffin and nuggets. Anyone here eats your fries by scooping up a dollop of vanilla ice cream (it’s a perfect combination IMHO)? And yes I confess, I buy the Happy Meals for the toys sometimes. ⁣
⁣
When they announced they’d be closed for 2 weeks, it felt like an old friend falling sick. ⁣
⁣
So, I attempted to reproduce my favorites. McMuffin and McNuggets. I also attempted a curry dip using Japanese curry bricks. Forgot to capture a pic of that, but it really was quite nice. ⁣
