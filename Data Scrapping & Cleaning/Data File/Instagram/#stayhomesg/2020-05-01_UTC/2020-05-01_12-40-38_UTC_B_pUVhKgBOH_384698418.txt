Celebrate the start of the school holidays and May the 4th by participating in little challenges we're organizing.

The 1st competition:
DRESS UP as your favourite StarWars character!

Three most creative entries will stand a chance to win awesome StarWars Tsum Tsum Totebags courtesy of our friends from Reed & Singapore Comic Con - SGCC!

How to participate?
Simply use household items & recycled materials or your own home made costume and dress up like a favourite character.

Submit your entries in the comments on our facebook post with a caption detailing who your character is before the 9th of May.

More rules & regulations are on the images.

Good luck! Stay home, stay safe and May the Force be with you!
