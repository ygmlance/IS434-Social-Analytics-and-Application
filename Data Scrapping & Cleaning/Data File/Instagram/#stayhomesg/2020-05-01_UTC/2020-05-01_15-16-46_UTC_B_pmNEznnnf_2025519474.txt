Tried the shampoo and conditioner for a week. After shampooing, my scalp feels clean but my hair feels dry. So, I need to use the conditioner. 
After using both shampoo and conditioner, I notice my hair become smoother and my scalp feels clean and fresh. My hair ends still dry so I think I need to use the serum as a last step treatment for my hair. 
Also, the nice fragrance of the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair smells great!
