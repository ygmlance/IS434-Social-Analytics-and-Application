Another light plant-based lunch for the family today! 
A different take on sabich, an Israeli sandwich - I served it as an open-faced sandwich of fried eggplant, Israeli salad and soft-boiled eggs, bound together by a creamy tahini sauce on a light and fluffy pita. Topped with dollops of spicy zhoug. 
This recipe was adapted from @ottolenghi, whose recipes truly never disappoint - really a perfect balance of flavours and textures
