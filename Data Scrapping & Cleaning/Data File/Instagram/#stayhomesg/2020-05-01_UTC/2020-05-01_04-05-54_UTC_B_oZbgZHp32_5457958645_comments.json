And I would also eagerly wait for the popping sound when the latch was released so that I could \"catch\" the bread slice popping up from the slot. It was pure joy for a simple kid like me.

She never once complained and stayed strong throughout because she just want to give us the best she could & seeing us grow up healthy & happily. \ud83d\udc93 Despite we were not rich, but I was never once felt lack. My mum will save every single bit of goodness to us and provides us with everything as much as she can.\nNow that she's old, we all are grown up and have stable job, I want to show her appreciation and gratitude every day possible. Without her unconditional love and care, we wouldn\u2019t be who we are today!! She is also my Best Friend who listen to my problem & share my worries & happiness.

She was the pillar of strength and source of income for the whole family. She never once complained or falter. She supported my sis and I who were then, still studying while taking care of my dad who was frail and weak. Despite having to juggle both work and house chores, she had never once complained, and stayed strong throughout. Whenever my dad felt like giving up, she\u2019d be the one, reading all sorts of books, trying her very best to find means to cure his illness. She\u2019d cook him nutritious meals and make fresh fruit juice everyday even though she was already so exhausted from work. And every night she will spend time to check my homework and ask my progress because she know I am not doing well in school.

My favourite childhood memory was during my secondary school days, when I am always studying late at night till 2-3am, she will \u201cscold\u201d me for studying till the wee hours. No matter is it primary school, secondary school, junior college or when choosing university courses, she always make sure she\u2019s there to \u201cnag\u201d at me and \u201cchallenge\u201d my choices. Now that I\u2019m married, she\u2019s still there to \u201ccomplain\u201d about the food i cook and how i manage household matters. \nBut i know deep down in her heart, she love me for who I am. She\u2019s my lifelong mentor. No matter what time it is or how busy she is, I can count on her to be there for me. I\u2019m very fortunate that I can always turn to her and there was never a time where I felt that I'm alone. I'm grateful for her and I appreciate the role she play in my life \u2764\ufe0f she show me her capacity of loving someone in a way I never would have imagined, she show me how big her heart would get, she show me that being a mum is the best job in the world and she wouldn't want it any other way \u2764\ufe0f My mum is the best, she\u2019s my biggest supporter and always have my best interest at heart! \nLiked and shared to story!!!

I was really happy to have all the happy and enjoyable time playing with you, now that you are old, slow and frail, but I'm very glad that you are a happy and healthy granny and I hope you will live a long and happy life with me till a ripe old age. \n@wlh725\n@martimchan455\n@agent_andrew1388",

Happiest time when we could spend time together and I wish not only my childhood memory but till now we often had a short escape \ud83d\ude42\n\nHope to win this for my Mummy! \nI would like to thank my lovely mother for all the sacrifices she has made from the time I was born, until now. Thank you for your unconditional love for me through these years. Perhaps it is easier for me to take my frustrations out on you than anyone else in this world because you love me limitlessly and unconditionally. There were times when I was a total brat to you; I was rude, selfish and unkind. Still, you loved me anyway, and for that, I am forever grateful. You are my best friend and you always have been. I\u2019ve seen your love when you attended all my sporting events, constantly telling me how proud you are of me, and when you comforted me at times that life became a little too tough to handle. Not to mention, you have shown me how to love others and how to love them well. I will always love you forever! \u2764\n\nLiked and Shared!!
