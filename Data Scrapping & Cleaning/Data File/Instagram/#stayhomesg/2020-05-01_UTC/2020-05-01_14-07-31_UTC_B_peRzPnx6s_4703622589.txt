Netflix? Xbox, PS or Nintendo Switch? Increased screen time during this pandemic? How are your children passing their time during this pandemic? Unfortunately or fortunately for my 8 year old, outside of home based learning, screen time is still limited to 30mins a day. While Daddy works from home, itâ€™s playdate with mommy. Once the kids are asleep, my workday starts. #workathomemom #workathomelife #workathome #daytraderlife #mommylife #playdate #boardgames #boardgamesarefun #limitedscreentime #stayathome #stayathomeforsg #sgunited #staysafe #stayhome #stayhomesg #familybondingtime #familybonding #stayhomemommy #stayhomemomlife #funwiththechildren #covid19 #survivingcovid19 #stayhomemomsg #cardgames #cardgamesarefun #cardgamesarecool #kidsentertainment
