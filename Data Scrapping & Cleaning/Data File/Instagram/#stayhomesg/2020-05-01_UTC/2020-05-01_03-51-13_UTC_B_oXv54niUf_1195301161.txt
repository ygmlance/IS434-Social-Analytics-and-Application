Nothing quite feels the same as the crunch of twigs and squelch of moist dirt under your feet, right? This is one of the wooden cutlery sets I use on rotation — birchwood chopsticks and spoon, in a pouch made from batik print offcuts. We use offcuts in order to make use of otherwise scrap material. The seamstresses that we work with earn a decent wage or second stream of income from this work 🙏🏽 For this reason, we do not choose the colour or design of the fabric, and leave it all up to chance! 🤩 It’s chance that connects us all. When you think about it, we aren’t that far apart from each other at all! Who made the things you’re using today? .
