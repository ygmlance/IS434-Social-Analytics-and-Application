A very big THANK-YOU is not enough for all those labouring on extra hard these past few months! :")
. ðŸŒˆ
Battling Covid-19 day in and day out, suffering from a massive breakout due to poor living conditions, delivering food and drinks to our homes rain or shine, planning out all the HBL lessons and becoming part-time phone operators and IT experts, stocking up and handling hoarders and crowded supermarkets and taking extra precautions by helping to wipe down all surfaces for our safety... THANK YOU SOOO MUCH! :") Happy Labour Day to one and all!
