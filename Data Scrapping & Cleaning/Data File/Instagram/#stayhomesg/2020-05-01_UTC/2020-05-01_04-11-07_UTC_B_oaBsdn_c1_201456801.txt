Persevering isn't enough,  you need to really believe that you can do it. I struggled a little with this painting, so much so that I had to throw away my first draft because i just couldn't get it right. I started to doubt if I could really do it. A part of me thought maybe I should just paint something easier. I persevered and things only started to get better when I believed in myself.
