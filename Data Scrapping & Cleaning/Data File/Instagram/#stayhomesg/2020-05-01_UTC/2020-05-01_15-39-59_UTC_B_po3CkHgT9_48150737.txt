Made some waffles 🧇 for tea break! While doing so, dry ice to keep them entertained since I have a surprise delivery ( @swensenssingapore earthquakes )from my amazing manager @tjraudrey. 
Today weather is great for relaxing and hence the we catch a movie 🎥 tgt as a family! Since there is Ice cream and popcorn 🍿 we sat down and watch minions! 
The kid really enjoy it. #paigetan even say, just like cinema right? 😂
What is next for tmr’s activity? 🤔
