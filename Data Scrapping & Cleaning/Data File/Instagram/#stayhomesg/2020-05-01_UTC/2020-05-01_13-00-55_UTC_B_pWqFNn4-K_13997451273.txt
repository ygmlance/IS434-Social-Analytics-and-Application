Wishing a very happy labour day to all diligent workers out there!

We would also like to take this opportunity to thank the workers that have worked hard to provide for their families and, also, in building this nation.

Labour day marks not only the triumph of the workers spirit but also reminds us of human dignity. No matter what someone does for his/her living, he/she should be respected, as we all should be respectful to each other too. “Not by birth is one a Brahmin, not by birth is one an outcast; by deeds is one a Brahmin, by deeds is one an outcast”
