If you have a dream, take the leap of faith and use this #SGCircuitBreaker time to build out the foundations! 💪⁣
⁣
This #CBLife is rewarding you with TIME to take a couple steps back and a couple more deep breaths to focus on areas of your work / business / life that aren't and are working. 🤔⁣
⁣
When you really get down to it, you begin to see that every minute you have counts SO MUCH! ⁣
↘️If you're looking to start a business or a side hustle, use this extra time to work out a financial budget and business plan to get things going. ⁣
↘️If you're itching to work on a side project and yet you're not sure what to get started with, this is the best time to churn out mini-mini projects to see where your passions truly lie! ⁣
⁣
The point is to JUST GET STARTED! 🙂⁣
There's one more month to go, that's A LOT OF TIME! ⏰⁣
What are you going to work on / improve / explore in the next four weeks?
