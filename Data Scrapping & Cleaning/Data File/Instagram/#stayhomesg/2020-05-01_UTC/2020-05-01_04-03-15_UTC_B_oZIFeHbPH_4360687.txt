Pizzas🍕 were gorgeous and light with just right amount chew to the crust. The Stracciatella, Prosciutto, Rucola & Fig Vincotto is surprisingly full of bright, vibrant flavours, made more comforting with dollops of soft cheese. And I was especially taken with the combo of Broccolini, Pancetta, Pumpkin & Smoked Mozzarella, with aged balsamic vinegar accentuating the earthy, sweetness of pumpkin.

Both Butter Roasted Spring Chicken with Rosemary Jus, enjoyed with baby spinach and thinly sliced Roman potatoes, and Crsipy Calamari—travelled well, and the crunchy batter teamed beautifully with the Sumac & Sundried Tomato Aioli—were stunning.

My personal pick was the quiet winner of Caserecce—uneven twists of al dente handmade pasta, radiating a delightful saffron burst, delicate hints of black pepper and strips of guanciale for a smokey savouriness. 😍 #FindNewFood
