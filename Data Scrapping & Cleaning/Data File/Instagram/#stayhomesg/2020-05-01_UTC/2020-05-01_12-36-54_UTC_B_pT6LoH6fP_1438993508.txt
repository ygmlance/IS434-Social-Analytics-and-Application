Day 1 of #BalanScience 
Getting back to basics, and the real reason why I started Instagram in the first place - to track my progress!  Glad to be able to start capturing my #progresspics once again! 
BOAT POSE! Some absolutely hate it, while some fall head over heels in it; I belong to the latter. Watch to see what happens when you lose your gaze ðŸ¤£
