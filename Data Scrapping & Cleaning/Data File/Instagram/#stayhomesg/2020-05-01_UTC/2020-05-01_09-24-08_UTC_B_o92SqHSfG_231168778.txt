Day 25 of #stayhomesg #circuitbreakersg ...
Chicken had a shock today. He thought he was the only chicken in the world. He met a tinier and cuter chicken. How is that possible?
...
The new chick is called Baby Chicken.

I don’t know if I’ll have any more adventures with Chicken and Baby Chicken because my human daughter has kidnapped both as they’re too cute.
