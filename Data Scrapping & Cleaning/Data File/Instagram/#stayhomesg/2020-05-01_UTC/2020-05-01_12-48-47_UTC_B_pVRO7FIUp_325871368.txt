What happens to your #insurance when you #lose your #job?

Yes, your #policy protects you against the #financial difficulties, which may arise due to uncertain health conditions or situations. When these unfortunate incidents happen, you want peace of mind that you and your #family continue to have a source of income.

Keeping yourself covered against uncertainty is probably the best gift you can give your #loved ones.

These are the few options to sustain your policy even in the midst of financial insecurity.

1.Lower your coverage and/or supplementary benefits to reduce premium payable.
2.Pay your premium monthly instead of yearly (or other frequencies) to spread out your #premium #payments.
3.Take a #loan from your policy and repay the loan when you are able to*.
4.Activate the Automatic Premium Loan feature for future premium payments*.
5.For  Investment link policies - Redeem units available in your policy to obtain cash.
6.For Investment link policies - Lower your supplementary benefits to reduce premium payable.
7.For Investment link policies - Utilise units available in your policy to pay premiums.
