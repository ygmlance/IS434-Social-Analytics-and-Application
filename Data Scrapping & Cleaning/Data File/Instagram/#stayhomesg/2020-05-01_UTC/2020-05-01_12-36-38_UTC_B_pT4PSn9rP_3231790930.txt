“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” ~ Helen Keller

What you fill your heart and soul with will be what consumes you. Remember to maintain a positive outlook, no matter how grim your circumstances. This WILL end and we will be okay.

Happy Labour Day, everyone! Let's stay home, stay safe and we will see each other soon.
