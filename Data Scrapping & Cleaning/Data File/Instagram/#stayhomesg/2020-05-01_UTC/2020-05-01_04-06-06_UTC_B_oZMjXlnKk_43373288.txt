Stay safe, in style: in our second episode of #MadeByShentonistas, @dawnbey, the founder of @minormiracles.shop, introduces us to new expressions of style in the time of COVID-19. Follow her as she guides us through a simple tutorial to create a personalised fabric mask with any print of your choice.
For those who’d like to purchase a cloth mask made from the prints shown in the video, you can now place a pre-order with Minor Miracles—DM them for more info! All profits from the masks will be donated to a COVID-19 fund to support the migrant workers affected by the situation.
If you’ve tried your hand at making your own own mask, share with us your experience in the comments!
