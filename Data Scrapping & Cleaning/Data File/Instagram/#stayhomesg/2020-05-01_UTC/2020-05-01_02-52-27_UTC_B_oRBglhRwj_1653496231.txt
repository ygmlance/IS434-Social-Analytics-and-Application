Congrats to Muaaz & Raudhah on your wedding 07032020. Big thanks for having us at your reception. The soft serve ice cream was a hit with your guests. Also thanks to Adelia for liaising & making all the arrangements. Meanwhile, stay safe everyone. We will get thru the current pandemic and we look forward to restarting soon. Have a great Long weekend everyone. .
