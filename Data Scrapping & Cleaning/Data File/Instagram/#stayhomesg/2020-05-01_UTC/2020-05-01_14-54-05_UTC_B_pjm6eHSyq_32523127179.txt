Hummus | Greek salad 🥗
.
🍴Overall ease: 7/10
.
🛒Ingredients: Hummus - chickpeas, lemon, tahini, salt, expensive Greek olive oil. Salad - cucumber, capsicum, cherry tomatoes, red onion, feta, red wine-mustard vinaigrette
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: for the hummus, use dried or canned chickpeas (today we went with the latter as we didn’t plan ahead in time), meticulously peel off the chickpea skins, and place all ingredients in a food processor till smooth. We make hummus often, and a good hummus hinges on quality chickpeas (best if fried and soaked overnight) and tahini (we lugged ours all the way back from Palestine!). For the salad - a matter of chopping up the ingredients and tossing it in a combination of red wine vinegar, mustard, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.

😋Taste: 9/10. Forgot how much we love hummus! It’s creaminess and nuttiness was a great contrast against the bright citrus notes of the salad. Can’t deny that the pretty salad colours also augmented the overall eating experience
