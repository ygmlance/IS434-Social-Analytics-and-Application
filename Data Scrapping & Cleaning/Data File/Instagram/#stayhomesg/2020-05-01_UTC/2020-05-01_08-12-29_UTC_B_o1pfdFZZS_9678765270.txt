𝗥𝗶𝘀𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼 𝗕𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗼 is something worth learning. It's simple and verstatile — once you learn the basics you can easily change up to make any flavoured risotto. I've made mushroom and tomato risotto amongst others, but the classic is still my go-to.

Making risotto is like raising a child. You need to be patient and you want to give it enough love but not too much or too little, or else it'd be fucked up like me.

𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝟭 𝗽𝗮𝘅,
𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀
1/2 onion, diced
1 cup arborio rice
1/4 cup sharp white wine
1 pot chicken/vegetable stock (idk 500ml is probably enough)
1 tbsp butter
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan

1. Add ~2tbsp oil and heat saucepan to medium heat. Add in onions 🌰, cook till soft but not browned.

2. Add in rice 🍚 and toast it. 1 min for normal and 3 mins for more nuttiness. Add wine🥂, let it all evaporate.

3. 𝗔𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗸: 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼. Add in 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗲; don't dump in your whole pot. This is a part by part 20 min process.

4. Slowly and patiently stir to make sure the rice doesn't stick to the bottom, and to cook more evenly.

5. When most stock is absorbed by, add some more. Repeat steps 4-6 until the last pour, add a judicial amount 🤏 so it can be absorbed without overcooking the rice.

6. Nearing the end, scoop the risotto on your spatula and let it slide to see consistency and taste to see if rice is al dente. When dragging your spatula through to reveal the bottom, rice should rush to fill the space.

7. When it's the right consistency (I like it wetter 😩💦) remove it from the heat. Stir in the butter 🧈. Add in the parmesan 🧀 bit by bit to ensure it incorporates evenly. Season with pepper and salt🧂, let rest to thicken.

P.S. PLS DONT FLAME ME ITALIANS IF IT'S NOT AUTHENTIC ENOUGH 🤷🏻
