pandan chiffon cake 🌿 
started learning how to bake a pandan chiffon cake about two years back because it’s one of the few bakes my family members actually enjoy eating HAHA definitely failed many many times before (and I still have trouble removing the moulds now!) still not the easiest but is indeed one of the most rewarding bakes 🥰❤️ #stayhomesg
