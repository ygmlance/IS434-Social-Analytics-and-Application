Drawing is a skill that you can master at any age. With Color Palette, we are going to introduce a fun based 𝐀𝐫𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐩 (𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧!) during this coming May School Holidays.
.
.
.
You'll learn how to draw:
.
• Rainbow Bear 🐻🌈, Potted Plants 🌱, Nesting Dolls or Silhouette 🎨
• Live session and guidance from our teacher. Our teacher will share her thoughts as she draws from a reference image. You will learn how our teacher approaches her subjects, works to outline with proportions, and fills in the details as she sees them fit.
• Tips for developing your personal style too!
.
.
.
This camp is for all skill levels. You would need to prepare only drawing paper and any colouring media such as colour pencils or pastel.
