Hey everyone! I’m really excited and honored to be a guest judge for @SingForSG – A Virtual Charity Talent Competition. Help us in our cause to garner $50K in donations for @foodbanksg, which will help them with their operational costs to deliver the many meals to the needy and essential workers.

Please like @SingForSG, submit a video of your song performance and stand a chance to win $1000 worth of prizes. I hope to see you on the LIVE shows.
