No claypot, using my le creuset which works as well. #claypotrice #rice #homecooking #lecreusetsg #sgeats #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg #singaporehomecooks #sgfoodies #stfoodtrending #8dayseat #burpple #chinesefood #eattheworld #foodgram #onepotmeal #huffposttaste #thekitchn #foodphotography #beautifulcuisines #buzzfeedfood #foodandwine #feedfeed #f52grams #foodbeast #foodstagram #foodiegram #foodspotting #foodgawker #heresmyfood
