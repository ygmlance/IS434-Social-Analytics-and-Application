Have you submitted your photos for the #PolaroidStayHome challenge? .
During this time of the 'circuit breaker' in Singapore, we're looking for photos/submissions that follow the theme 'STAYHOME'. Whether it may be the things you're doing at home or just love ones you're spending more time with during this period. We want your interpretation.
