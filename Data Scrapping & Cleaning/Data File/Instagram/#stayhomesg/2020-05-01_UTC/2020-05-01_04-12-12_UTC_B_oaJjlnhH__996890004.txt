Labour Day 🔨: A celebration for the workforce. In the year 2020, this truly strikes a chord with every one in the world right now. Whether you still have a job or not, today is a day we truly appreciate what we had and have. 🙏🏻

Today, my team and I would like to shoutout to our frontliners in essential services. It is truly every one of you that is keeping Singapore going! 🔗

Every day as you head out, you worry, and your family worries, for your safety. And we truly salute you for that. You guys make up the defence of this country, just like soldiers. Thank you for your bravery! 💙

Happy Labour Day. Majulah Singapura 🇸🇬
