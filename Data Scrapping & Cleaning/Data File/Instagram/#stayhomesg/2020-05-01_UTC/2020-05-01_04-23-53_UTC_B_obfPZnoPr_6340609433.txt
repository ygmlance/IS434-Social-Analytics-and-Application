Enjoying our Labour Day at home with one of our old school favourite traditional sliced cakes from Gin Thye! We missed these old school traditional cakes as we used to love it in our younger days and it’s very hard to find it nowadays. Not many places still makes this old school traditional cakes, but we are so delightful that Gin Thye still sells it and it’s very tasty too, not too sweet for our liking and it brings back good old memories! .
