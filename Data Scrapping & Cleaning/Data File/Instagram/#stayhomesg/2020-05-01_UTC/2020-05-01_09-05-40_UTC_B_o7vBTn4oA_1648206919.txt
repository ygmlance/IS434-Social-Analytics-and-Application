Can you believe it? We’re entering our 3rd weekend on this new delivery menu, and it feels so long ago since we were operating like a regular restaurant.

How time flies! Well, we’re definitely not having fun, but we’re hanging in there and not giving up.

Thanks to all for the wonderful support. It might sound cliche, but every delivery order you make, is keeping our head above the waterline, and a step closer to seeing you again, back in Esplanade after the circuit breaker ends.

If you’re thinking of ordering for the first time, or re-ordering our homemade Peranakan delights, here’s another two quintessential Nonya dishes to excite your tastebuds.

Photo 1: Ayam Buah Keluak
Braised spring chicken, spice paste and buah keluak.

Photo 2: Kueh Salat
Sticky glutinous rice topped with fragrant pandan custard.

Just remember, we’re open everyday for lunch and dinner, and there’s FREE DELIVERY ISLANDWIDE for orders $50 and above.
