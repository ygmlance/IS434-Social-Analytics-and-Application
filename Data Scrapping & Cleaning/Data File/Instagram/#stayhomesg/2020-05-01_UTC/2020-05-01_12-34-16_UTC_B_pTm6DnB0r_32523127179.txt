Red Curry | Chicken | Kailan 🐔🍛🥬
.
🍴Overall ease: 7/10
.
🛒Ingredients: homemade red curry paste, chicken, kailan, coconut milk
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: took reference from an all-purpose curry paste recipe from @ntmrkt , but used whatever protein and leafy green we had on hand. The curry paste was a blend of lemongrass, galangal, chili, curry leaves (couldn’t find kaffir lime), shallots, garlic, and dried shrimp. Cooked it with coconut milk, palm sugar, fish sauce, and turmeric - volia!
.
😋Taste: 9/10. This curry paste is a flavour bomb, yet not too ‘jelat’. Would definitely use it again, and again, and again.
