We saw from handsome @diviannair @wearemajulah about creating our own DIY Singapore flag and displaying them on Labour Day, so we too decided to involve the girls in making our own Singapore flag in support of the #StayHomeforSG movement because all of us are in this together ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Å£
‚Å£
Let‚Äôs display our Singapore flag at home to show our unity, solidarity and resilience together ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Å£
