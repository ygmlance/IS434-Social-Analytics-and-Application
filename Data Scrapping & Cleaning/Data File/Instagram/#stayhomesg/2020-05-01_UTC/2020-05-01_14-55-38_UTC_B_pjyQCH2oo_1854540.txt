Lost count the number of days since we entered CB. 🤔Everyday feels the same with the same routine, that also explains the lack of post, but today, for the first time since CB started, I stepped out of the house with my parents to run some errands.🏃 It was indeed quite difficult to breath with the cloth mask on and I got to experience scanning of IC to enter NTUC. 😂 That's my little bit of amusement for the day!

HBL has came to and end for #M姐 on Thursday cos her school has made next Monday a PTM day.📚 Lucky her, and lucky me too!

Oh and that's a banana 🍌 cake that #M姐 baked for the second time, consecutive day after the first cake received much praises from us! Using a recipe that she randomly found on YouTube. Impressed. 👍🏻
