Day 25 circuit breaker. Barley meal. Barley Risotto & Lemon barley.
Today i Google what can i do for barley besides making drinks and desserts.
To my surprise there are such a thing as barley risotto,  barley fried rice,  barley congee and barley porridge.
I tried making a risotto as i can't fried, as the barley needed to be overnight in the fridge like the common fried rice logics.
I think i I over cooked it, is a bit dry for a risotto.
It is a slightly not too wet fried barley.😁
Ok. It is in between a risotto and a fried rice. 
And the last portion of the drinks has been upgraded to Lemon barley.😁 #jasmine_homecooked #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithst
