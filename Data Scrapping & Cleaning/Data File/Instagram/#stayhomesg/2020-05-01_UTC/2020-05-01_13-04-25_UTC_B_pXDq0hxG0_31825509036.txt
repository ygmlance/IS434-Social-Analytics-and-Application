The amazing thing about the angler fish is that it is able to create light from the very juices that make him up.  We can be as buoyant as this strange fish this month too, can't we? ðŸ˜€This month of May, SoundMind.SG, will feature tips, quotes, in-house write-ups, fun stuff and all things mental health(y).
