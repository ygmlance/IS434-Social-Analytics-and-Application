Mama, today is so beautiful and smooth sailing. Alhamdulilah‚ù§

As I was planning your journey, I have people coming up to me and acknowledging to know you and insist to assist me in every step of your journey. 
MasyAllah, you have friends from every walk of lives who is there for you. Just like how you are always there for everyone and anyone. You are so loved by many, Mama.

Mama, you are the epitome of a Fighter. Knowing your fears of doctors and meds, you still fight your way through to be cleared of Covid19. You have fought well Mama and its now time for you to rest. 
Don't you worry about your soulmate. As much as it pains us to see him losing his bearings without you. He will do fine, inshaa allah with us by his side. 
Thank you Mama for moulding us, me especially for this moment. For being able to stay strong and steadfast in believing in Qada and Qadr. As much as it pains me to see you leave, I know that Allah swt has made it so beautiful for you to depart on a Thursday in the month of Ramadhan and especially during these Covid19 period. May you be placed amongst the righteous and be granted the highest place in Jannah, inshaa allah aamin.
