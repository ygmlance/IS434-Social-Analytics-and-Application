My favourite goes to the huge and crunchy unshelled prawn swimming in the delicious Chilli crab sauce, I should have ordered some mantou to wipe up the remaining sauce. The beef cube was tender with hint of wok-hei fragrant. Lastly, the fragrant fried rice that is brimming with ingredients such as shrimp and char siew.
