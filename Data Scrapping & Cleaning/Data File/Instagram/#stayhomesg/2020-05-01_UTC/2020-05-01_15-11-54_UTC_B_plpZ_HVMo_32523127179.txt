Meatballs | Green Goddess Dressing 🧆
.
🍴Overall ease: 7/10
.
🛒Ingredients: meatballs - minced beef, mixed spices, onions; dressing - 2 avocados, dollops of yogurt, coriander, basil, lemon juice
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: meatballs - used @ottolenghi’s kofta recipe, but shaped them round instead. Sear on a stovetop roll charred on the outside, before finishing in the oven at 220 degree for 2-3 mins.
Dressing - recipe from @half baked harvest. Blend all the ingredients in a food processor, and adjust the ingredient proportions till you achieve your favourite balance of sour, salty, and freshness. Minimal effort, maximum flavour.
.
😋Taste: 9/10. Referenced @ottolenghi’s kofta’s recipe for the meatballs (because I love it and find every chance to use it), and nestled them the “green goddess sauce”, which is sour and creamy and herbaceous in the best way possible.
