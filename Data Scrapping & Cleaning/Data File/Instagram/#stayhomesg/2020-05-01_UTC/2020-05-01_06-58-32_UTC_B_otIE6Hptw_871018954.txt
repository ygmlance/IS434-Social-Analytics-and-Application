Are you wondering what to do today? ⁣
⁣
We've been having so much fun at our virtual parties and we’re pleasantly surprised that we had so much fun from the comfort of our homes! At our Glam Up Quarantine pyjama party, we sang with @shiliandadi and had an afternoon sleepover session, of course not forgetting dressing up for the #pillowchallenge and innovative bedsheet gowns 😆⁣
⁣⁣
It's time to get social with your friends during this #circuitbreaker period. Take a break from your dramas, cooking, exercising, webinar… and spend some virtual time with your friends! Got a birthday or just want to celebrate but don’t know where to start? We got you covered. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Just simply let us know what you have in mind, and we’ll make that happen. Whether it’s a ladies pyjama party, a dudes beer & trivia night… the possibilities are “virtually” endless!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
From physical to virtual events, we’re going to make yours an awesome one! ⁣⁣
