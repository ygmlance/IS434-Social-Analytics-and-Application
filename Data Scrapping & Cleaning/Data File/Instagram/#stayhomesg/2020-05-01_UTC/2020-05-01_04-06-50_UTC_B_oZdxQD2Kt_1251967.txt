BROWN SUGAR LATTE?!
Since I have leftover Brown Sugar from the time I made brown sugar boba, I decided to make a drink instead. No boba this time round but the Brown Sugar tasted really good on its own
.
Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare the Brown Sugar syrup: 10g Dark Brown Sugar with 35g water (the amount used in the video is much higher to show the distinctive layers)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Stir and bring 1Ô∏è‚É£ to boil,
3Ô∏è‚É£ Add in Ice cubes until 80% full
4Ô∏è‚É£ Pour Fresh Milk till the level of the Ice Cubes
5Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare 40ml of Espresso (I‚Äôm using @Nespresso.SG capsule) and pour onto the fresh milk
