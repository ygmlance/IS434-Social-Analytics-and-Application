Salmorejo is a Spanish cold tomato soup eaten specially in the south. It is not gazpacho, but we can consider it a brother. Simple recipe : you only need 1kg tomatoes, 1 garlic clove, 200g bread, 100ml best olive oil you can get your hands to. 
In a bowl, mix tomatoes and bread and let the bread soak the tomato juices. Then in a blender or thermomix, mix all the ingredients together. Serve with toppings such as minced boiled egg  or diced red pepper. Enjoy!
