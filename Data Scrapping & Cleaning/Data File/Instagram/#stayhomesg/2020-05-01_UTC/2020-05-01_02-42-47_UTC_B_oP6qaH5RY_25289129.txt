Ingredients: water, brown sugar, pandan leaves, agar-agar, coconut milk and food colouring (red, yellow, green & blue. I used both red & blue to create purple) general rules: 1 cup of sugar for 1 litre water, 150ml water to dissolve 1 tsp agar agar powder, 300ml water to dissolve 2 tsp agar agar powder and so on

I used 18cm mould and I boiled 3.5 litres water with 3.5 cups brown sugar and 3 knotted pandan leaves (1 knot is 3 leaves) to make sugar water. You may need lesser water and sugar if your mould is smaller. For the first layer, 300ml of sugar water, 2 tsp agar agar powder, in a small cooking pot, boil to dissolve agar agar powder with low heat cooking, stir well. Add a dip of blue food colouring and mix well. Pour the first layer into the mould and wait for it to set naturally in room temperature, about 10-15 minutes to fully set & harden. Repeat the same thing for the second layer when the first layer is fully set, the difference is I added 4 tbsp coconut milk for my second layer. Alternate layer with coconut milk. Example: 1st layer, blue jelly, 2nd layer, blue jelly with coconut milk, 3rd layer, pink jelly, 4th layer, pink jelly with coconut milk and so on! I made total 12 layers for this rainbow jelly agar agar cake ðŸŒˆ it took me about 3.5 hours ðŸ¤£

We had red eggs too for his birthday because in our culture, eggs symbolise a new start and red colour symbolises prosperity and good fortune. Serving those eggs on @ange_singapore blue silicone plate (matching colour with the cake haha..)

Nothing is impossible when thereâ€™s no one selling birthday cake and the best thing about rainbow jelly cake is you donâ€™t need baking experience at all! ðŸ¤£
