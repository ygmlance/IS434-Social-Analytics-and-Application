To all the chefs, cooks and F&B staff who are working hard to keep our stomachs filled so that we don’t go hungry, thank you.⁠
To all the delivery personnel who are pushing tirelessly so that our food and essentials get delivered to us, thank you.⁠
To all the doctors, nurses and medical workers who are sacrificing themselves so that the rest of us will remain safe, thank you.⁠
To all other essential workers who are toiling relentlessly during these trying times so as to sustain the economy, thank you.⁠

Words are not enough to express our gratitude for your self-sacrifice and tremendous help during this difficult period. Happy Labour Day to you all, and we hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Together, we can overcome this!⁠
