Earl Grey Sourdough ☕️🍞
.
🍴Overall ease: 1/10
.
🛒Ingredients: Earl grey tea leaves, earl grey tea, flour, starter, salt
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: same sourdough recipe as always, except to use early grey tea in place for water, and folded in a copious amount of tea leaves.
.
😋Taste: 9/10. The bread was a tad too dense (probably due to our inept folding technique), but the flavour was complex, and amazing - strong floral fragrance, with a slightly bitter finish. We had it with hummus during dinner, and it was unexpectedly symbiotic - such a great treat!
