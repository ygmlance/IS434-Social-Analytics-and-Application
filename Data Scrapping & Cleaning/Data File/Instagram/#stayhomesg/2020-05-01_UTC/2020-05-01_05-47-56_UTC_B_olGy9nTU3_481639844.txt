On this Labour Day, we salute all who work hard from home or at the frontline, in different capacities to help Singapore tide over these challenging times.
-
Be it healthcare providers, service staff, teachers, transport workers, security officers and many others who are giving their all to keep Singapore going, they deserve a big dose of gratitude.
-
If someone you know has been working hard and you would like to show your appreciation, gift them with a $25 ice cream gift voucher as a way of saying Thank You!
-
For every voucher purchased, The Daily Scoop will donate $5 to the #ShowWeCareSg campaign.
