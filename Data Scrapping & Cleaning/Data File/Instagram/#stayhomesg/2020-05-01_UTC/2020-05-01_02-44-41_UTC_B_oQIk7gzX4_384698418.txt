Incoming transmissions!

The school holidays are here and we would like to invite parents and their younglings to kick off the holidays to participate in fun activities that you can complete, all from the comfort of your own home!

We've got two little challenges lined up for you:
1. Dress Up Competition!
2. Recreate Your Favourite StarWars Scenes!

The best part? Stand a chance to win cute sets of StarWars Tsum Tsum foldable totebags sponsored by our friends from Reed & Singapore Comic Con - SGCC!

We'll put up TWO posts tonight with more details each of the activities and instructions on how to participate!

In the mean time, stay safe!
