Holidays coming! In my blog @growinghearts123 bio, I also shared on Chinese learning habits and this post on Ximalaya will come in handy during this #stayhome period.
I have 40 links of free audio chinese books here you can listen and enjoy together even if you don't have the books! 
Check out these other awesome instagrammers that makes Chinese so much more fun too.
