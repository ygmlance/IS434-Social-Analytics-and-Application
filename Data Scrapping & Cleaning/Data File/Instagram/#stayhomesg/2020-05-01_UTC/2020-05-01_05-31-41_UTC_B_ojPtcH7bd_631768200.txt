This is just very impromptu.
I never stock up any Candy winter melon strips  冬瓜条 or pandan leaf which i usually add to my homemade barley.
I never plan to cook at all. But i still have red dates to enhance the taste.
My first time using organic barley. The liquid is actually very clear very different from the other types of barley.
It expand a lot when cooked.
I can actually add brown rice to it and made a congee.
Very good for losing weight. Lesser carbohydrates.
Add to green bean soup also can.
Can definitely fills the tummy the healthier way.😊 #stayhomewith_fuchiko
