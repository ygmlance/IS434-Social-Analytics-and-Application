Local snack brand, Fupi launched 2 new flavours inspired by hotpot soup base - Hotpot Tomato and Sichuan Mala. 
Singaporeâ€™s first beancurd skin snack company that offers beancurd skin crisps added with addictive flavours and packed with high protein and fibre. And also they are vegan-friendly! 
I have to say the Sichuan Mala flavour is legit, can taste hints of peppercorn but on the other hand itâ€™s not too overly spicy or numb, so I finished quite a lot at one go, while Hotpot Tomato is savoury sweet, actually I love tomato flavoured snacks ðŸ˜‹ 
Fupi is available on Shopee, Lazada as well as 7-eleven islandwide! Â http://www.fupi.co/
