Indoor obstacle course for the kids during lockdown.We did a few rounds for them to get the groove😀

It's been a challenging month with 1 more to go! Kids have been upgrading alot faster with Mommy and Daddy presence.

Grateful for their behavior over the past month.We used to go out for outdoor activities at least twice a week now to zero💔

With fasting in Ramadan ongoing  and  both mommy/daddy still working from home. 
Something to look back  on when it's all over and how the experience has shaped us as a family ♥️
