Starting him on the alphabets of his name. Supervising a 2 and a half year old is exhausting! I can understand why some parents just allow their toddlers to watch YouTube for long hours at a time because it is easy and convenient. But I don’t think I want that for Kerstan. I don’t want him to be a TV/mobile phone zombie so I am trying to include more educational yet fun activities for him. #theperksofcovid19 #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomesg #toddlerlife #toddleractivities #coloringtime #learningletters #kerstankillianlee
