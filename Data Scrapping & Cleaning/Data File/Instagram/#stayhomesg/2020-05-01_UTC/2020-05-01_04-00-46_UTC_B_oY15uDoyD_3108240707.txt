Do you know that with more people staying at home, the amount of refuse that we create has also increased? @mewrsingapore 
We know that it is unavoidable but perhaps we can repurpose some of these materials into activities and crafts that we can enjoy with our little ones at home. 
A recycled shoebox craft storage: 
By giving a shoebox some paint/wrapping, we could easily decorate it into an all purpose craft storage box for your child. Doing so will encourage a neat and tidy arts and crafts area! If you have multiple children, they can each have their own too! Helping to foster ownership and care of their own items (: For more recycled arts and crafts ideas:
