May Day with @freetherobot.sg and @bittersandlove ! The Tiki #pinacolada #cocktail🍍 was amazing - loved the presentation and the sustainable pineapple is now infusing it’s delicious flavours into gin for its next use! 
The Mac & Cheese was a huge hit at home with much praise for the smoky flavours! The beef cubes & chicken wings are my fave bar snacks when I’m there! 
The #bubbletea was a joy & I loved the packaging! 
Can’t wait to be back! 🥂
