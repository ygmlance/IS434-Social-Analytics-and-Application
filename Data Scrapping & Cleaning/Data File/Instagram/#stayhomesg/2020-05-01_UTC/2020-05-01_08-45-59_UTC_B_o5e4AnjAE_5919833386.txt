Our drivers and delivery riders are hard at work helping us stay home and #flattenthecurve. So on your next order, send them an encouraging message using GrabChat (and remember to add a ðŸ’š). With the new normal of contactless delivery, a small gesture like this can give them a well-needed boost. 
Or you can head to the link in our bio and get our appreciation door hangers. Just print at home and theyâ€™re ready to go! 
When youâ€™re done, share it with us! Just tag us and use the hashtag #GrabtitudeðŸ’š
