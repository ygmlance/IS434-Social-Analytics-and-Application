Getting ready for Zoom Tadarrus with participants from Masjid Pusara Aman every Mon-Fri morning 8am to 10am.

Just one among many amazing things that happen during this pandemic is the ability to be far yet close. No excuses for not doing alot of things we have always missed out on due to our busy schedule. Classes are brought to the comfort of your own home. So seize every opportunity.

I also signed up some webminars to fill my time with learning. No matter how much you know, there are always alot more to learn. Though baking have to stop for now, no time should be wasted. 
Challenge yourself by filling up your time with knowledge and positivity.
