1 May 20 [#CircuitBreakerSG Day 25] :: Ewan says the Anniversary party isn’t over yet. He wants to make a prata dinner for daddy because it’s his favourite. .
.
Why though? How did our failed pancake attempt the last time turned into a failed prata attempt this time!? .
Last week, I wanted to make pancakes for the kids but my recipe ended up having us eating prata instead. It was a blessing in disguise because hey! I now know how to make prata! So tonight, with the same recipe, we mixed the ingredients in preparation for prata. Look what just happened. It must be the magic touch of my new frying pan - turning recipes exactly into what they should be. .
.
We got ourselves pretty pancakes instead! Since we’ve already arrived at this stage, I took a step further to make it visually appealing for the kids. .
.
To ensure Ewan and Faye still got their dinner greens instead of a fruity platter, I added @haruplate Haru Box ready-cut sweet potatoes and pumpkins on the side. Popped in a little cauliflower as their pancake bunny’s bobtail!
.
Poor daddy settled for instant noodles instead because pancakes aren’t for big man over dinners.

Bunny plating inspired by @naturallyzuzu. She used whipped cream as the bunny’s bobtail for a sweet delectable fruity breakfast meal while I opted for a savoury option.
