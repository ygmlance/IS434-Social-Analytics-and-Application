Prawns are probably one of my favorite ingredients of all times. It’s so versatile and easy to cook!

Got these amazing prawns from the seafood sections of @coldstoragesg this morning, it’s always good to cook them on the same day. We bought 8 giant prawns for around $16. Huge and fresh, the flesh is firm and sweet! Good enough for domestic cooking. 
However, if you can’t always go to supermarket due to social distancing measures, you can still make very presentable and tasty dishes with your staple of frozen prawns at home before your next visit. 3 personal tricks that I must use whenever I cook frozen prawns:

1. Defrost and soak them in a huge tub of salt water. This will help getting rid of the “frozen” taste and will ensure the prawn meats won’t be too soggy. 
2. For Chinese dishes, after defrosting, you can always marinate it with a little bit of salt, sugar, white pepper powder, five spices powder and cooking wine. This will give your frozen prawns a kick in flavor instead of tasting too bland. 
3. Consider the dish that you’re going to cook. If you’re cooking the prawns in dishes that is with a sauce base (like curries, tomato-based pasta sauce etc), frozen prawns are perfectly acceptable.

However if you manage to get your fresh prawns like me this morning, you probably don’t need any tips from me cos your dish confirm will be nice already!

Try these tricks at home and see if they work for you or not. Or if you are bored at home and don’t know what to cook for lunch/dinner, just give me a buzz :-) #stayhomesg  #sgunited
