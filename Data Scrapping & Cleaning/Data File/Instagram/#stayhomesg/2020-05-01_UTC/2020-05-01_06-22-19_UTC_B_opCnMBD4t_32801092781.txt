Circuit breaker Day 25: Unbeatable fish head/sliced fish noodle soup 👍👍👍 My go-to place for 鱼片米粉汤! This one is the zichar store XO kind, not your hawker clear soup kind. Broth so rich, flavourful & creamy no other fish soup comes close. (Ok there are other fish soups are nice in their own way, e.g. fresh, light taste). Each bowl is around $7, but worth every dollar! Huge, fresh pieces of fish 🐟 The only reason I go to Balestier once in awhile is for this bowl of goodness.
📍Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee (Balestier Rd)
