Start of my favourite month of the year - May! Happy Labour Day everyone!

I got to my work table today, folding the printed pages. Working with 120gsm natural pages in dotted print. It takes a little more time to fold printed pages and getting them to match, but when it does, there is simply no words to describe that feeling! (Any folks relate to this feeling? ðŸ¤—) Totally worth my efforts on labour day. ðŸ˜Š What have you been working on during this #stayhome period?
