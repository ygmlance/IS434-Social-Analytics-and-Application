[#SGUNITED] As we celebrate Labour Day differently this year, The Passage New York team would like to dedicate this post to all healthcare workers. We express our gratitude and support to everyone working tirelessly at the front-line and making sacrifices for the nation. If your loved ones and friends are in the healthcare industry, tag and write a dedicated message to them in the comments below!
We will get through this together ðŸ’•
