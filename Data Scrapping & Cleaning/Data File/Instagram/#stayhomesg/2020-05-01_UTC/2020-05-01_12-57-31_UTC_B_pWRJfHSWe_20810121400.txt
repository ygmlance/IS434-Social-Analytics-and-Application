Homemade portugese egg tarts!!!
This took me really almost the entire day, there was so much effort needed but the outcome was satisfying and worth it!! Got the receipe from both @cooking_tree & @HADAathome (both from youtube, find their baking videos from there!) and did a mix and match. 
For tart/dough: (makes about 12 tarts)
Used @cooking_tree tart receipe as follow: 
150g (1cup) plain flour
35g unsalted butter (Mix above two tgt)
2g salt (a pinch)
3g sugar (1/4 tspn)
Add above two to 65g water
Mix water mixture to dry ingredient to form a dough.

Take out 80g butter and set aside to room temperature and cut them into 3 portion.

Roll the dough out, spread one portion of the butter evenly and fold them in to 
Repeat the steps as follow:
Roll spread chill 1h
Roll spread chill 30mins
Roll spread and roll them up instead and chill 1h

Cut the rolled dough into small cubes and spread it on a mould (spread butter on the mould first so you can remove the egg tart easily!) .

Custard: (Makes about 8 tarts of custard)
Using HADAathome receipe here:

3 egg yolks
1tspn corn starch and add 20ml of milk then mix
On super small fire, boil 180ml milk + 50g sugar + 2g salt to dissolve the sugar.
Thereafter, milk mixture to starch content and mix. Then sieve the liquid mixture before pouring into the tart. 
Preheat and Bake for 40mins at 180-200deg celcius (depends on how strong your oven is) or bake till you see the charredness on the egg tart!
