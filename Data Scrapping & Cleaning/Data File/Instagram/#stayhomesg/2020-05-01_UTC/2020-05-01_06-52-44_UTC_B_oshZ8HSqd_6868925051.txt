I was looking at this baby with sadness. Her lover, a wonderful wonderful angel, has since gone to heaven.

I was thinking this angel was so vibrant on earth, bringing light to wherever she went. She must be a shiny star in heaven now.

Then i stopped. i saw something in my baby which i have never seen before. A little girl full of positivity, attempting to be a superhero aiming to fly towards a shining star.

This baby is the story of the angel! The angel dealt with her illness with so much positivity that she defied death several times. And yes, she was always aiming for the star. No matter what she was told, her eyes were always fixed on her star. 
This baby was meant for her way before i knew it. While i have no idea what happened to my baby after her death, i find comfort in knowing this baby was made for her from very beginning. 
May she rest in peace and be a shiny star to all who were blessed to know her on earth.
