Beef short ribs sliced thickly for a stir fry. Pan fry the beef on both sides for a  couple of minutes on a hot hot pan. Remove from pan then fry the thinly sliced leek until fragrant. Add some brown sugar and oyster sauce. Then return the beef to the pan, together with sliced capsicum. Just about 2-3 mins then remove. The beef is very tender because itâ€™s a good cut. I made the spring rolls without any meat. Just shallots, carrots and turnips. Wrap them and fry them. ðŸ˜Š together with an old cucumber soup. #dinner #stayhomesg
