Be prepared to be stunned into silence by the gigantic Kaya Cream Choux Buns by Pastry Chef @lusianadarusman at @allium.sg.
It tasted so spectacular I gave myself up to the singular pursuit of luxuriating in the pleasure of every bite. How the thin wall of airy-light choux pastry could contain that volume of insanely fragrant kaya and cream filling remains a mystery. But wow, wow, wow.... this is a dessert you should not miss.
To best enjoy the Choux Buns (they are sold as a pair for $18), keep them chilled in the fridge until you are ready to eat. It helps to cut them carefully in half, then swiftly tilt the pieces up onto their sides so the voluptuous kaya cream can be contained. Then close your eyes and take your own sweet time to lose yourself in the moment.
