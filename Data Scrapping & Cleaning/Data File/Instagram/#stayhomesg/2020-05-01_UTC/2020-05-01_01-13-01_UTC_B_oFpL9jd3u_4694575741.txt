Circuit Breaker Day 25: Happy Labour Day! After so many years finally this year is a long Labour Day break for us. Thanks to Covid19. ðŸ˜·

We still have 1 more month to go before we break this CB (hopefully no extend further). Just finish watching 5 feet Apart. Just like what we've been practicing. Observe safe distancing always. Stay safe everyone! #stayhomesg #sgunitedðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ #covid19aroundtheworld
