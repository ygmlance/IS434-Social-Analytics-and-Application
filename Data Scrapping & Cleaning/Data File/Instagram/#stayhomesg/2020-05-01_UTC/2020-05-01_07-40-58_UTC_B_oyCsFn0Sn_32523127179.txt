Hokkien Mee (Version II)🦐🦑🍜
.
🍴Overall ease: 5/10
.
🛒Ingredients: yellow noodles, thin bee hoon, prawns, squid, clams, chives
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: daddy bear’s recipe; the magic is in boiling pork bones and prawn heads for hours to create a robust stock!
.
😋Taste: 10/10. A perennial family favourite, and one that we fry up from time to time. This version differs from the last round in that we chose to use the thinner bee hoon, which we prefer over the thick version as it soaks up more sauce! Although we weren’t able to obtain the ‘wok-hei’ that one would get from hokkien mee from hawker stalls, we’re at least able to reduce the salt and lard in the dish, and to pile on all the seafood we want~
