Our 3-year old daughter dreams for a watch since she first saw her P1 brother wearing a watch to school early this year. On #HappyLabourDay #HappyLaborDay 2020, during her free play time while I was cooking our lunch, she "made" watches for herself, her brother, parents and grandmother by drawing her dream #rainbowWatch and cutting a @flikflak advertisement from @hellolunchlady issue 14, one of my favourite magazines. Recently, she loves cutting papers to make #papertoy. Thank you for reminding me that "mastery requires time and labour" and to cherish now and here. #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious
