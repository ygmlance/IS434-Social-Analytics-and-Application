Just before turning these beauties into "fruit chaat"; essential item of an iftar table. I basically use apples, bananas and grapes with orange juice, salt and pepper and sometimes a drizzle of cream on top. But occasionally I do make the "lahore liberty" version also. (With yogurt, chaat masala, sweet chutney, chickpeas, tinned and dried fruit)

Would love to hear what recipe you follow ? .
