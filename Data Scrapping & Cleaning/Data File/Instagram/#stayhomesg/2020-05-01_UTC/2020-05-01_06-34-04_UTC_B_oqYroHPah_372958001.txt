1 May 20 [#CircuitBreakerSG Day 25 | On The Blog | bit.ly/2W8vTcE] :: Happy Thirteenth Anniversary!
.
I told Meyer we got to make this seems REAL! We shall dress up and "go out" for this date. We left the kids "at home" with a movie running and we "went out" for our May Day brunch!
.
#fayefaye妹妹 asked, "Where are you guys going! Wear so nice!"
.
#bigbro文 responded, "They are going to the dining room lah."
.
It sounded hilarious! But hey, whatever that sparks joy and novelty to make this Anniversary a special one!
.
Anyhoos, we enjoyed our quiet pre-ordered home-delivered @twobakerssg artisanal brunch date
over coffee and Corona Extra. How else to better capture the Coronavirus season! Have to have the right beer in hand no? Meyer’s got good humour.
.
The children were particularly sweet today. This morning, even before the sun rose, Faye mumbled, "Anniversary Anniversary. Happy Anniversary." She spear-headed an Anniversary Card for us too but regretted she coloured in a blue dress on Mommy Bear. "Oh mommy, I should have drawn you a wedding dress. Then you and daddy will look married. Kor Kor sleeping and I eat honey." Cute innocent conversations that I'll miss when they are all grown.
.
Ewan made breakfast for us too. He doesn't know how to make much but he attempted! He made two pieces of bread while we were still in bed and placed it on the table for Meyer and I. Next to it, a note that read “Happy Day to Dad and Mom. From Ewan. Pick a Bread.” This boy. Sweetness Overload but because he is a boy, he cannot be bothered to look for a blank piece of paper to write on. He just grabbed whatever paper was in sight and this one's our Great Eastern insurance letter! *hahah* .
.
Daddy then laughed, "Thanks Ewan but erm, this bread is expired."
.
It is amazing that they even thought about doing little things like these to make it special for us. That is so thoughtful and mature.
. 
To many more years ahead of us! .
.
Thanks Meyer for always providing me with a foot stool from across the table because I cannot reach the floor -cue laughter-
