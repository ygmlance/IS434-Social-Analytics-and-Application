Its been about a month. It wasnâ€™t entirely easy planning activities keeping them busy and ourselves sane. Somehow we pulled it off. There are people somewhere else all over the world staying home in tougher situations and living conditions. We got to salute them for going through this for everyone to get better. Another month to go! Lets give this our best and beat the shit out of the virus! #covid_19  #fightcovid19together #stayhomesg #stayhomestaysafe #sgunited
