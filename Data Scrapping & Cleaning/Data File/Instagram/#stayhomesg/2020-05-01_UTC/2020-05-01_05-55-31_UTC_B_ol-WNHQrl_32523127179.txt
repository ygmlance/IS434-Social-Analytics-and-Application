Oyakodon 🐣🐔
.
🍴Overall ease: 8/10
.
🛒Ingredients: chicken, egg, onions, mushrooms, dashi, soya sauce, mirin, salt, spring onions
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: followed @justonecookbook recipe, except to double the portion of eggs and onions, and add mushrooms (had some that were getting old). Added simmered daikon as a side dish.
.
😋Taste: 7/10. Would have been an 8/10 if we had increased the sodium level to make it more flavourful (to be fair, we used less than what the recipe asked for). Definitely loved the ratio of eggs, onions, and chicken that we chose to go with. Overall a really comforting dish that was perfect amidst the perpetual drizzle outside.
