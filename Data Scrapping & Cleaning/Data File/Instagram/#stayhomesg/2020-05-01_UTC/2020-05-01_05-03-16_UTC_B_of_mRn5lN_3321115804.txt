Craving for some celebratory food ? Why not try making a Korean pancake? Plus , it could be a fun activity for children to participate under parental supervision as well ! We all know staying at home too much can be stressful and painful so we made a super anti-inflammatory pancake . Some flour , one egg, a pinch of baking soda, add in your favorite veggies and Walah!!! For the extra anti-inflammatory kick you could add in 1/2 tsp of turmeric, ginger powder with a pinch of black pepper !
Happy Labour Day everyone !
