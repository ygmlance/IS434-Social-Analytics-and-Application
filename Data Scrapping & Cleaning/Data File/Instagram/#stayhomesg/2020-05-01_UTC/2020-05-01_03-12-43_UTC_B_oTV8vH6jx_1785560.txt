I stocked a few packs of frozen glutinous rice balls at home in case I crave for it. Very easy to cook. Just make sure u have pandan leaves at home. Just boil it together with water, pandan leaves and add some sugar for taste. Ta-da! Roll them inside peanuts powder and it’s so 👍🏻. Always a hit for my kids.
