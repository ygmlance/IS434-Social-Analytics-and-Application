When the little one naps, it’s mummy’s moment to lounge on the couch.

Looking at the rain come and go, it’s difficult not to get all feeling-feeling. How the heck is it already May, and yet so little has been accomplished due to the current situation?!
.
Both Jr and I have been getting more cranky, which I’m officially calling it signs of being stuck at home for way too long. While she somehow evolved into a crybaby and has been generous with her to die for smile, I am trying my best not to go overboard with the reprimanding and the urge to just not do anything.

Though things seem to be crazy and overwhelming in our own ways, we are bloody thankful for a roof over our heads and food on our plate.
.
Please tell me I’m not the only one getting all emotional because of the rain.
