First post of this month goes to this challenge by the Cafe sketchers SG group on FB. .
I chose Nasi lemak as it’s one of my dad’s favourite meals. He often requests for me to ge this for him and the chilli is especially a big love.
.
Ive had lots of memories to this dish and really glad @toastboxsg has this.
