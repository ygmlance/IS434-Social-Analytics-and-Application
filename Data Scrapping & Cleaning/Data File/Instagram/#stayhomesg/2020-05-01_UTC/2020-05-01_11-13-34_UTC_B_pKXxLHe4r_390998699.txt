Marché Movenpick is finally on Grab! We could no longer eat at the Marché terrace so we grabbed a freshly baked wood fire oven pizza! The little one always joins us at the table in his rocker.

What's good?

This rocker is the best toy. He also giggles when we chomp our food. Cute max. #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg#mypineappledays_baby
