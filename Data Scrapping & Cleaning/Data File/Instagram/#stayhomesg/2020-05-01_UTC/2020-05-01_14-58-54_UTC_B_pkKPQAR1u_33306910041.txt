#HappyLabourDay #HappyLaborDay to #busDriver worldwide! On 1-May-2-2020, our P1 son who dreams for #smokefreeSG and loves riding buses wrote #our123gratitude #thankyouletter to you all for fearlessly ferrying essential workers to work everyday amid the #covid19 pandemic. Hope your family and you stay safe always. "To protect Singaporeans from the harmful effects of #secondhandsmoke, the smoking ban was first introduced in October 1970." We are thankful that smoking is banned at any bus interchange, bus terminus, in any omnibus, private bus, private hire bus, #schoolbus. However, some people still smoke near bus stops and the wind blow the second-hand smoke to vulnerable elderly, pregnant women, and children waiting for buses. Our son also shared that at some places when the school bus driver is dropping off students, second-hand smoke would enter and stay in his school bus. Our son sincerely appeals to people who smoke to quit smoking for themselves, their family and others. #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious
