I am not really a snacker but I love to eat mushroom. So glad to find these healthy mushroom chip from @mushroomkingdom_sg. They are low in sodium, no trans fat and only 1% seasoning content. I could really taste the mushroom taste and not salty at all. Even Leodys tried on one and say good, he still do his good sign using the index finger. .
They come in three flavours, original, black pepper and oriental spices. I love the black pepper. .
