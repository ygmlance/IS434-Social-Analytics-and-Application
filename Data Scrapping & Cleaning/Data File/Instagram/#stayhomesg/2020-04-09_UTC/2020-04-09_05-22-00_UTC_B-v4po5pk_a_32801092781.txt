Circuit breaker Day 3: Nasi lemak today👍👍These 4 boxes for $15.40! There were 14 people in front of me in the queue, glad to see business doing well. Fluffy white rice full of panda aroma & crispy chicken wings even after dabao (shout out to the chicken wings - tasted real good, like the homemade kind). The beehoon was tasty, not too oily.
📍 Happy Go Nasi (Compassvale link, near Buangkok)
