Setting a challenge for myself, trying a new dish today: Duck confit in orange zest sauce, with pea shoots, white corn, cherry tomatoes, roasted butternut squash and capsicums.
.
Duck confit was bought frozen and precooked but i encountered a disaster frying it as some water seeped into the broken bag as I dunked them in water to thaw them.
.
By fluke, the orange zest sauce turned out decent when paired with the duck confit.
.
Lots of room for improvement for the next time!
