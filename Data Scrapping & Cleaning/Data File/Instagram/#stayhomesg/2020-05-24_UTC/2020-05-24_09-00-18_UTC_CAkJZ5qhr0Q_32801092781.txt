Circuit breaker Day 48: Teochew duck rice 👍👍 Duck was flavourful, pork belly cooked well too but I much prefer Ah Xiao teochew duck rice. Ah Xiao’s is more generous with the sauce & the duck is evenly sliced, this one has short/long/thin/thick pieces. Still good, but probably wouldn’t join the near-10 pax queue next time.
