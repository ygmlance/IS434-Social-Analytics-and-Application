MATCHA STRAWBERRY SANDWICH?!
Missed travelling to Japan so much that I decided to create something very Japanese this week for #CBfoodieSG theme on MATCHA! Combining various Japanese elements such as matcha, strawberry and soft fluffy bread, think:
.
4 ingredients:
1Ô∏è‚É£ 100ml Whipping Cream
2Ô∏è‚É£ 15g Castor Sugar
3Ô∏è‚É£ 100g Mascarpone cheese
4Ô∏è‚É£ 5g matcha powder
.
Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Pour 100ml of whipping cream into a clean bowl on top of ice water to keep it cool
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add 15g of castor sugar to the whipping cream (this is about 60% sweetness in terms of BBT standard)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Whipped it until it starts to peak
4Ô∏è‚É£ Add in 100g of Mascarpone cheese
5Ô∏è‚É£ Continue whipping for another 6-7mins to form a cream texture before adding 5g matcha powder into it
6Ô∏è‚É£ Put a clean wrap on table top before putting your bread on it
7Ô∏è‚É£ Visualise how your cross section will look like and arrange your fruits
8Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúBuah‚Äù the cream prepared in 5Ô∏è‚É£ onto your fruits generously and ‚ÄúKiap‚Äù it with another slice of bread
9Ô∏è‚É£ Cling wrap it and put into your chiller for 30mins before slicing
