What do you do with cold bread that has been kept in the fridge one day passed expiration? You make French toast with them ðŸ˜‹
.
I just had to clear one slice of brioche and one slice of baguette. Cut brioche into half and sandwiched some cheese in it, coated with lots of egg and pan fried till golden. Load up cheese on pan and place baguette slice on it for that cheesy coating. There you have it. Thatâ€™s also the last of my spinach and tomatoes ; making it valid for me to head to the supermarket later in the day ðŸ˜›
