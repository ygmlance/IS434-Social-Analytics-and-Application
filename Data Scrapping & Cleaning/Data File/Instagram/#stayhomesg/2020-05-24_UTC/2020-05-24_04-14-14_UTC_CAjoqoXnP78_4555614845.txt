Dear all,

We hope that everyone has been staying home and doing well during this Circuit Breaker. We've missed having a good sweat out with all of you so much! However, in light of the rules put in place by the Government post-Circuit Breaker, our PushPullGive gym will continue to close until further notice. As such, we kindly seek for your support and understanding during these trying times.

With no clear indication of when we will be able to open our doors again, it is definitely frustrating for all of us - for you to have your ideal workout, and for us to sustain the business. We will continue pausing all memberships ‪until 30th June‬ and billing will resume ‪on 1st July‬. With that being said, we are forever grateful for staying with us and for not cancelling your membership during this time. To be completely honest, each day of prolonged closure makes it harder for us. However, here are some ways we can continue to support one another!

1️⃣ Virtual Classes
Available for booking at just $10 per class! Or even better, get our 10 class package at just $89 (which works out to be less than SGD9/class)! So why not get a sweat in with us over technology instead? 
2️⃣ PPG Gift Cards 
Or know of a loved one who could do with some tender loving care? Gift them a class! Simply purchase a gift card and we will credit this to your friend's account.

At the same time, let us know how we can support you! Be it wanting a more intimate training session (1-1 online training), more videos covering health and fitness content, or even our help with sharing about your #localbusiness, let us know. We're a community and a community helps one another out. In the meantime, stay healthy and safe...with PPG!
