An example of a snack. ðŸ˜‹

And having been to Osaka thrice, I still feel I haven't seen enough. For example, Nissin's Cupnoodles Museum in Ikeda remains a 'want-to-go'. ONE DAY!

I dig museums, remember?

On a more serious note, I ought to stop eating cup noodles altogether. They aren't exactly cheap (I'm still in between jobs) and good for my health. One day?

Ironic sucker for creature comforts signing out.
