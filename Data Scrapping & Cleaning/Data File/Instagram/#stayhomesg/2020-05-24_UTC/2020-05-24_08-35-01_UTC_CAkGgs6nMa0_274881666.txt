Mystery Thursdays V
Theme: Memory
Budget: ~$100 (for 2 pax)

Our orders for the final Mystery Thursday lunch coincidentally showcased our love for the #LesAmis group of restaurants.

Aoki’s mazechirashi bowl is sublime but I have to admit that some of its magic is lost by doing takeaway. Cant wait to be back at the dine-in counter after #circuitbreakersg! 🍣
