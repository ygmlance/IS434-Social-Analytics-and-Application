Thanks to @kenloon, I learned that @kazusumiyakirestaurant has a Takeaway Menu and in there, is a particular dish that Ken enjoys very much - the “Yaki Tori Chirashi”.
Available in 2 sizes, the Small can feed 1 or 2 pax ($18 / $22) while the Large is good for 3 to 4 pax ($50). Outstanding value if you ask me because regardless of the size you choose, it is essentially an aesthetically-pleasing tray of Japanese rice that smells incredible as it is spread with freshly-grilled pieces of boneless chicken and its exciting “spare parts” (think gizzard, liver, skin etc. but you can request to leave them out if you are the squeamish sort), minced chicken meatballs (these are soft and delicious!), quail’s eggs, shiitake mushrooms and assorted vegetables. Everything is grilled to perfection by the Chef-owner Kazu, which is why the dish has such an intoxicating smokiness. And somehow, that fragrance manages to linger on even when the food has completely cooled down.
If you fancy red meat, the tender and appetisingly-seasoned “Wagyu #Hamburg with Rice” is a steal at $15.
I do however feel the #YakiToriChirashi is the real star of this show and therefore highly recommend it.
