Nephrite Jade is often used in dream work, to help with lucid dreaming, and with remembering dreams.  Nephrite Jade carries a revitalizing energy that can help to speed healing.  It is a stone of health and abundance, allowing Divine energy to enhance the circumstances of life.  Used as a good-luck talisman in many cultures, Nephrite Jade helps open the Heart Chakra to allow good fortune to flow naturally into one's experience of this physical realm. ⠀ ⠀

Known as the stabilizer, Agate is the stone to call on for support when you need stability and grounding in your life. Along with its supportive energy, the Agate stone has been long admired for its incredible beauty, and is known throughout history for its protective qualities. By anchoring you to the Earth, the Agate stone can help boost your sense of balance and centeredness. Agate helps you to slow down and find your center so you can move through life with more grace and ease.
