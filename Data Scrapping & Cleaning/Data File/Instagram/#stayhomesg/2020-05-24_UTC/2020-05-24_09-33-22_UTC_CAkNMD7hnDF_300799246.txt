As Essential workers, we are out everyday to do deliveries...for 2 months, we didnt get any off day...but we are Very Grateful to our customers for engaging YanMaL Xprezz üòò

1st Syawal...We saw Happiness...sadness too...
Alhamdulilah, Raya at home is indeed meaningful... Thank you so much Nindah & Tok Ayah for cooking Raya dishes for us ‚ù§

Whatever happens, theres Hikmah...we need to be patient... Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri Semua! 
Maaf Zahir & Batin from Us, 
Family of YanMaL Xprezz ‚ù§
