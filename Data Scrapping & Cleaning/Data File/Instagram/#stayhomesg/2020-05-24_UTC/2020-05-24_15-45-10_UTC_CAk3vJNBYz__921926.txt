#CovEid2020
Things might be different this Aidilfitri, but that shouldn’t stop us from celebrating our cherished traditions. We are granted with a bit of a twist, to keep our spirits strong as we face the Covid-19 crisis together. Selamat Hari Raya everyone! May we stay safe and emerge from the current situation stronger and more united.
