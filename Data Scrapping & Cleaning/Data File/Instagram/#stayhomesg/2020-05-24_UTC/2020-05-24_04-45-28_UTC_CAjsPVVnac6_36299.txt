🍝 Made a super simple #bolognese #spaghetti yesterday for #lunch w some @prego tomato basil sauce, onions garlic olive oil and @barilla no.5. 👉 I thought I cooked too much pasta. 6 mins later I was confronted with an empty plate 🍽️ and the truth. That I still haven't lost my ability to inhale large quantities of pasta quickly. Lol. So don't be fooled by my usual 2-tablespoon rice dinners. This is what I can do...
