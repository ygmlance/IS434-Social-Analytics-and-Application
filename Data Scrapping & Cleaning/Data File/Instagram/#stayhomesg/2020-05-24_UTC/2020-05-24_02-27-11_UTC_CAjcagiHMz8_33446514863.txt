‚ú®Labradorite Heart-Shaped Crystals
Labradorite is a Stone of Magic, a crystal of shamans, diviners, healers, and all who travel and embrace the universe seeking knowledge and guidance. For self-discovery, it is excellent for awakening one's own awareness of inner spirit, intuition and psychic abilities.

Labradorite is also the most powerful protector of the mineral kingdom, creating a shielding force throughout the aura and strengthening natural energies from within. It protects against the negativity and misfortunes of this world, and provides safe exploration into alternate levels of consciousness and in facilitating visionary experiences from the past or the future. ‚†Ä

‚ú® Ocean Jasper Heart-Shaped Crystals 
Ocean Jasper brings that spirit of peace and letting go, of breathing deeply and consciously, attuning to Nature and being physically and spiritually present in one‚Äôs surroundings.

The Atlantis Stone draws its soothing power from the element of Water. It is a stone of strength and renewal with a slow, steady frequency and a deep circular energy that embodies the interconnectedness of all things. Ocean Jasper is a marvelous stone for cultivating patience and coping with change, and encourages giving service to others. ‚†Ä
