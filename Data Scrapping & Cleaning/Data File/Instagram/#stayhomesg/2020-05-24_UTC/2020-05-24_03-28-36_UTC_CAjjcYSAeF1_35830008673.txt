Are you craving Bak Chor Mee right now?

People go to Loedy Teochew Minced Meat Noodle for their flavourful noodles and crispy pork lard. They even sell Abalone Minced Meat Noodle for just $5! Not just that, they also have the fragrant Double Meatball Soup, Laksa, Teochew Minced Meat Porridge and many more!

GOOD NEWS is that they offer islandwide delivery with NO minimum spend!!! The delivery service is $10 for the taxi drivers. The owners are supplying them with delivery without earning anything for themselves, thus helping taxi drivers who are losing income ❤️ So let’s support Loedy Teochew Minced Meat Noodle and support the taxi drivers!
