Last Friday we have a workshop talking about fitness assessment that you can do at home. This assessment can determine your fitness level as well as to keep you healthy during Covid-19 period. We have to keep ourselves healthy so that when Covid-19 is over, we can continue to strike towards our work or study with a better and stronger body. Join us for our next workshop. We will be talking about some of the recovery method that you can apply at home during this period.
