In another episode of me trying to clear away ingredients... had some frozen chicken katsu cutlets in the freezer, and the leftover bread from the time I made the egg drop looking toast 😆 ⁣

Needed to finish the green grapes I bought from @redmartcom which were super sweet btw!! Also paired with one of my favs from @fairpricesg 's lower tier price range wines!
