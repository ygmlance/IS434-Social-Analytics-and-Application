Meatballs 🧆
.
🍴Overall ease: 7/10
.
🛒Ingredients: Minced Beef, minced pork, breadcrumbs, eggs, parmesan, coriander, garlic, red pepper, onions
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process:  Recipe adapted from one by Ann Burrell via @foodnetwork. Substitutions we made were to use only ground beef and pork (and exclude veal), as well as dial down the Parmesan. Matter of sautéing the onions before mixing all the ingredients altogether, shaping them into golf-ball sized pieces, searing them in a pan, before finishing in the oven at 180c for 15 mins.
.
😋Taste: 9/10. Saw excellent reviews for this recipe and decided to test it against our fav @ottolenghi koftas. While the ingredients differ slightly, we have to admit that these meatballs might be better in texture! Soft, yet just enough to hold a shape. Ottolenghi includes spices in his mix, so taste might be a matter of personal preference, but the straightforward seasoning used here was a winner as well. The recipe suggested for the meatballs to be served with a marinara sauce, but we felt that the meatballs could easily hold their own. Might be our new go-to :)
