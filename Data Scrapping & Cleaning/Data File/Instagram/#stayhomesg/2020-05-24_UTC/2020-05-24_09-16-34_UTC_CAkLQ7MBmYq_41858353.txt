‚Å£It took me a while but I think I've officially caught onto the homemade pizza craze- ‚†Ä
Octopus, burrata, asparagus, and a JB ah meng-inspired white pepper clam sauce on a 70% hydration, 24-hour fermented dough‚†Ä

The shape is oval cause I had so much trouble transferring the dough onto my baking surface, still a long long way more to go but I'd say this was a pretty good first try. Super excited to try and perfect the dough and all the possible toppings that could come along with it üòç
