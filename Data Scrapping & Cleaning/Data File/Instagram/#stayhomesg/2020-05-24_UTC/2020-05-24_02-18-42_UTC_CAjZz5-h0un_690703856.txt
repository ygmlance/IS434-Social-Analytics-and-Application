Always remember WHY you took that first step and don’t be afraid of the PAST because it made you who you are TODAY☀️
.
Don’t let your past hold you back from moving towards who you want to become✌🏼
.
Have a STRONG WHY and take those SMALL STEPS because it’s a journey🙏🏼
.
It’s not about having a perfect body in eyes of others. It’s about having a mind and body that YOU are proud🙏🏼
.
You don’t need to have a perfect mind and body, be better than yourself yesterday with small steps. That’s all that matters💪🏼
