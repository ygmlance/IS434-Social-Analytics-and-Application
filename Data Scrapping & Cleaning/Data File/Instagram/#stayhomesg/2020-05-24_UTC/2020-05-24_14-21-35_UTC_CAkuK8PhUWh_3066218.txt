Eid this year is undoubtedly different from others. Felt a little emotional cause we could not see our family members, relatives and friends in person. Missed the handshakes, hugs and kisses and more. Definitely missed the haloo baloo of raya! I pray that we get out of this pandemic asap so we can all go back to our normal lives. Anyways, we made the best of Eid with zoom, we meet, we greet, we seek forgiveness, we laugh and joke too. In sya allah we will get to do so ‘live’ soon enough! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼💕💕🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 #stayhomesg #hariraya #selamathariraya2020 #eid2020 #syukurseadanya
