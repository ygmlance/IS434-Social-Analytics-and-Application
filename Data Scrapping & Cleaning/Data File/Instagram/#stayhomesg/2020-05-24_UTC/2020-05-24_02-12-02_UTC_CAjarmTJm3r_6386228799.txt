I havenâ€™t bought much online during this quarantine, but I got this screen glasses that supposedly block blue light that makes you tired, restless and gives you headaches. I am spending more time in front of the computer so I decided to get a pair. I am actually pleased to say that after a day in front of the laptop I donâ€™t feel as tired as I used to. Have you tried them? What has been your experience?
