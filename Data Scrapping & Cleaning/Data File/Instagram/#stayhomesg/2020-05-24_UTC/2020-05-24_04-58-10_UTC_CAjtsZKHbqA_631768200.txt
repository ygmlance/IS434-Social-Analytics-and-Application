Day 48 of Circuit breaker. 
Show your kindness and appreciation by making this cute healthy sandwich.

Joining this contest organised by friendsofgardenia 
I made a Flower sandwiches again inspired by this yellow flower which we are required to make using Gardenia wrappers but it is only for this 100% Wholemeal extra soft & fine bread.
My ingredients are very cheap & simple.
Tofu, tomatoes, carrots, broccoli. Chopped and mixed with two eggs. Add in seasoning. I used pepper, chilli powder & spicy sesame oil. 
Heat up the pan and made 2 omelettes.
Cut out 2 flower shape on the omelette.
Cut out 3 flower shape using 3 slices of bread.
1 piece has a heart shaped ( I don't have round one so used heart shaped) in between.
Stack them up with lettuce.
I brown the second slices of egg more because i want to make it look like the picture.
Used a edible food marker in yellow to draw the stripes.
Garnished with lettuces & tomatoes.
Served. 
You can add mayonnaise or any sauce in between but I want it to be healthy so i choose  not to. ðŸ˜Š
Thanks and be kind. ðŸ˜Š
