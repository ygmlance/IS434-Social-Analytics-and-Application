I made Mexican-style tacos tonight, with 4hr slow roasted pulled beef.

The benefit of roasting is that the whole place smells amazing for hours!

The “heaviness” of the jalapeño-spiked beef was nicely offset with a knob of burrata with olive oil and sea salt, plus a cold Corona🍺

Cheers to the long weekend and wishing you a Happy Eid if you celebrate it!
