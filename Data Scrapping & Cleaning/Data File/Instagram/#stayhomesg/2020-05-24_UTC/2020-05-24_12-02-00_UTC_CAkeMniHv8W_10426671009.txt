charcoal choux pastry from @matchayasg delivered by my friend ğŸ¤©ğŸ¤© tbh when they first came i didnt know what they were, but once i took a bite this rich creamy but surprisingly light filling just engulfed ma mouth. the charcoal lowkey tasted like oreos but less sweet. the matcha and hojicha taste was reaaally rich which i liked but the winner for me was black sesame ğŸ¤©ğŸ¤©ğŸ¤© it was so good i forgot to stop and take a pic. the filling was sweeter than the other 2 and paired really nicely with the pseudo-oreo crust ğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥º
