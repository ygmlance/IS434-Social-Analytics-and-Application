"I am thankful for the virtual programmes as they allow me to stay connected with SAMH Creative SAY! despite the COVID-19 situation. This is an artwork I have created. The process of creating this art piece brought me peace amidst the uncertainties that we are all living in now. Seeing other group members on-screen also gave me a sense of companionship and assured me that we are never alone." - Sheryl, Participant of Creative Therapeutic Group
