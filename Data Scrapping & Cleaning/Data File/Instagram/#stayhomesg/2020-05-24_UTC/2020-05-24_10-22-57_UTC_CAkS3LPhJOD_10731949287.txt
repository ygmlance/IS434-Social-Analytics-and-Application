Eid is different this year but thanks to zoom and Google meet, Shane and I managed to share some laughters and greetings with our families.

It’s the time to celebrate even if we are all at home.

We pray for you and your families’ to be in the state of healthfulness always, Ameen ameen.

We will be back to update on new @halalwithhew home-based merchants for you to order from this Raya soon!
