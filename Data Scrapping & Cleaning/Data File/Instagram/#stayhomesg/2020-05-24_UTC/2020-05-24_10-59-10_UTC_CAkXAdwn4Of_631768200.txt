Day 48 Circuit breaker dinner.
Cooked the same organic barley brown rice porridge. 
Tonights ingredients are all balanced ingredients that are needed to be cleared. 
Those broccoli,  carrots & sweet potatoes.
As i had gotten fresh one yesterday. 
Go with stirred fried cabbage.
Simple yet healthy. ðŸ™‚
