Tea time! ☕️Let's bask in the creamy deliciousness of this Basque Cheesecake 🍰.
.
Originating in Basque Country, Spain 🇪🇸, the cheesecake is hottest thing among cheesecake fans. I'm sure you have seen picts of "chao ta" (burnt) cheesecake shared by your friends right? No it's not a baking disaster, the top is burnt on purpose 😆.
.
The burnt top gives it a very slight bitter taste that balances out the sweet notes of the cake, and the cake itself remains soft and creamy, it's something that you have to try at least once 🤩.
.
@cakedwithlovesg got their Basque Cheesecake done nicely, it is freshly baked, hand-made with European ingredients and can be customised if you have any special preference 💛.
.
➡️Swipe to see the details on the cake, they retained the rustic look of the cake and topped it with fresh fruits dusted with edible gold dust. The cake was just the right kind of sweet, and the texture was a good balance between the New York cheesecake + Japanese cheesecake. I can easily have 2 slices in one sitting 🤤.
.
If you are celebrating a stayhome birthday 🎁 or just want to send a treat to your loved ones, they can arrange islandwide delivery at additional charge. The Basque Cheesecake is priced at $50 for 7-inch which is a good price! Besides the cheesecake, they have a variety of other bakes. Psst! Their chiffons are great for kids' parties, hit their IG to see the picts!.
