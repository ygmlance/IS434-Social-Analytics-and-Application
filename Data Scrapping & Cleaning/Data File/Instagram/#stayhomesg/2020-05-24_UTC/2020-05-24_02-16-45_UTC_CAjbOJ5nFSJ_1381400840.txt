Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri! This Hari Raya Puasa might be celebrated a little differently with circuit breaker measures in place, and gatherings with loved ones only possible through virtual calls. But while physically apart, may our hearts stay close. And the unconditional love and support of family and friends will see us through these times 💞⁣

Check out the beautiful 🌙⭐ decorations that brighten up the centre atrium of Gurney Plaza in Penang, Malaysia. At the mall, social distancing and strict precautionary measures are enforced as shoppers make a trip for their Ramadan essentials. For those of us in Singapore, we’ll just have to persevere a little longer; better days are ahead.⁣
⁣
Wishing all our Muslim friends a happy Ramadan. Stay safe, healthy and positive! 🕌☪⁣
