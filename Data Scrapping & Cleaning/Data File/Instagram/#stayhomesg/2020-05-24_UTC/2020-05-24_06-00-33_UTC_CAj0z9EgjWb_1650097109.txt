We want your drawings. Come create our collaborative artwork #mappingfear with us at mappingfear.com/submit⁠
⁠
@ohcy made this beautiful website that I hope can provide a peaceful space for reflection in these weird and uncertain times. All submissions are entirely anonymous. But you are more than welcome to tag yourself if your drawings pop up in the #mappingfear tag. ⁠
