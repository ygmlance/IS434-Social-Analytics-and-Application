Yes, the whole idea of distributing the funpacks to every household is very heart-warming. But it’s not pragmatic. Mass distribution of fun packs raises a double whammy — environment waste and economic waste. The money used to manufacture and distribute the fun packs should be re-allocated either back to our depleted reserves or distributed to those in need.

I would be a lot more proud to be a Singaporean if the funpack I opted out from helped a family trying to make ends meet, a recently out-of-work daily wage worker, a frontline healthcare nurse tending to the ill or a migrant worker forced to be quarantined in less-than-human living quarters. -
