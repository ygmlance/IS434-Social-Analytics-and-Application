Always had #fomo issues when I went to @mrspho so I hardly deviated from my TOP choice of Beef Pho. Mustered the courage to go beyond my fomo-ness and tried Mrs Pho Dry Noodles. 
Of course it didnâ€™t disappoint! I was really impressed with the generous portion of pork, meatball and spring roll. All of them were stars on their own, yet complimented each other really well too. #sgvietfood#sgeats#sgfood#sgfoodies#sgtakeout#stayhomesg#sgtabao#tabao#pho#vietnamesefoodsg#sgvietnamesefood
