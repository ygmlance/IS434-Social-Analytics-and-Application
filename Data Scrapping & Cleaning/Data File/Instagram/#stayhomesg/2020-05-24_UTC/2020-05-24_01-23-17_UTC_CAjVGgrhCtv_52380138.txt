Ramadhan was different this year..Syawal is different too..not only due to Covid-19, but also because this is our first time celebrating Eid without Arwah Abah. Could really feel the absence. 😔 May Allah places him in Jannah.
To all Muslims, Eid Mubarak! Selamat Hari Raya 'Aidilfitri! Minal 'aidil wal faizin. Maaf zahir dan batin.
