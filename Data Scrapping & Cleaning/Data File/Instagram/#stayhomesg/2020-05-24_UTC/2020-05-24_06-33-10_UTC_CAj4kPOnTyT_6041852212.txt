Did number bonding with my boy few days ago. Used anything that was readily available.

Did No. 7 with pom pom balls and No. 8 with his toy car and books. 
He has always been more comfortable with numbers than words so was easy to get him engaged in these exercises. 
Try this with your kids favourite items or tell a story saying that someone needs his help to split the things for 2 pax.
