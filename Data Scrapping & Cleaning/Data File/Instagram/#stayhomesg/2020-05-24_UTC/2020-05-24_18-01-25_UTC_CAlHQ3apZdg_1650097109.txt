My favourite part of this #mappingfear project is laying these drawings that participants have shared with me over each other. The areas that overlap suddenly become saturated with rich colours, and the areas that are different remain as they are. I think about these images as I read the fears that people write about. No matter how different we may seem in the bright light of day, so many of our fears are the same when it’s time to return to sleep. ⁠
