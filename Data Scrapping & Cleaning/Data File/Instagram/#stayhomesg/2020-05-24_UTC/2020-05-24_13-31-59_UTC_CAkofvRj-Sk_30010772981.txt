For students who are in Home-Based-Learning (HBL) due to Singapore’s Circuit Breaker, the birthday celebrations this year will be very different.

During this unusual time, we hope that the May HBL birthday boys and girls to stay safe, stay healthy and, most importantly, stay positive!

We are together with you! ❤️🇸🇬 #homebasedlearning
