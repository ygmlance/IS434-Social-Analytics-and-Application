Green Bag Obsession: Part 2 üíö
‚†Ä
This is my it bag for work and even leisure. Super roomy, sturdy and easy to match my clothings! Yes, if you are looking at getting a bag, I would recommend you to get this. It comes with 3 sizes, and many many colours.

Was shopping for a bag and the sales rep from DFS was superb attentive. She asked if I have any requirements for my bag. I told her what I would usually need to put in my bag, how I would like to carry it, the minimum maintenance I do for my bag, my budget, and given my built, I need a bag that's not too big. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
She asked some further questions like how I would usually dressed etc. Then, she suggested a few bags for me to choose, with all my requirements checked. She encouraged me to put my daily things in the bags, have a feel of what's like to own the bag to see if i like it. With her detail explanation and the try ons, I made my purchase on the spot. I am a happy customer.ü§ó
‚†Ä
She has guided me well on my purchase. The way she guided me through the whole purchase is pleasant. Being a sales practitioner, I am glad to be serviced attentively ü•∞‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Just like how I will understand my clients' lifestyles, goals, priorities, cashflow etc before asking for permission to do up a proposal. With proposals, I will share on the benefits and limitations of the proposals and how to use it. Discussion usually helps clients to make the right decision on what is more suitable for them. Like try on, client has a 14 days to reconfirm on their purchase. Of course, if the above was done right, client would be more than happy to make the purchase like how I am still very happy with my purchase from her.‚úåÔ∏è‚†Ä
