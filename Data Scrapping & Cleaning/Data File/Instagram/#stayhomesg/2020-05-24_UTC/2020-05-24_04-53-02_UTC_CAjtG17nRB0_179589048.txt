Covid home cooking part tres:
1) braised ee mee with clear-fridge ingredients (too salty)
2) @gordongram Carbonara (but I added too much cheese and didnt get the pasta to sauce ratio right)
3) shin ramen with @bibigo.official mandus. (my comfort food)
4) lor mee, with Mama Lee's ngor hiang, just cos the one at my place (old airport road) always have at least 30 pax in line (used the wrong type of black vinegar. A little too sweet).
Ceramic plates were made at @socasg. Can't wait to be back.
