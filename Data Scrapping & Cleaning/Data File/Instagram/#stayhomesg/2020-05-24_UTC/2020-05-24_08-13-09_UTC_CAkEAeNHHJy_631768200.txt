Day 48 Circuit breaker Sunday.
Sunday afternoon is the best time for a desserts like Sundae.
I won a $15 voucher on IG. Contest was organised by Swensen Singapore.
I ordered this Durian Supreme Sundae.
Only need to top up on the delivery for $1.86. Cool !
I love this flavour because firstly I love Durian,  secondly it has Attap Chee seed 亚哒子. Sorry. I don't know the English name on that.
I love ice cream with Attap Chee since childhood. 😁
This is so yummy!
Enjoying it on a Sunday with this cute Sundae Fuchiko & durian Sonny angel figurines which is even more cooler. 👍
Thanks @swensenssingapore for choosing me as one of the winners and organizing this contest. 😊
