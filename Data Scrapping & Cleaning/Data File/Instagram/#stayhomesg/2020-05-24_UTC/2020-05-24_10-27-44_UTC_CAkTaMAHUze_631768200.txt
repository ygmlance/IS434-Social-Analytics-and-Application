Day 48. Stirred fried cabbage with Tofu.
I seldom buy cabbage as the portion are usually big. It takes me many days to finished and end up being dried and brown.
I saw this kind of cabbages yesterday which is slightly bigger than my palm size.
So cute.
I peeled off 3 big leaves and chopped it up and  add Tofu. Stirred fried.
Very simple and easy. Healthy too.
