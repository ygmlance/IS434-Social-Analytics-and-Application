Highlight of the week: New Vacuum! 
It sucks. 🧹

This is how I know I’m over 30. My online shopping has consisted of this, large ice cube trays for oversized ice for my g&t’s and one gigantic fringe coat which makes me look like a fraggle. Oh and a lot of kids workbooks, pencils, and wide ruled paper. What have you been clicking “add to cart” on? .

Ps. I’ve been mouthing “I want to vacuum” a lot at my husband recently. 😉 he doesn’t find it as funny as I do. 🤷🏼‍♀️
