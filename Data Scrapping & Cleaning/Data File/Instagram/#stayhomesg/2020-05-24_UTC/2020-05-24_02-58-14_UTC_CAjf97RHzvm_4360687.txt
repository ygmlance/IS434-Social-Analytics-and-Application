Sweet, sweet weekend filled with treats! Hereâ€™s the traditional #chendol from @OldAmoyChendol, new generation hawker preserving his grandfatherâ€™s original recipe with artisanal touches such as Japanese adzuki beans, cold-pressed coconut milk, patiently handmade green â€˜wormsâ€™, and gula melaka specially sourced from Sarawak. The taste is pure and rich, without being overly sweet or cloying. They are also doing deliveries right now - WhatsApp your orders to 8748 7590. ðŸ¥°
