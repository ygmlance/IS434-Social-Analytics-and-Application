#stayhomesg ‘Your hands have made me and fashioned me, An intricate unity; Yet You would destroy me. Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again? Did You not pour me out like milk, And curdle me like cheese, Clothe me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews? You have granted me life and favor, And Your care has preserved my spirit. ‘And these things You have hidden in Your heart; I know that this was with You: If I sin, then You mark me, And will not acquit me of my iniquity. If I am wicked, woe to me; Even if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head. I  am full of disgrace; See my misery! If my  head is exalted, You hunt me like a fierce lion, And again You show Yourself awesome against me. You renew Your witnesses against me, And increase Your indignation toward me; Changes and war are ever with me.
Job 10:8‭-‬17 NKJV
