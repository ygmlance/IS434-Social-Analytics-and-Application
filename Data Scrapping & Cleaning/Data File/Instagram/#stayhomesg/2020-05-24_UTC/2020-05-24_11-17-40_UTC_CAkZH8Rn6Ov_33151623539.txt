Eating when one is not hungry and only half hungry is harmful, especially for those who have indigestion.

It is desirable to take food when the main flow of breath is through right nostril, because that is the time when the digestive glands start secreting a sufficient quantity of fluids to help digestion.

Fill your stomach halfway with food, 1/4 with water, and 1/4 empty for free movement! - P.R Sarkar
