Some of you may have asked, ‘what are Blondies?’ Here’s introducing to you a brand new character... Mr. Bond!

A blondie (or blonde brownie) is a rich, sweet butterscotch-flavoured dessert bar. It resembles the traditional chocolate brownie, 🍫but contains vanilla instead of cocoa used in brownies, and contains brown sugar 🧂. We’ve also been tweaking our Blondies recipe recently so please try our new and improved Blondies too!

Bringing to you exciting news.. ✨We’ll be starting a collaboration with @doodle_idol a talented artist who is behind all the cute drawings you see here. Do check their page out! Continue to watch 👀 this space as we bring you more stories and adventures of little brownie and friends!
