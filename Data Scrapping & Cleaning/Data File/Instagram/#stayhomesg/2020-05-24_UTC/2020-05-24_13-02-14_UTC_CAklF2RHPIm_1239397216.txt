Staying in may be our new normal, but it's more important than ever to prioritise self-care 💆🏻 When every day is a blur of working from home, household upkeep and family time, it's easy to overlook your well-being. So whether it's baking up a storm, whipping up some Dalgona coffee or a binge sesh of your fave Netflix series, remember to pencil in a little TLC 🥰 ⁠
