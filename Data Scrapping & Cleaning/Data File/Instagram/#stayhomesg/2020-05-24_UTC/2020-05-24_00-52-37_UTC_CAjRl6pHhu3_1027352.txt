As though art directed purely for aesthetic reasons, the “Omega Bakudan Don” ($130) from @kishosg is an undeniably pretty palette of #PantoneColors. Yet, it is on the palate where it casually flexes its prowess as a masterpiece.
@Chef_Kazu_Hamamoto first lays a base with duo of rice before going over it with thick “colour blocks” of different seafood that manages to evoke a gradient effect since it begins with the pale pink, fat-laced Wild-caught Blue Fin #Otoro and segues into the light, creamy ochre of Hokkaido Bafun #Uni before deepening to a luminous orange, that of housemade Shoyu #Ikura and Chef’s own marinated organic egg yolk. The final two are almost a perfect match in vividness.
Should you desire to partake in this precise artform where the ocean’s raw talent is presented by Chef Kazu in a deconstructed yet graphic style, look no further. Tap on @kishosg’s link in bio now.
