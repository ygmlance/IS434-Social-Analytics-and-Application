Breaking Circuit 48...
Home is where the 💞 are. Go over the bridge. At the 🏰 of Shrek turn left. Gates are about to appear. Go through them on to the other side where winding roads are waiting through lush fairy greeneries with cascading orchids to guide you home. This home is always safe.
Now it's just a bit safer...
