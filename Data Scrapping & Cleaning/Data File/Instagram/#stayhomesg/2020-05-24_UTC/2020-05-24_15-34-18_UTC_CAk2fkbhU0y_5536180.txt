Despite the fact that we are not able to visit our families this Syawal, our raya spirit is still high and we dressed up for zoom raya with our loved ones.

We ate, joke, laughed, and cried. Just like the first day of Syawal.

We also took pictures / screenshots to remember the year we all stayed home for raya.

Selamat hari raya from our little family! @ohmyfad
