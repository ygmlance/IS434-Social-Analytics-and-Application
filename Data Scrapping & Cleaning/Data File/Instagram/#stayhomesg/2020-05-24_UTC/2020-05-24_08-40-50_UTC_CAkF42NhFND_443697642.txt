We thought making a family cover is impossible but indeed COVID19 has proven wrong! A blessing in disguise. Ma Shaa Allah. Love to see their happy faces üòç Good job to both my parents for retaking a lot of times and be sportive! Thumbs up to Ayah for choosing this song. We hope you guys enjoy this short clip from us.
