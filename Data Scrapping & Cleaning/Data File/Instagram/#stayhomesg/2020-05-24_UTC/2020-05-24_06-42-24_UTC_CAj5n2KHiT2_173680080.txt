2-Aglio Olio with Prawn-Comes with 5 large prawn grilled to perfection. The aglio e olio is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Naples. The dish is made by lightly sauteeing sliced, minced, or pressed garlic in olive oil, sometimes with the addition of dried red chili flakes, and tossing with spaghetti.

3-Tortellini with Truffle Sauce and Mushrooms- Tortellini are ring-shaped pasta originally from the Italian region of Emilia. They are sometimes also described as "navel shaped", hence their alternative name of "belly button", and bear a strong resemblance to a large wonton. Here in this dish the tortellini are buried in sea of mushrooms with truffle sauce.
