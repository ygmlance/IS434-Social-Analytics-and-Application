Although afternoon tea isnâ€™t really my thing, I do admit I miss having it once in awhile especially during this current pandemic situation.

My last afternoon tea was at @interconsin and I heard that their Classic Afternoon Tea is now available for takeaway or delivery. The set for two includes a variety of sweets, savouries and their signature loose-leaf tea blend.
