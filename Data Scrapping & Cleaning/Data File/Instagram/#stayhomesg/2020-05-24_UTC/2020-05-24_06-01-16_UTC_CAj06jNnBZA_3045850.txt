I used to suffer from eczema and my skin was combination of oily/dry it was very tough for me to find a suitable product in the market which target my skin concerns yet not being too strong as my skin is really sensitive at the same time.⁣
⁣
I wore thick foundation to conceal my skin concerns which worsen my skin condition in a long run. ⁣
⁣
Lucky me, I came across geoskincare, a year ago, not only it helps me with all my skin concerns, it’s also very mild and gentle on my sensitive skin.⁣

Pm me now to achieve glowing healthy skin ✨
