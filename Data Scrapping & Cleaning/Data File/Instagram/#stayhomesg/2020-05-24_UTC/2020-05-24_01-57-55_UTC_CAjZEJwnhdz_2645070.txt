Kids are looking forward to school but I’m like only 60% because HOW to make them put on their mask properly like for hours in school? 📝🖍📕 So these days I’ve been “nagging” at them about the importance of keeping their mask on them during school hours ✨✨✨ #worrymum ⁣

New Camo 🌟 Dress from @tracyeinny is my all time favorite. Guess you peek into my collections in my previous post 🤣 Together, they are launching the NEW Camo masks in both kids and adults size selling at $5.90 nett. Mega ❤️ to the material and cutting of this stylish mask 👍🏻💯✨ ⁣
