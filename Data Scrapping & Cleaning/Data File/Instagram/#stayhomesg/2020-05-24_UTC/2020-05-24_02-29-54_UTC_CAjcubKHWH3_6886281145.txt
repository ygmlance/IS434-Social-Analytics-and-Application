Little Manâ€™s really been into Geography lately. All thanks to papa whoâ€™s been fuelling it with map posters and flag drawings. Mama helped by buying world map puzzles!

This little corner seems to be permanent in his room for now. It sparks so much self-directed learning, independent playing and many interesting conversations.

Hereâ€™s to hoping this lasts! Itâ€™s been fun learning about the world together with him. Mamaâ€™s bad with history/geography/social studies ðŸ˜‚
