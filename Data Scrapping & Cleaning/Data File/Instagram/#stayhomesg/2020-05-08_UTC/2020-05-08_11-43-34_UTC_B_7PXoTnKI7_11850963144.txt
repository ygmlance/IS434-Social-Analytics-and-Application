Kimchi pancake!!! 😍 Second attempt of the week with some tweaks to the recipe. Super crispy and savoury yums! 😋 I sliced them up and ate them like mini pizzas 🍕😂 If you’re craving it, the good news is you can make this easily at home 😊👇🏻

RECIPE: (1) Mix the following well together - 1/2 cup kimchi (scoop some of its juice too) + 1/2 cup plain flour + slightly less than 1/2 cup potato starch + 1/2 teaspoon salt + 5 tablespoon water + chopped scallion (as much as you love!). (2) Pour the mixture into a heated pan containing 4 tablespoon of oil. (3) Fry on medium-high heat and flip the pancake when around 75% of the bottom is done. (4) Add another 1 tablespoon of oil around the edges of the pan. (5) Repeat flipping until both sides are crisp. ⭐️ Tip: Make sure your mixture isn’t too thick and is evenly spread out on the pan, and use a spatula to press down all parts of the pancake a few times when frying.
