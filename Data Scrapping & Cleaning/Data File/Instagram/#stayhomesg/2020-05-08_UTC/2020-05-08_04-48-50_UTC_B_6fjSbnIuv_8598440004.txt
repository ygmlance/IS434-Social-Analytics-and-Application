â€œThis stroller left me speechless! It surprised me with how lightweight it is, compared to everything it offers. With boys growing up, we needed to switch up our stroller too. Nuna Triv convinced me with its simplicity and size, but still featuring everything a bigger stroller would - big basket, extendable handle, pockets and compatibility with infant car seat. See in the video how excited we were unboxing it!" Credit: @dearkitchen thanks for sharing this cute unboxing video with us ðŸ’•
