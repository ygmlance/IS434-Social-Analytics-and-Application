As we spend more time at home during the covid-19 #circuitbreaker period, I spend a few moments for mediation.

Fear and anxiety are riding high on our emotional scales at the moment. A few moments in the day where you can turn inward, tap into your gratitude bank and remind yourself that you can be at peace and think good  regardless of the situation.

1: Understand your pain
2: Lower your stress
3: Connect better
4: Improve focus
5: Reduce brain chatter

This will seem ridiculously easy, to just meditate for two minutes. That’s perfect. Start with just two minutes a day for a week.

I will meditate every day

𝐃𝐨𝐧’𝐭 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐮𝐩 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐨𝐰
Just DO. Start just by sitting on a chair, or on your couch. Or on your bed. If you’re comfortable on the ground, sit cross-legged.

𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤 𝐢𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐲𝐨𝐮’𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠. As you first settle into your meditation session, simply check to see how you’re feeling. How does your body feel? What is the quality of your mind? Busy? Tired? Anxious?
