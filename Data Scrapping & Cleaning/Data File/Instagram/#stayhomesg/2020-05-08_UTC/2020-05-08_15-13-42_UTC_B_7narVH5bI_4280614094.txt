CB day ??? 👨🏻‍💻: What’s for dinner? 👩🏻‍🍳 : The plan is 1 meat + rice veg with rice but I’m feeling tired. Thinking of a one pot meal and try making Mee Hoon Kueh. Just be prepared to dabao if it fails!

After an 1hr+ of prepping the ingredients, rolling the dough and looking at Miss Tam Chiak’s recipe... 👨🏻‍💻 *pinch the dough into pieces and throws into boiling water*
Looks like Mee Hoon Kueh. Taste like it too. Let’s eat!
