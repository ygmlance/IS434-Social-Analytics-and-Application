Day 32 Circuit breaker dinner.
Initially i wanted to cook instant noodles after seeing it on IG. 
Very common on IG during Circuit breaker.
However i decided not too after much consideration. I had too much carbs today and in less than one month during the CB period i had 6 packets.
In May i have not started. 😊 I have 出前一丁in bowl & packets type. Yes. I love Nissin one.
I cooked this omelette with Lup cheong, mushroom & tomatoes.
Eat with Hay bee hiam not bad sia.😁
Another easy breezy meal.😊 #jasmine_homecooked #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithst
