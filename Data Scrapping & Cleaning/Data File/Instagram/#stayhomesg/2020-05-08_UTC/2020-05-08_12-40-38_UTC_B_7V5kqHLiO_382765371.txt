With the circuit breaker measures in place, the rare occasions when I can flaunt my new ðŸŽ’ , ðŸ‘ and ðŸ‘— are either when I go for my gynae visits or here on social media. ðŸ˜…

Do you all like my new bag from @gastonluga ? I fell in love with it immediately when I opened the box as the pink colour is just so sweet!

Gaston Luga hails from Stockholm, Sweden, and its bags are designed for everyday use. This stylish bag that I am holding (CLÃ„SSY - BLACK & PINK) can easily fit a laptop and other barang barangs that you may have, making it perfect for travelling/schooling days.

Good news! You can enjoy 15% off all items storewide on www.gastonluga.com with my discount code "TinaJamie15". There will be free home delivery and returns too. Awesome!

Can't wait to head out with it when CB ends! ðŸ˜‰
