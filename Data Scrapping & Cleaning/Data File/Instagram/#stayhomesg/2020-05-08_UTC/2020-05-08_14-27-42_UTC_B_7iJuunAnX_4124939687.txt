♡Fried Nian Gao Spring Rolls♡
I love Nian Gao and usually my mum will coat it with egg flour and deep fry it! This was from cny period that she pass it to me but was procastinating because I have to deep-fry it. So I reckon that I could air-fry it instead! 👍🏻😋 Cut the Nian Gao & Sweet Potato into long strips. Steam the sweet potato until soft.
 Wrapped it together with sweet potato in spring roll skin, egg brush and goes in the airfryer!

 I couldn't finish all at once so I freeze them and air-fry whenever I need a sweet snack! .
