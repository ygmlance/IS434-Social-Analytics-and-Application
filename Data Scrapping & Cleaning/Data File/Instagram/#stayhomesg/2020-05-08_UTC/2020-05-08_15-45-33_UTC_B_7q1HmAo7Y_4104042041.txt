Lightning is a form of electrical discharge. Heavily charged clouds induces charges on the ground and creates high potential difference between the clouds and the ground. Lightning occurs as a means to bring that potential difference back to equilibrium. Air molecules are ionized and this allows electrons to conduct a lot more quickly through the air, creating lightning. Electrons travel down (or up!) in attempts to neutralise that potential difference. Notice that the word discharge is the opposite of charge. ðŸŽ¥: @esdoublelef
