#CBpantry: Had a super satisfying iftar last night! Cooked a favourite dish which I haven't done in a while - Cajun Jambalaya. This was the first dish I learnt to make from scratch and kicked off my #noobcook shenanigans. Also, managed to grab a Koi bubble tea order from Grain. All is right with the world again! ü§§ ü•∞

Thanks, @graincomsg and @koithesingapore for my bbt fix. You have no idea how much I needed it! ‚ù§Ô∏è #homecook #jambalaya #CajunCooking #bubbletea #instafood #foodgram #foodporn #yummy #CircuitBreaker2020 #COVID19 #StayHome #StayHomeSG #sgig #igsg
