ðŸš¨SMALL BATCH SPECIAL

The best JamÃ³n in the world comes from Huelva, Spain. In the past few months, itâ€™s been tough for the producers in the region with the drop in demand for their product due to the uncertainties around the covid situation.

To help these farms out, weâ€™ve decided to bring in a small batch of equally awesome IbÃ©rico JamÃ³n de Bellota and IbÃ©rico Paleta de Bellota. These are black label only - meaning 100% IbÃ©rico and 100% acorn fed.

We even did a blind taste test with our existing product and couldnâ€™t tell the difference.

DM us to place your orders. Weâ€™ll start shipping 12 May onwards
