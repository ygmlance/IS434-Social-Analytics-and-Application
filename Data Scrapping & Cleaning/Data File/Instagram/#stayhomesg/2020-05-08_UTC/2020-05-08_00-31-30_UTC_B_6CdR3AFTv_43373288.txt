In our third Shentonista Mothers feature, learn more about Sherlin and her (mis)adventures as she navigates her day with Samara and Shiraz by her side. Whether it’s the impossible task of choosing a lunch menu for the day, binge-watching an entire series with her daughter, or bonding over a comprehension passage with her son, it’s all about being on the ball, and taking each day’s challenges as they come.
