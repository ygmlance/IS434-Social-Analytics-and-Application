Cannot BELIEVE how fantastic this fresh pizza base is - crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside - and it's done in a frypan, NO oven required.

The boys did the @cookyn.inc Junior Lifeskills Online Camp 🍕, and were kept occupied kneading dough, chopping ingredients, and cooking. I was impressed the kids could do almost everything with zero help.

My mind is boggled that this pizza dough doesn’t need yeast or an oven.. just simple ingredients and it’s super quick too. Great to whip together a quick meal.

I can’t get over how good it tastes! We were so overjoyed. Guess what we’ll be making every week from now on 😅
