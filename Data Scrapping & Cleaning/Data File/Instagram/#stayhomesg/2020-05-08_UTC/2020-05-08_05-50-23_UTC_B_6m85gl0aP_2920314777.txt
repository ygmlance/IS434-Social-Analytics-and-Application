#stayhomesg: Drinking Cinderella's carriage  Soup...
So easy to get pumpkin nowadays, so instead of making pumpkin Kaya (which I wouldnt be able to finish by myself), I make a thick vegan pumpkin soup (adding carrot and potatoes). No fixed rules, any combinations!

My first encounter with Vegetarian  pumpkin soup was in NZ during early spring a quarter of a century ago,  it tasted so good, a bowl of piping hot soup in a cold weather and was Vegetarian.
