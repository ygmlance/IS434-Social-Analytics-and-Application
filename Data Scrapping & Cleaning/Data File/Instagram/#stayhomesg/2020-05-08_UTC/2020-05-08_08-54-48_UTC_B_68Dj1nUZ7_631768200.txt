Day 32 Tea time snacks.
My homemade sweet potatoes desserts and my complimentary fish ball crackers from my IG friend Kerene on Sunday. Today then i open ceremony. Too much tibits to snacks.😁
I was looking for my bread mould but i can't find  instead i found heart shaped spoons & bowl huggers.
I love heart shaped and have kept this for so many years. Now i realise i am such a Garang guni or gian png. Metal heart is s free gift from Meiji collagen powder and the two plastics ones are frozen yogurt Yu Li Pao Pao ( already closed down, at OC ).
But they were cute right? I so can't bear to throw away.😁 Not easy to find heart shape spoons.
The hello kitty & Mina Tabo bowl huggers were from Kellogg's cereal. Yes free gifts since 2009. They fits better on bowl.😁 #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithst
