Day 32 Circuit breaker.
Fuchiko Friday.
Play with my new toy.
I don't have milk & butter & i shouldn't used two eggs . The pancake the colour is not nice & too yellow.
I love this toy. I never made pan cake in a nice heart shaped before.ðŸ˜Š #jasmine_homecooked #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithst
