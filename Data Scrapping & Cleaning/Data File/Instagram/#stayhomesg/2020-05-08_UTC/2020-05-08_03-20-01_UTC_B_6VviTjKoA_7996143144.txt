Our featured dish of the week: Gamja tang (Traditional Pork Bone Soup)! ðŸ¥˜ -

Gamjatang is soup made with pork neck bones and vegetables. Sizzling hot gamjatang is hearty and savory which makes it always popular at the dinner table. The soft fatty meat picked from the gaps between the bones is especially tasty. The fully cooked cabbage and bean sprouts in the stock turn soft yet retain a crispy texture. Gamjatang makes a perfect nutrients packed, satisfying meal when paired with a bowl of rice. -
