[ Advance Abs Workout ]
.
This exercise would be more of an advance level of abs exercises. You would need to have abs to flex and twist.. that’s why it’s called advance. 😅 Even with a little bit of abs, you can do this. Flex and twist from side to side. It will help to further enhance the definition of your abs and oblique sides of it. Targeting it all! ✊🏼
.
You can do as many reps as you want till you’re tired.
