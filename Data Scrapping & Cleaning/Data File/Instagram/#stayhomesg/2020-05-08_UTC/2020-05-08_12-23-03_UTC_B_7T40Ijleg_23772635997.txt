Lockdown update: Had fun baking with this little one today! Then we decided to recreate a cute @masterclass ad because this picture reminded me of all those ads I keep seeing. Honestly, they are so entertaining to watch! And I don't feel as guilty because I walk away feeling like I've learnt something. I don't get the guilty feeling that I am just "wasting time". Especially, since we (mums) are always hard pressed for time. .
