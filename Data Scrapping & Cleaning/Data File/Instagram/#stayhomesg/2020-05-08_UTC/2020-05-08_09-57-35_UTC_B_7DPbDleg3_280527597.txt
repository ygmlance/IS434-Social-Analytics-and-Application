When we crave for human connection, our friends and loved ones are now just a video call away, thanks to tech. What do we do then if we crave for our favourite but inaccessible nibbles and snacks during the circuit breaker period? We try to make them or simply find better alternatives! üçé

Known for eating healthy in the office, Trybe Youth Worker Marcus, Senior Social Worker Esther, and Strategy & Development Head Vimel want to share their go-to snacks, nibbles and meals to satisfy their cravings during this period. #FitnessFriday .

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do indulge in fried chicken, chips, and ice cream from time to time. While I do on most days eat healthily, a lot of what I‚Äôve been eating these days have also to do with being pregnant and making sure that the food I eat is nutritious. - Esther .

My go-to snacks are fruits! They‚Äôre easily accessible, affordable, and healthy. When I‚Äôm craving for something sweet after working out, I eat bananas. Apples for when I want something crunchy. Oranges when I want something citrusy.
‚Äì Marcus .

I like snacking on fruits because they keep me full and satisfied when I crave for something sweet. Occasionally, I would throw in avocadoes into the mix. They‚Äôre tasteless so I pair them with strong-flavoured fruits like soursop and add in some honey. When I feel like having some chips, I go with cheese and cream crackers. They are not the healthiest, but they‚Äôre good substitute for chips. - Vimel
