I find knitting clothes for my little knitted ones challenging. Maybe it’s time I do a swatch before I knit.
...
For this “camisole” originally planned for Mrs Ngeow, I used the agar-agar method of swatching. Of course it ended up ill fitting. Boy-boy was asked to try it. He wasn’t very happy about it. Grace said she’s happy to wear it but she has so many outfits already.

So, who wore it best?
