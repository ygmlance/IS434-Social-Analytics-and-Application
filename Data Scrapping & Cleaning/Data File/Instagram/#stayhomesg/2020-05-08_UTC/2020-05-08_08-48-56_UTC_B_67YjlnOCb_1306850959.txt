❤️The best day is...today!❤️ Attended a mental health talk organized by company today and had some great takeaways! Firstly, do give yourself mental breaks while wfh! Secondly, self-care is important and that includes saying “no”to unreasonable demands (from work). Finally, instead of striving for perfection, let’s strive for excellence! It’s never possible to perfectly juggle between work and home during this CB period so it is good enough to do a good job. Cut yourself some slack! 🤣 Hope these mental health tips help! 🤗 Anyway, today I had a heavy brunch, which my friend said resembles a kids meal. 🤣 Campbell canned mushroom soup with hard boiled eggs, plain Meiji crackers with margarine and green tea milk spread dips and a huge 🍓. This Osulloc green tea milk spread is extremely yummy and a popular gift to get from Seoul directly. However, it is quite expensive at $16.95 from Cold Storage. Nevertheless, definitely worth it if you love green tea spread on your pastries! Oh, and I’m pairing today’s brunch with Starbucks 3-in-1 mocha!  What a feast on Friday! TGIF everyone! 🤩🤩🤩
