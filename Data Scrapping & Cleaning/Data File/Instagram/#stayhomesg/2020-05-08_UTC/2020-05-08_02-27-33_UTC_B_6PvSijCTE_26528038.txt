Ok so maybe these are my “what I wish I could wear” but in the end I did find a comfy yet glam look for house-lounging. All the camis in this video are from the new Singapore label @storiesofsaturday . The line features an array of silk and satin camis that are the base for these great looks. The materials are perfect for this hot humid weather and are also perfect for layering up as big and bold as you like with prints and jewels. Or you can keep them clean and minimalistic.... but when have I ever done anything not to the max 😅. Check them out and show them some love!
