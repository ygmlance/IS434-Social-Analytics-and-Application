Having been floored by @allium.sg’s Choux Buns last week, ordering them again was a foregone conclusion. For this week’s filling, Pastry Chef @lusianadarusman created a heavenly blend of Kaya and Gula Aren in Vanilla Cream. Smooth, heavy and voluptuous, it was dazzlingly in fragrance and flavour as the sweetness from the Indonesian palm sugar was of an earthy-rich nature. To me, this filling bears a striking resemblance in taste to a most excellent #Chendol.
