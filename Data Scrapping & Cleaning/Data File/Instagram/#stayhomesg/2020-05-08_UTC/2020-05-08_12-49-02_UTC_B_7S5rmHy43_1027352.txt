Just so you know, @shangrilasg has already sold out their Motherâ€™s Day Specials like I knew they would once I saw the menu. Designed for families of different size, the sets were smartly curated combos with dishes that would sit well with many. Take the one I received as a gift from @somikban, Executive Assistant Manager of F&B at the hotel. It included a D.I.Y. #Popiah Kit (always a hit because itâ€™s food and fun rolled into one), Roasted Duck from @shangpalacesg (very juicy and tasty this was), a brilliant #ChilliCrab with dream-come-true de-shelled claws and chunks of peeled crab meat swimming in the spicy-tangy sauce, a decent Nonya Chap Chye, two big portions of eggy Fried Rice with Char Siew and Prawns. As for the more sinful items, there was a serving of crunchy Cereal Prawns, Deepfried Bakwan Kepiting (a smart alternative to the classic soup, I thought) and Chicken Ngoh Hiang (they were tasty and not at all dry which some tend to be). Not one but two desserts rounded off our meal. The Black Glutinous Porridge was the Asian representative and it was fine but I adored the airy-light White Peach Sakura #Cake with Mascarpone Mousse and Lime Sponge much more.

However, letâ€™s not forget that the hotel is offering 20% OFF the a la carte takeaway menus from their F&B establishments of #shangpalacesg, #WaterfallRistoranteItaliano and The Line Buffet Restaurant for Cantonese, Italian and International fare respectively. You can order online (link in @shangrilasgâ€™s bio) or call up 6213 4398, and collect your meals directly at the hotel's driveway, without having to leave your vehicle. How convenient is that ðŸ˜Š. #veronicaphuaeats #shangrilasg #shangrilasingapore #mothersday2020 #singaporerestaurants #burpproved #burppletastemaker #burpple #burpplesg #sgfoodies #igfood #igfoodie #instaeat #foodiesofinstagram #foodlover #foodstagram #foodie #foodspotting #tastespotting #foodporn #comfortfood #singapore #stayhomesg #loveyourlocalsg
