Unhappy with big bro for snitching on food, while he obediently tried to stay nice for pictures. Thatâ€™s our feast with @8crabs earlier this week.

Fresh and meaty black pepper and chilli crabs, along with hor fun, mee goreng and prawn paste chicken for dinner. Not forgetting the buns when eating chilli crab. And we love that the chilli crab came with a generous amount of gravy. Weâ€™ve got our gastronomic review all up on blog. Link in profile.

Motherâ€™s Day is this Sunday, the best day for Mums and kitchen to stay independently apart. Youâ€™ve a food delivery option added to your list now ðŸ˜‰ .
