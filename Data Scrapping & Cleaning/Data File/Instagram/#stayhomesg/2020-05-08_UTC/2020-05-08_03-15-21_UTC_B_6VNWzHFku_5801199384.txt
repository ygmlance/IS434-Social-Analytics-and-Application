Virtual Lesson in Progress. What do you plan besides cooking and baking after 30 days of circuit breaker? I have been cooking and cooking and cooking. Recently I just learn how to some essential food that I can make for breakfast but i find it not as manageable as baking clay. 
Now it’s time to settle down and doing some thing I love since it’s the start of school holidays. How about learning some new crafts at home with your family together? Check our website for new Virtual lessons !
