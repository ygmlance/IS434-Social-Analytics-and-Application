ðŸŒ¼Hi everyone ðŸŒ¼

Thanks to your support, we have raised a total of $10,490 for Transient Workers Count Too (@twc2sg). I would like to sincerely thank everyone for supporting this campaign and making it a success. This campaign may have ended but the conversations about migrant worker welfare had just begun. Letâ€™s treat our migrant friends better and letâ€™s continue to spread the love ðŸŒ¼

Love,
Sugarfreesaccharin .
