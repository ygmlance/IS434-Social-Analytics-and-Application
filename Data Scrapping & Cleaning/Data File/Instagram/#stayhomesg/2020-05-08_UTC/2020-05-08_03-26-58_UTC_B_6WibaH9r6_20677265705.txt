Hey all itâ€™s Friday! ðŸ‘‹ I hope you guys are doing good. I know it doesnâ€™t feel like a Friday as, during this weird period, our schedule and internal body clock are all over the place. That doesnâ€™t mean you should neglect your daily skincare routine. 
We help you a lil bit in this beautiful mess to get your skin back to good health. ðŸ’ª

1. Get your cleanser & toner ready. These two are the staple skincare duo to tide you over this stay home period. We recommend W3 Cleanser & Toner. 
2. A serum to fight the first signs of dark spot caused by the sun. A few key ingredients you might want to look for Alpha Arbutin, Licorice, Complex Vit-C. We have Lingzhi Skin Repair Serum with us.

3. Also, the moisturiser. To banish active pigmentation but also to fill the skin with antioxidants. We recommend W3 white focus concentrate.

4. Lastly, the sunblock. A skincare routine isnâ€™t a routine without a sunblock. It is one of the most important protection for anti-wrinkle, anti-dark spots, and anti-sagging. We recommend you the Smart Tone Color Control SPF 30.

To place your order for these products, just drop us a message or connect with us thru W/A @ +65 8838 4882 today! 
Happy Friday all! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
