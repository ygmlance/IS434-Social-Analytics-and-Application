Imagine chicken with super crispy skin that is in a pot of thick flavour-bursting gravy with lots of carrots, celery, onions, potatoes and a sprinkle of black pepper, rosemary and thyme for that extra flavour! We call it the happy celebratory dish at home, cos it only makes its appearance together with wine when we have something to celebrate in the family!  Also I can\u2019t wait to go back to my parent\u2019s place after CB ends for my home cooked bday dinner celebration! \ud83d\ude00 \ud83d\ude1b  @coff_n_choc @claudio.chock @djblaqjacq",
