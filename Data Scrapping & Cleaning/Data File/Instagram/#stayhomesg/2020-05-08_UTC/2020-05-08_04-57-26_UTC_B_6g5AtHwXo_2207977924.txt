Love. These. Pancakes!

The easy recipe from @haruplate was a hit for both of us! I got a little impatient waiting for the batter to flat out on its own so I lent a hand (or two), hence the ugliness. ðŸ˜‚

The batch makes 20 small pancakes (one pancake is about 1/8 cup of batter). I froze the excess and air fry them at 120Â°C for 3 minutes (another tip from @haruplate). Canâ€™t wait for the next session!
