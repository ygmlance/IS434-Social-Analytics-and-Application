Imma on a roll here, literally. Made these yesterday, was meaning to share it earlier but at First I wasn‚Äôt too blown away the taste, I felt the filling was too salty. But then it cooled down and I had another one this morning and somehow it really tasted better. Lol am I overthinking? ‚Å£‚Å£

Been feeling like bread is becoming my thing (is that even such a thing?), enjoying every part of the kneading process. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ ‚Å£‚Å£

As usual, link of recipe I followed on my stories/highlights. I seem to be liking editing these videos a little too much too üôà. ‚Å£‚Å£
