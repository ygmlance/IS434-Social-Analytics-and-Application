We celebrate the holy month of Ramadan together with our 30 Years Anniversary. This yearâ€™s Ramadan will continue to be Special despite the COVID-19 situation.

On behalf of everyone from Team Sumo Firenza, we would like to thank all our Muslim families & friends who have supported us throughout these years. 
May we continue to share the spirit of togetherness, being socially responsible and staying home for our safety. The spirit of Ramadan remain in our hearts and light up our souls from within. 
We will continue to do our part in ensuring best care specially those in need. Also, our heartfelt appreciation to the global healthcare workers & front-liners protecting us from the virus.

Have a blessed Ramadan Kareem.
