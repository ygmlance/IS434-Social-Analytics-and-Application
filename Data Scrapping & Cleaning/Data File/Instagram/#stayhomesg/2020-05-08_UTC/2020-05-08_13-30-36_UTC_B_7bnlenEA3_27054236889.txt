It's mango time ðŸ¥­ Here are our two new fav mango #gintonic 
First up - Mango Black Pepper G&T. Idea borrowed from the guy sitting on the table next to me in a #Sydney bar, eons ago. He ordered a good 'ol ginto, threw in some black pepper & voila ~~ Hello flavour ðŸ’¥
Next to it is - Mango Chilli G&T. Inspired by the raw mango and chillli-salt street snack I first had in #bangkok ðŸ’£ 
Up your ginto game today ðŸ’¯
Shake it - make it - and tag us
