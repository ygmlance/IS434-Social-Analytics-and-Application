It's Friday, and since we can’t visit any of our favourite bars, we’ll be shaking up a Sydney Sling, the signature cocktail from The Fullerton Hotel Sydney.

Sweet, but with a touch spice, this cocktail is the ultimate happy hour tipple. The Sydney Sling is a nod to The Fullerton Hotels and Resorts Singaporean roots, featuring the signature Singapore Sling cocktail – the Sydney Sling is local version of the Singaporean classic.

Ingredients:
45ml gin -The Fullerton Hotel Sydney uses Four Pillars 58.8 Gin
45ml blood orange juice - grapefruit juice is a great substitute
15ml hibiscus liqueur - elderflower Liqueur is a great substitute
10ml ginger liqueur - alternatively, double up on ginger juice
25ml fresh lime juice
10ml fresh ginger juice
10ml Grenadine
20ml sugar syrup - see recipe below
Dehydrated ginger slice - or any fruit of your choice, to garnish

Method:
1. Combine all ingredients and shake together vigorously for five seconds.
2. Strain into your desired glass over ice and enjoy.

Sugar Syrup: Making sugar syrup requires equal parts sugar and water. You can also make a thicker style syrup by adding two parts sugar to one-part water.
1.  Boil the water in a saucepan, add the sugar and stir until it dissolves.
2. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
3. Store in a firmly sealed bottle or container in the fridge where it can keep for a few weeks.
