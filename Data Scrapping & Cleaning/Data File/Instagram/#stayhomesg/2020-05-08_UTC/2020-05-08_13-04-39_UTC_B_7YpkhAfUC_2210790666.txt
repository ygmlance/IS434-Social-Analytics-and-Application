55 days of #circuitbreakersg and we’re already at day 32! I’ve made some #cbgoals when the whole CB first started. By the end of this CB I want to:
.
1. Maintain my muscle but reducing my fat percentage. Reducing more fats around my waistline by adding more cardio and focusing more training on my abs.
.
2. Complete my Diploma in Physical Fitness study on Alison, then continue my study for ACE GFI and prepare for the exam end of this year.
.
3. Read more books. I’ve got a lot of books in my Kindle which I didn’t touch for ages and I want to finish at least 2 books by end of CB.
.
4. Continue my #CanGlowWithMe #glowwithcha #glowwithdoublej skincare journey and clear up even more pigmentations and pores on my face!
.
5. Practice more self love! I’m never perfect but I am perfectly happy to be who I am, what I do and whatever I have right now.
.
What's your stay at home goals?
