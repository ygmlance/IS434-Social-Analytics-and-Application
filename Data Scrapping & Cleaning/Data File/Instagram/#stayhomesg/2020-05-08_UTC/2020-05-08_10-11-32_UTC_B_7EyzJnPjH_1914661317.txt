Exercise is known to improve our moods, help us function better, sleep better, and improve our overall health. To encourage our children and their caregivers to stay active and stay healthy during the circuit breaker period, Club Rainbow held an online workout session 2 days ago. Led by our staff, everyone had fun learning the basic workout routine from the comfort and safety of their own home!  #OnlineWorkout #SGUnited #strongertogether #covid19 #coronav√≠rus #circuitbreaker #StayHomeSG #StayHomeWithClubRainbow
