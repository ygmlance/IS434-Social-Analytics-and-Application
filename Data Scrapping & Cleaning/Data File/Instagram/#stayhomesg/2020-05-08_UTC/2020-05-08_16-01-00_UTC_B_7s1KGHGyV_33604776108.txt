29 April, Brunch - Blueberry pancakes with a mango and strawberry mix. Also our first attempt at an action shot, with lots of off-camera "NOW!" "WAIT!" "FASTEERRR LAH" flying around. Photography is a tough craft! We really respect people who can take beautiful and moving pictures ðŸ˜Š

Also featuring this cute little pourer we finally got :>
