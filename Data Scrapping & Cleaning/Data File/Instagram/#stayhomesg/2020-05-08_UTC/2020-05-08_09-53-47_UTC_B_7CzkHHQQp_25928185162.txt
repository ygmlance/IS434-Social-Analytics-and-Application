Our Story | Laundry Woesâ €
â €
When A first moved in with P, laundry was an issue. â €
â €
A's clothes often gave off an acrid smell out of the washer and the smell contaminated P's clothes when they were washed together. This foul problem brought about some distress. â €
â €
"How have you been washing your clothes?" A asked.â €
â €
P shared how she would rinse off the sweat from the clothes to get rid of bacteria before throwing them into the washer. Ten years of experience in cheerleading had trained her well; her training outfit was often dank and putrid by the end of each training session, soaked with the sweat of hers and at least ten other team mates'. â €
â €
And so, with inputs from P and his mother (after all, mothers always know best), A experimented and found the most effective way to wash his clothes. â €
â €
Before dumping the clothes into the washer, he would:â €
â€¢ Soak in a bucket of water with detergent powderâ €
â€¢ Scrub and rinse offâ €
â €
We also discovered that the best way to get rid of a really stubborn nasty smell is to soak the clothes in a mixture of water, baking soda and vinegar. That works like magic every time. âœ¨â €
