Hey peeps, helping a friend to share a good cause during this difficult time and also to lighten and brighten up the mood a bit.

For my singing and/or musically incline buddies... Yes... I know I have quite a number of talented friends... YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE! I don't have to tag you right? hehe... Just upload your videos on social media. Make sure it's public and tag Sing for Singapore and hashtag #SingForSG #StayHomeStarSG #SGUnited #StayHomeSG #foragoodcause
