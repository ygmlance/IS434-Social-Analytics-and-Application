“Recipe adapted from @sonianll by adding @naturesglorysg organic extra virgin coconut oil and my homemade pandan extract. The end result is GOOD, everyone at home loves it! 👍🏼
.
Ingredients:
150g Self Raising Flour
40g Sugar
1/4 tsp Pink Salt
100g Bonsoy / Fresh Milk
10g Homemade Pandan Extract
1 Egg
15g Extra Virgin Coconut Oil
.
Steps
1. Mix flour, sugar and salt in mixing bowl
2. Add beaten egg, milk, pandan extract and coconut oil.
3. Use hand whisk to mix all ingredients and rest for 10-15 mins. (Refer to video for consistency of batter)
4. Scoop batter onto non-stick pan (without oil) to pan fry until golden brown on both side.
.
Notes
After scooping the batter into the pan, look out for tiny bubbles and slightly dry batter. That’s the time you can flip.
If no pandan extract just replace with milk.”
