When will my reflection show who I am inside?
In this time where we are all forced to stay in, I hope that we all have time to reflect on ourselves. Many times we put on facades in the midst of society. But it's in the alone times where the true test of who we are lies. Are u happy with who you are? Why? Why not? And what are you gonna do about it? Are you gonna be the same person you were before when society starts again? Does social media really matter? I'm still working on my answers. Hope you are too.
