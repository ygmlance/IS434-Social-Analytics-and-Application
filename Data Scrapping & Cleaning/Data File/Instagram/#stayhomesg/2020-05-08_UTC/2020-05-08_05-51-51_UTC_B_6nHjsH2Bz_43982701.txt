A light yet hearty and comforting lunch. Home cooked mushroom soup (Swiss brown, white & portobello), caramelised onions to add sweetness, roasted garlic for depth of flavour. A swirl of cream and some seared oyster mushrooms complete it. #mushrooms #soup #homecooking #singaporehomecooks #sgeats #sgfood #stfoodtrending #8dayseat #stayhomesg #curcuitbreaker #sghomecook #feedfeed #f52grams #foodphotography #foodgram #beautifulcuisines #huffposttaste #buzzfeedfood #heresmyfood #gloobyfood #lifeandthyme #foodandwine #forkyeah #foodbeast #foodiegram #sgfoodies #foodspotting #foodgawker #foodstagram #stayhomecookingchallenge
