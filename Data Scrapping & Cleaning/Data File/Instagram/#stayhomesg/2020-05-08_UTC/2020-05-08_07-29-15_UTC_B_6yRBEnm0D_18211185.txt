08 May 20 :: Day 32 of CB #circuitbreakersg. #wfh #sgunited #stayhomesg and #je55bakes #PandanChiffonCake for @loyseah initially.

This primary school friend called yesterday evening and asked if I can bake one for him. How to reject sia? Didn’t tell him that I’m baking for him this morning. #surprisefailed #kaykiang 🤦🏻‍♀️ So, he asked someone else to bake and had his craving satisfied yesterday.

Neh mind. I can have this beautifully risen, cottony-soft, light and fluffy Pandan Chiffon Cake for the family. All so good, except for the unmoulding. #needmorepractice

Ingredients (8 inch chiffon pan) ::
4 egg yolks
100g top flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 tbsp freshly squeezed pandan juice ** I blended 8 pandan leaves + 5 tbsp water together **
100ml coconut milk ** I used kara brand **
50ml canola oil
5 egg whites
100g caster sugar ** I reduced to 80g

Method ::
Preheat oven to 160 degree celcius. ** I used top and bottom heat ** Sift flour, salt and baking powder into a bowl.

Whisk egg yolks with half the sugar, until light and fluffy. ** I used manual hand whisk 💪🏻** Pour oil, pandan juice and coconut milk into the egg yolk mixture and whisk until combine.

Fold in the flour using a hand whisk or spatula until batter is smooth. Do not overfold or overmix. Set aside.

Place egg whites into a mixer bowl. Whisk egg whites at high speed. When it gets foamy, add in the remaining sugar slowly. Continue to whisk until it reaches stiff peak. 
Gently fold In the egg whites in 3 separate portions to the egg yolk batter, ensuring that the egg whites are well incorporated at each stage of folding. Do not overfold.

Pour the batter into an ungreased 8 inch chiffon pan. Tap the pan gently against the table and run the spatula in ‘S' motion throughout the batter to remove big air pockets. Smooth out the batter evenly.

Bake at the lowest rack for 45 mins.

When done, immediately remove from oven and invert the cake to cool completely before unmoulding. ** I used a beer bottle and inserted the pan tube into it **
