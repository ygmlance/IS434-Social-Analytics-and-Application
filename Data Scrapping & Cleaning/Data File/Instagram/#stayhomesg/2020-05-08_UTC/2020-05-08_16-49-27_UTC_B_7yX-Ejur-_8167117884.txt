Stay Home , Vesak Day...
“If you are quiet enough, you will hear the flow of the universe. You will feel its rhythm. Go with this flow. Happiness lies ahead. Meditation is key.” “Teach this triple truth to all: A generous heart, kind speech, and a life of service and compassion are the things which renew humanity.”
