27 April, Dinner - Fish sandwich with kimchi coleslaw and broccoli corn mix. The kimchi made everything orange! ðŸ˜‚ A day or two before Chinese New Year and COVID-19 reaching our shores, we made about 9kg of kimchi to pass to family and friends, but now we're stranded with about 4kg still ðŸ‘€. Going to try making Korean army stew some day!
