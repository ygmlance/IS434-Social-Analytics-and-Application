Happy with this batch of macaron shells after the setback yesterday! ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š Baking macaron is like a life lesson to have PATIENCE ~ some things just cannot be rushed...Been quite a while since i baked macarons coz of the fear of failure! Since the weather was pretty good today (??), i decided to give it a try again plus it's going to part of a small project for this weekend, so I must succeed!!ğŸ’ªğŸ’ª Though these babies are still not perfect in their looks, am so glad to see "feet" & nice shiny flat tops. Waiting to fill them with homemade lemon curd and mixed berries buttercream!ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹ Just as I was putting the macaron shells into the fridge, lil jae came and told me to keep them higher, away from his reach coz they taste so good!ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ (Note to self: if macarons disappear tmr morning, I know who the culprit is!ğŸ˜‰ğŸ˜‰) #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #homecooking #sghomecooks #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday32 #bakersg #homebakersg
