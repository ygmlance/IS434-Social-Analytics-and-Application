What a beautiful mess.. A cacophony of sweet, tangy, crunchy, crispy, spicy and so much more. All the staff are either Hainanese or from Hainan Island so you know this is legit 👍🏻 Managed to get ours in 10 mins despite the queue 🤫🤫🤫. Slide over to the last picture to see how many people are actually queueing for this under the sun! .
