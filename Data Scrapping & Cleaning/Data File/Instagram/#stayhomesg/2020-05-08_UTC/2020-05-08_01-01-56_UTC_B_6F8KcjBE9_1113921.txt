@bakerandcooksg launches an exciting and new take home bagel series in three flavours. Enjoy them fresh or toasted at any time of the day with Baker & Cook's new sourdough bagels in plain ($6.90), onion sesame seed ($7.50) or 7 grains & seeds ($7.50). Handcrafted and made by time-honoured processes and honest ingredients, the brand’s specialty bagels incorporate natural wild yeast used in Baker & Cook’s signature Pain au Levain and other sourdoughs. It boasts an irresistibly chewy texture which is a result from the long, unhurried process of natural fermentation in a temperature-controlled, cool environment over 12 hours coupled with gelatinizing the crust through poaching. Each pack contains four delectable bagels and weighs in at 380g. The versatility of these sourdough bagels makes them a wholesome and nutritious pantry staple. These breads and New Sourdough Bagels can be purchased in-stores at select Cold Storage @coldstoragesg and Market Place by Jasons outlets.
