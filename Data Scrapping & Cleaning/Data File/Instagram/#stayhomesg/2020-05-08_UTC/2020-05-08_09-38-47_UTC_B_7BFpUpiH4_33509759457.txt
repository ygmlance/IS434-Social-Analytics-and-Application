If you’re over Dalgona Coffee and making your own muah chee, gardening is an underrated circuitbreaker hobby. The horticulturalists at @gardensbythebay have just launched #StayHomeWithGB, a series of how-to videos, virtual tours and advice columns for greenhorn-greenthumbs toiling alone in their gardens/HDB corridors/condo windowboxes.

PS You can still exercise around GB’s public grounds, provided you follow social distancing guidelines and wear a mask for all but strenuous activity.
