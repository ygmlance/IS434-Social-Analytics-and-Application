Tin foil and Cotton Bud Painting ðŸŽ¨ went pretty successful. Pretty successful because the little one had enough of the foil and wanted to paint his tray table blue too..after 15 minutes. Not bad! ðŸ˜‚

Why tin foil and not regular paper you ask. Teaches him to be gentle with the foil as it tears more easily. Letâ€™s just say the gentleness of this activity didnâ€™t last too long too ðŸ˜… And with cotton bud, it improves his fine motor skill!

Give it a go #toddlermoms ðŸ’•
