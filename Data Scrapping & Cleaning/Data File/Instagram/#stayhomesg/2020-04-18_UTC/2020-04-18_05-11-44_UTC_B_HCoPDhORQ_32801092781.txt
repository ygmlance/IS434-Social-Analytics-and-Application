Circuit breaker Day 12: Steak & mash + sides 👍👍👍 All this cost $117.70 (with delivery):
- 4 Steak & mash
- 3 Sautéed mushrooms
- 1 Creamed spinach
- 1 Foie gras
Nothing to fault, creamed spinach was so good! Would order again & maybe get my own bruschetta to eat with the foie gras 😋
📍The Feather Blade (Club St)
