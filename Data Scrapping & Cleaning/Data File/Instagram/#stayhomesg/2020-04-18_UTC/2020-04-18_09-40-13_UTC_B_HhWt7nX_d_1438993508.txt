Hola! I am loving #workfromhomelife so much! Feeling so much more productive in terms of keeping up with my workouts and my assignments on hand! Plus, eating home = eating healthy (most of the time) so life is good, I feel blessed and healthy! 
Those who attended my #livestream session this morning, let me know in the comments how you've enjoyed it!? I can't see the full video because I wasn't the host so I didn't get to see everyone who joined as well! But according to the screenshots and photos sent, I'm heartened to see so many of you guys! Special shoutout to my regular Saturday hot yogis, I miss you all too! Definitely going to host this again (probably longer session next time), especially so for my hot yogis!ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª @parve_kaur @sandraischiuy @omzjessy @shanyi_liew @vvviviennn @gohelynn @amittto @venusvernyce_ @huislu @_cheongtai #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg
