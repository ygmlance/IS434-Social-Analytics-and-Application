The hard days are the days that make us stronger
.

Continue to grind on daily.. it’s tough and feel like giving up... but the thought of getting healthier & fitter just push us through... finish the workout first then worry about the aches later... lol .

Completed 60 minutes of workout for me and Linnet completed 20 minutes

Great to have a companion for workout lately... missed the gym, run and walk with my friends
