Oh yayyyy! The cake industry is finally back to normal today, selling cakes to ease all our sweet tooth 🦷 cravings. We walked to our neighbourhood bread shop and grabbed a Chocolate Swiss Roll cake freshly out from the oven, they smell heavenly fragrant! 🤤🤤 Truly, that sugary chocolaty aroma smells so familiar and irresistible! It’s been awhile since we had swiss rolls!⠀ ⠀
These beautifully baked Swiss roll cake is so soft and fluffy, rolled with buttercream in between. Smiling in happiness as we slowly indulge in our cake while typing this post! Are you also heading out or ordering cake from your favourite cake brands? ⠀
