Help us raise food for the shelters & set a record!! ⁠
⁠
In light of the tough times during this Covid-19 situation, we decided to encourage pet owners to come together on the 23rd of May, Saturday, 2pm for the largest virtual event to set the record for the most number of pets and their humans gathered on a video call to raise food for the animal shelters! ⁠
⁠
During this time, we want to be able to help pet parents connect and bond with their pets and create memories! ⁠
⁠
For every participant that joins the call, we will be donating 1kg of dry food to the following shelters:⁠ @causesforanimals_sg 
@f7homekennel
@hopedogrescue 
@sgpawsangels17112 
@mercylightsg 
@animalloversleague.sg

Participating sponsors include well-known brands like Nutrience, Taste of the Wild, Nurture Pro, Addiction, and Heka. ⁠
⁠
The 30mins Zoom call will include a vet talk, a trainer sharing tips and ideas for entertaining pets at home, setting the record and a group photo to celebrate our bonds with our pets!⁠
