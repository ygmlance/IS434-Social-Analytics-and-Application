[So France] - Beef Burger ($24), with a patty made with a combination of brisket and chuck, layered with sundried tomatoes, raclette cheese, rocket and caramelised onion. Served medium rare, I reckon the patty needs more fats to up its beefy flavour. But overall, it was still quite a pleasure to bite into the fat burger, especially when the custom made sourdough bun was so light and chewy. You will appreciate the fries too, which is made with potatoes from France.
