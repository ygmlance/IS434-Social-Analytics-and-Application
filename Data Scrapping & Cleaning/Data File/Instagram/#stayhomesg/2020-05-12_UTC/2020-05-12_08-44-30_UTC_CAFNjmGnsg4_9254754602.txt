Corrective & activation exercise is often being overlooked in the fitness industry but it is essential for hitting fitness goals more quickly.

Corrective work isn’t just for people who are already in pain or suffering an injury but it is also great for improving athletic performance. -

The idea is to switch on key muscles, realign your musculoskeletal structure to help prevent injury and improve your performance ahead of the training you are about to complete.

Hence, in FTI we incorporate corrective exercises in our R`4 Group PT preparing your body into better alignment for optimal function.

Come & experience our R’4 Group PT (Intermediate Session) via Zoom tomorrow Wed, 13th May at 7pm complimentary for first timers! -
