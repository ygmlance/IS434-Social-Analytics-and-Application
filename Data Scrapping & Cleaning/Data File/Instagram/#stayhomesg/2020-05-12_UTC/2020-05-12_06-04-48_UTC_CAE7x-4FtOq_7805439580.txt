Posted @withregram • @cactogether Thank You, Lord! Covid19 Testimonies.
The Covid19 pandemic has affected many of us in different ways.  Whether it is finding joy in staying at home, discovering new skills with the slowdown of your work, or surviving the virus as a patient or frontline healthcare worker, how have you experienced the grace of God this season? How has the glory of our merciful Lord been revealed to you?  We want to hear your stories!  Share your “Thank You, Lord - Covid19 Testimonies” with us, to encourage someone who is seeking God’s comfort at this moment.  Or if you or your church have done something awesome to share God’s love, let’s hear all about it and motivate each other!  Your testimony will be collated and published in the June 2020 issue of CAC News (bi-lingual quarterly newsletter published by CAC). You can send us pictures, short points, an article write-up, video or even a voice message.  Email to us at boc.cac@methodist.org.sg and we will be in touch.  Publishing priority will be given to testimonies contributed by members of CAC / Methodist churches. Please connect with us by 18 May 2020, so we can contact you. 
Hebrews 10:24-25 “And let us continue to consider how to motivate one another to love and good deeds… but encouraging one another even more as you see the day of the Lord coming nearer.” 疫情中感恩
