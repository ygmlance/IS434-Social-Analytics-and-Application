A really fun thing that my kids have been up to since HBL ended... making videos of their own.

è‡ªç¼–è‡ªå¯¼è‡ªæ¼” (self-produced) episodes of The Flash or Marvel will be painstakingly filmed with narration, props and brilliant acting no less! Not only does it occupy their whole afternoon and (as educators may say) breed creativity, I think the best thing is... we get to watch their videos after and have a good laugh ðŸ¤£ðŸ¥° #growingupwithsiblings #stayhomesg
