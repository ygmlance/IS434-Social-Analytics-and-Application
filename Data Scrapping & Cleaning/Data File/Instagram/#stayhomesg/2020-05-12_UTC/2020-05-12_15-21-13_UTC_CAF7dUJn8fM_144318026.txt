Today I started my 1 to 1 with a kid. Will set aside an hr to do any hands-on activity with a kid each day for the #circuitbreakerholiday 
Started with my girl. Instead ifndoing the polymer plate, she saw the pretty charms and we did the sunflower from Easy Charms for Beginners by creative Rachy.
Baked it and we did our first batch of sunflower charms!
