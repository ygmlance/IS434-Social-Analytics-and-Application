Calories burned during exercise or any physical activity is influenced by individual body weight, workout intensity, conditioning level and metabolism.

This chart is a very broad estimate and it isn't going to be exact. The only way to get a truly accurate number is to go to a lab and have them hook you up to machines that measure everything from your maximum oxygen uptake to your maximum heart rate. But no one will go to that extend. 😄

The closer way to find out, u may use this online calories calculator to give you a better estimation. Or you may do a quick google search on calories calculator. 😊
