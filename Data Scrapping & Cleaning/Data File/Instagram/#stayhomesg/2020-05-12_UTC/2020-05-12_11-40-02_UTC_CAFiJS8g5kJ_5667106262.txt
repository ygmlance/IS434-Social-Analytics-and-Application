I attempted to make IKEA meatballs with cream sauce & mash potatoes on the side. 
Based on the recipe that was published, it wasn’t too difficult to make but the preparation took time, especially when you’re making a lot for the family too.

My efforts didn’t go to waste and I’m glad they liked it! -
