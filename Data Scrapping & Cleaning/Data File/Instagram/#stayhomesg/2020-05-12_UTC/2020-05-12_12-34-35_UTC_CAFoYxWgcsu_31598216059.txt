mother's day brunch: gruyere cheese souffles! 🤱💐
.
last year, for a treat, my mom and I went on a mother-daughter trip to Paris. it was my first time there and everything blew me away! gorgeous weather, beautiful architecture, great shopping and the most delicious food! I tried my first cheese souffle at @restaurantlerecamier recommended to me by my friend and since then have been dreaming about it 🤤
.
since this summer, we wont be able to travel #stayhomesg , I thought I'd recreate that dish from our special trip last year for my mom...they say that when you eat food, you remember moments and memories - because it reawakens your senses: visual, olfactory, gustatory and occasionally auditory ☺️
.
recipe is from @frenchguycooking , if you've ever been afraid to try making souffles,  don't be! it's not that difficult and the effort is worth it 😉
.
will be sharing my #lessonslearnt in souffles soon! so stay tuned ☺️
.
what did you have for mothers day? ☺️
