Day 36 - Last part of my dinner.
Desserts with Marigold peach yogurt & jelly.
I have gotten this pink flower pot as a free gifts from marigold but never used. Today i decided to use it.
I am a bit rough on handling the jelly. I broke it while trying to remove from the jelly mould otherwise it will look very pretty and cute.
Since the yogurt didn't comes with a spoon i used this flower spoon to scoop. Pretty right?
