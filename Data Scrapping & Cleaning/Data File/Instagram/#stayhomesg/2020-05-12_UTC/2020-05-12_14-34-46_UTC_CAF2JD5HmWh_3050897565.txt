@mykuali Penang Hokkien Prawn Noodle soup. Seriously one of the best cup noodles ever. Amazing how much flavour was in the soup - the thick paste can probably flavour many more portions. And when you see pastes and not powder you know its damn promising.
Eggs and tomato not included though fried onions are. 
This was recommended by @straitstimesfood in their instant noodle feature and really has a delicious thick broth @mykuali_penang  #penang #prawnnoodles #hokkienmee #prawnmee #noodles #mie #mee #sgfoodie #lamian #ramen #penangfood @msposhnosh #instantnoodles #cupnoodles #ramyun
