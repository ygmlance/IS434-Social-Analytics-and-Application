.It's done. I'm panting. In a good way:)
.
.This video was three days' work. Mainly cos I was struggling with how my vocals sound, and also cos I have no audio mixing experience, so I did a lot of stuff wrong. I had to re-record, re-mix, re-do, many many times.
.
.But it's done:)
.
.Because of this song, I went back to watching some past episodes of Pokémon. It brought me so much joy and tears when I was young, and the show still moves me now. It taught me about love, friendship, never giving up, and also partings and goodbyes.
.
.I love Pokémon:) .
