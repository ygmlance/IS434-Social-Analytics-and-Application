And so, the best thing I have eaten so far during this circuit breaker period is this sashimi bowl. Please take a moment to admire this beauty, the Toro Uni Ikura don from Ryo Sushi. üòç
It not only looks good, it tastes really good as well. Everything gelled perfectly; from the seafood to the rice and the sauce. Most importantly, the seafood is very fresh and the price is very reasonable. Salmon and salmon belly sashimi in the side are of generous cuts too. 
I love it so much I have ordered it twice during this circuit breaker period!
