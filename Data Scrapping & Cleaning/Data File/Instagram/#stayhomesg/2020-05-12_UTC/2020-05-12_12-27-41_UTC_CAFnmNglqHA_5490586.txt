Staying home past month or so gave the both of us opportunities to do a lot colouring & drawing. No doubt it comes with challenges like him going all over me but its an hour of our time together figuring out something plus i find some sanity when i draw and colour as well. Mostly me trying to draw his favourite avengers characters or like batman and he colours. We have been doing a series of mask im yet to post. Here is a card he did for his Granddad(Achicha) today. Funny I recall watching Batman and stuff with my Dad.  #daddyofjays #fatherhood #selfparenting #birthday #stayhomesg #artwithkids #sons #stayingsane
