Circuit breaker Day 36: Roast meats 👍 How does one make a roast meat dabao look good? No matter what angle & lighting I try it looks like this 😂 Anyway, roast meat was not bad but don’t understand the longggg queue for it at all. Have had better ones elsewhere but still a good everyday kind of dabao food.
📍Bedok cooked food (Kovan)
