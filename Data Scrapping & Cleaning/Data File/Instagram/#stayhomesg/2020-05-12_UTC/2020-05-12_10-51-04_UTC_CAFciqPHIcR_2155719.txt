This evening I’m serving a cantonese dish which is minced pork with salted fish claypot rice.  砂锅咸鱼肉饼饭

The two key ingredients are the salted fish and the minced meat.  The salted fish I have used is Mui Heong and is of a better quality salted fish. The salted fish is soft and easily turns into a paste with the slightest pressure.  So when you place it on top of the minced meat, it is easy to pick up and mix it with the meat. 
The minced pork that i used for this dish is 70% lean and 30% fatty. Do not use 100% lean as you may find it very chewy after it’s cooked. 
I added a pair of Chinese sausages to enhance flavour. 
To serve, we add in some shredded ginger and spoon a special soya sauce on the rice and mix it all together. 
This is such a easy and comforting one pot rice dish. Though it looks humble but yet very yummy. I think I will eat more bowls of rice. 😬

I’m digging in now... #mincedporkwithsaltedfish #mincedpork #saltedfish #claypot #stayhomeatsg #stayhomesg #stayhomewithascott #咸鱼肉饼饭 #stayunited #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodies #whati8today #cantonesefood #homecookingisthebest #stayhomecookoff #家常菜 #circuitbreakersg #asiancuisine #家庭料理 #feedfeed #foodpics
