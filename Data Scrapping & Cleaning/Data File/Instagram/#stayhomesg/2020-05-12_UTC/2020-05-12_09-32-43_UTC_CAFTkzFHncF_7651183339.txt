To ensure her daughter receives the medical attention she needs, 77-year-old Mdm Jumaiah is dependent on her savings and financial assistance. COVID-19 has disrupted their lives even further, making it difficult for her to access daily essentials as public exposure would leave her vulnerable to the virus.⁣⁣⁣
⁣
YMCA Wok the Talk has been able to alleviate the situation for her through delivering monthly grocery packs to her door, enabling her to stay home, safe from the virus.⁣⁣⁣

We need your help so we can keep reaching out to vulnerable seniors like Mdm Jumaiah, and others including migrant workers and persons with special needs. Find out how you can help through the link in the bio!⁣⁣⁣
