#stayhonesg: WFH and WiFi Down!
Maybe knowing I have overworked, today due to outage, I can't work. So, after a session of Zentangle, made a simplified Pumpkin Kaya (Pumpkin Jam) using steamed pumpkin blend with coconut milk. Cooked the puree till slightly thicken. Sugar (optional). This time round, due to the blender is about to retire, the pumpkin puree wasnt that soft but lumpy. Still nice.
