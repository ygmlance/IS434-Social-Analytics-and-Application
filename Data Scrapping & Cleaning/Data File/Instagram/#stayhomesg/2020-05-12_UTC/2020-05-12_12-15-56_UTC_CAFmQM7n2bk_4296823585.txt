Repost• @heynickmitchell Makes you think?
No, literally aping this photo I don’t think group exercise should carry on as normal, but I do think some small practical measures could EASILY be taken to 1) allow limited gym use, and 2) keep fitness businesses alive. Maybe now some of you are starting to realize that a shitload of gyms are about to go under. By a “shitload” I mean possibly 80% plus in the UK.

And if you call me a selfish cnut for this, well 1) yes, selfishly I want to protect my business for my family and my hard working team and their hundreds of families, and 2) UP will survive a year of full shutdown, most other fitness businesses will not, and I’ll be fucked if I sit back and say nothing whilst their lives are ruined but for those in power spending the one hour it would need to look at other parts of the world and exercise some common sense.

I’d also add that there is no legitimate reason to keep those who are not in contact with vulnerable people on this lockdown.
