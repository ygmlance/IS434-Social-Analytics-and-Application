Our father passed away from #lungcancer. He did not smoke tobacco or cigarettes in his life, I did not know how much #secondhandsmoke that he endured in his life time. While I know that grief takes its own time, I am thankful for the years I had with our father. During his life, our father had instilled in us: a passion in learning from people (either face-to-face, books that they have written, documentaries that they have produced) and places (nature, culture, etc), and a sense of #responsibility. He told us that, in his youth, he would do twice to thrice the amount of physical work that other workers did daily, and he viewed it as an exercise to strengthen his body. 
After working hard to raise us, he dreamed to bring our mother to travel around Asia especially #China. To prepare for it, our father had been active, exercising daily, attempting to improve exercise motions to share to others. He also dreamed to teach some exercise motions to #elderlies who suffer strokes at the #oldfolkhomes to ease their pain. 
At the funeral parlour, a friend/student of my father who was 88 years old, kindly shared with me that he suffered from pain trying to straighten his fingers, but with my father's guidance, he exercised certain motions and was relief of the pain. We thought that our mother could visit China this year, but it is likely that we have to wait until next year. Nevertheless, we are blessed to live in this digital age, we could re-visit where we have been to and virtually visit places we hope to experience. Herein, I share some math questions (https://tinyurl.com/math20200512), which were first written for our P1 son and inspired by his late grandfather's dream. #ThankYouFather #ThankYouGrandfather #GreatWallSimatai #theGreatWallofChina #GreatWall #GreatWallofChina #GreatWallChina #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #stayhome #stayhomestaysafe https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
