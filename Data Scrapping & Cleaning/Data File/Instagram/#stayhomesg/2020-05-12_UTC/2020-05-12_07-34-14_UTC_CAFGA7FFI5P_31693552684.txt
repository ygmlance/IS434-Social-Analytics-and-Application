First time growing sprouts on our own. As usual, boy's enthusiasm died down throughout the 4 days but he was still thrilled to watch the sprouts develop and cut them out of the milk carton boxes on the last day. Wasn't expecting such a huge harvest from just a half cup of beans!
.
Glad to have achieved 3 things:
1) Food (Hello, Laksa) 
2) Science (teaching moment on germination and growth of beans) 
3) Reusing (milk cartons were leftovers from boy's farm fresh UHT) .
