😋Taste: 7/10. The bright colours of this dish cheered us up upon sight. The tomatoes were well dressed and tasted like bruschetta topping. The lemons divided our family - some loved the sour tang it offered, wheres other felt that the peel was too hard, bitter, and still overly sour. The recipe called for pomegranate seeds which we didn’t have, and the potential added sweetness could be much welcomed. Next time around, we might chop up the lemon more finely, and add pomegranate and pomegranate molasses!
