CB week 5 almost done. As I get more comfortable with this whole WFH arrangement, I should also start adjusting my body back to the pre-CB times right? Heh but I shall cherish what I can do with freedom while working! Presenting mini pancakes bites - something I discover on IG that gives me a lot of volume in my food and satiation. It works like eating cereal yknow? ðŸ˜‹ and to give myself a little sweet, I go for @myproteinsg milk tea protein powder as the dip... And a few more slices of bread by @sunshinebakeries (this is plant-based)! My staple for breakfast, done! Donâ€™t forget the cinnamon sprinkles before serving!

Time for more work! Hang on there, Singapore!
