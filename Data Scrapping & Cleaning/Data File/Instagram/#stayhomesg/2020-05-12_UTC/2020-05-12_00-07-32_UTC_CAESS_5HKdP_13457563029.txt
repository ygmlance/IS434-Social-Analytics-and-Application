Do you or your kids have a favourite cartoon series? @mrmenofficial is her current fave - because of the books we read and the set of clothes my dear friend @eilynn_ gave our family (cutest set ever) 😂.
.
So, I prepared an activity some two months back and I came across this video today, while doing some housekeeping on my phone. I thought it was a pretty fun doodling moment, as much as the activity didn’t go as planned.
.
💝And as usual, I hope you’ll see that drawings are just a combination of shapes and lines - so try your hand at it today and enjoy the therapeutic benefits of creation! Because, #easyartathome 😉.

Little Miss Sunshine wishing you a wonderful morning ahead!
