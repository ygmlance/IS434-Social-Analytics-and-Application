A true legend and his winning mindset that many have yet to master. During this time, it is REALLY easy to admit defeat and give up the game. ⁠⠀

Be it in business, finding new jobs, or even in adapting to the new normal in relationships. We should approach every task with the goal to 'win it no matter what'. ⁠⠀
