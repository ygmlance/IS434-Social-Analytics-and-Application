Asian-Style Baked Rice ☁️Kid-Friendly☁️ || My little Asian girl loves her Asian meals. Like mama, she would probably choose mee sua or fried rice over pasta any day. In order to continuously expand her taste palate, i make fusion meals she won’t reject. Today, we tried Baked Rice with Asian flavours made in muffin tins. She approved! Best of all, prep time was not more than 15mins! .
