I purchased this meal from Chef @josephyeois as I‘ve always thought he has a knack for putting a unique spin on fusing Asian and West flavours and techniques. True enough, these Bento Sets from “Gourmadise”, his home-based business, demonstrated that perfectly. All three were imbued with flair and finesse, and had an air of casual elegance about them. I attribute that to Chef Joseph’s early career at Les Amis and most recently, as the Head Chef at #SPRMRKT.
For his Thai Basil Chicken Aglio Olio, he stirfried al dente spaghetti with minced meat in a fragrant mix of garlic, chilli, herbs and fish sauce that was not too spicy. Completing this $14 Bento Set was a house-made Achar and a Steamed Layer Cake. 
What I loved most about the Tri-Coloured Quinoa with Tempeh Beancurd Set ($13) was how flavourful the Caramelised Bean Sauce used to fry the cubes of beancurd and #tempeh was. It tasted a lot like my late grandmother’s #AyamTempra dish, albeit it being meatless. This Bento had the same accompanying Achar and Steamed Cake as the previous.
Unlike them, the third Bento Set of Twice Cooked Chicken Thigh with Ayam Bakar Sauce ($14) had an Idaho Potato Mash and an Asian-style Cherry Tomato Salad as the sides instead. Coated in a thick “kichap manis” sauce, I thought the chicken was really delicious as well. Having been sous vide then seared, it had a lovely smokiness, and was tender and juicy within.
If you are keen to try @josephyeois’ delivery menu, do drop him a DM like I did.
