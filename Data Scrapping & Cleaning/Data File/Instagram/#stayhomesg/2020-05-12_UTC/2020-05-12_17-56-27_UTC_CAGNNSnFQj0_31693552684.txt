I am a HUGE fan of thermal pots. They help me achieve continuous slow cooking without standing by the stove, a momentous need with clingy kids.
.
I love cooking broth with my TP to great effect. Here's sharing how that wondrous collagen is extracted from boiling chicken feet.
.
Note: in 24hrs, broth starts to turn really milky, more so when increased to 48hrs. The difference isn't obvious by 72hrs. And I love jiggling that collagen once it has cooled down.
. 
I used 12 feet and added 1 chicken carcass and white corn for extra flavours. These were cooked with my 3 litres La Gourmet Sakura.
.
Hope this inspires you to take up thermal cooking. ðŸ˜Š
