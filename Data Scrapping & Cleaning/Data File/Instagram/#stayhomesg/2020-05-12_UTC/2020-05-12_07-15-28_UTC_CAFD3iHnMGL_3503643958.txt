✨ NEW PRODUCT - FARRO ✨

Farro is an ancient wheat grain that has been around for thousands of years. It's a great alternative to other popular grains, such as rice, quinoa, buckwheat and barley.

Farro is an extremely nutritious grain loaded with fibre (even more than brown rice), protein, and antioxidants. A high-fibre diet is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and higher levels of gut-friendly bacteria.

Farro is easy to prepare and goes well with a variety of meals - soups, salads, and stews. It can also eaten in a similar style to granola or oat porridge. 
NOTE: Farro contains gluten, so it is not suitable for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
