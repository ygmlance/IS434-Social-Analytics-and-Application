Day 36 Circuit breaker lunch.
Cooked up shredded chicken organic barley brown rice porridge.
Very good for a hot wheather like today.
Used the same steaming method like yesterday to do.
Yes. The egg when in together. I used a round drinking glass to shape,  and wrapped around it. 3 layers. It becomes a little round shape disposable bowl. Just throw away after that no need to wash. Ladies who just learn to cook, i just want to say no need to buy special equipment to poached egg. Like that also can de.
With the a little salty  You Tiao or You Char Kway, it goes so well with the porridge.
Actually i wanted to add Century egg & sweet potatoes but i was too lazy to slice it.
Thankfully,  i didn't do it, because i was really full after cleaning up everything on my bowl. üòÅ
