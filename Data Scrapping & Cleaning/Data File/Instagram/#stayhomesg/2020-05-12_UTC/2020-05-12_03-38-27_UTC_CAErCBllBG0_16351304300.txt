If you’re a fan of Hakka Lei Cha (擂茶), you would probably have heard of ’Thunder Tea Rice’. What you probably didn’t know is that ‘Thunder Tea Rice’ is not really the name of the dish but the name of a company. When Mr Alvin Tan and Mrs Callie Lim first tried the dish, they both experienced a shock. They described it as a lightning shock, since thunder (雷) can be extracted from the word Lei Cha (擂茶), it led to them naming their company Thunder Tea Rice Pte Ltd 18 years ago. 
As their popularity grew, they received criticism for their name with some critics questioning their ability to understand the Chinese characters. Both founders would like to clarify that they most certainly do. They just wanted to brand themselves differently from other stores serving the Hakka Lei Cha. 
In a strange turn of events, Hakka Lei Cha Fan is now widely known as Thunder Tea Rice in Singapore. 
As with most local businesses, sales has definitely dropped for Thunder Tea Rice. However, after some sharing on Facebook groups and engaging in Island-wide deliveries with no min. order requirements, they’ve started to see a gradual increase in sales. Although sales number may fluctuate, they’re glad to see some new customers as well as regular customers supporting them.
