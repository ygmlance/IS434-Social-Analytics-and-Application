Bitters & Love featuring the Drinks Care Package during this Circuit Breaker for you to start your day right and end your night well. For the customised version of this package, you are getting up to 4 coffees (non-coffee options are available too) and a customised cocktail that serves 2. We’d totally recommend it on a Friday – where you need that potent caffeine to start your day and some great cocktail at night to welcome the weekend!

Also, we are loving how they are introducing zero waste with their Cocktail Sustainability Initiative. To minimise the amount of packaging used during the delivery of their products, they are actually delivering cocktails in fruits or vegetables! They are even asking you to toss that vegetable into your salad after you’re done with the booze. Nice! 🍸🍹 Islandwide delivery available on their website.
