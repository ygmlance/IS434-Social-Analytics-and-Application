100% Natural and our Foam Cleanser is safe for your delicate skin and health.‚ù§ The market in beauty products has grown significantly in the last 25 years, but in the previous ten years, there has been an increasing interest in the ingredients contained within the lotions, creams, and potions we apply so liberally to our skin - the largest organ of our human bodies.

Many leading stream manufacturers still include a range of not so natural ingredients in their products: - waste products from the petrochemical industry
- lead and other heavy metals
- products extracted from animal carcasses

Many consumers require natural ingredients but are not prepared to accept the necessary compromise in product performance. A classic example is with the ingredient Sodium Lauryl Sulphate. This synthetic detergent is derived from coconut oil, and it appears in a wide range of shampoos, bath products, toothpastes, and liquid soaps. It is what gives these products the luxurious bubbles and lather to which we have all become accustomed. Many studies have suggested that this ingredient is harmful, and many consumers now seek products containing an alternative.
