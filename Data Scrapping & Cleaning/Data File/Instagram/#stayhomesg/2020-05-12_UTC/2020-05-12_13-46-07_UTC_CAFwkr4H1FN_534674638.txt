The Mother’s Day weekend was filled with gratitude and love. Delivered this vase of handcrafted paper lilies to healthcare mummies (I hope the flowers will brighten your days and cheer you on!), and a mini-initiative with fellow mumpreneurs to write and post love messages to them. I’ll be starting an art journal soon to share these inspirations and stories behind - can’t wait! .

‘Mother’, 2020
Lilies symbolize attributes of purity, spiritual flowering, Great Mothers and saints. Every mother possesses this deep inner beauty, in their own special way nourishing their children and the people around them ❤️ My choice of watercolour and flesh-tone represents this natural beauty.  The red outlines - ‘blood and sweat’ - from our healthcare worker mummies and their sacrifices for the greater good.
