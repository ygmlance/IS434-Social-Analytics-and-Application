Buttery paav and delicious subzi together called Paav Bhaji is my favourite food from back home! This is a ubiquitous favourite among many Mumbaikars . 
My mom recreated the street style flavours of Mumbai at home today! 
Most recipes you find on the internet will suggest you to add carrots but I suggest skip it for a more authentic taste and definitely don’t skimp on the garlic . 
Paav was supplied by @suvaifoods , as close as possible to what we get back home. 
Recipe in a nutshell : 
Take a pan, add mustard oil and a bit of salted butter. Toss jeera. Add finely diced onions , garlic nicely pounded , ginger nicely pounded , puréed tomatoes , mashed boiled potatoes , pressure cooked capsicum, peas, cauliflower . Add generous amount of Paav bhaji masala, chilli powder, salt. Let it cook well together.  Squeeze lemon on top and add some chopped coriander before turning off the stove. 
While serving garnish with chopped onions , chopped coriander with a dollop of salted butter on top and a side of lemon pieces.
