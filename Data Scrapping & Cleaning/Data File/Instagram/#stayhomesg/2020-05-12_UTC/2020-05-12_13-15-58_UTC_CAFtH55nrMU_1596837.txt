Best Satay No. 7 & 8 is famous for their succulent satays at Lau Pa Sat. 
They are now doing home deliveries for their frozen marinated satay meats for you to cook up a feast at home.
They’re available in Chicken, Beef, and Mutton. 
Each kilogram of marinated satay meat comes with a packet of 500g satay peanut sauce.
So convenient and delicious 😋!! (Note: Marinated meats come raw and without skewers) .
Perfect meal for this coming Ramadan with your own household family :) .
