Sharing one of my fav peranankan place (Godmama's!) with family on this Mother's Day! It's also the first take-out we had in this CB period, incidentally for a cuisine that's probably hardest to recreate at home! We had the very sumptious set menu + additional sides at great value with prompt delivery, great service and of course great taste (albeit food could be warmer)
