Abstract Art - LIFE.
.
.
When Life is born, it is like a piece of white paper (the background), slowly life’s journey started to write things onto it (from our lifetime experience and etc.) with many memories, some good one, some not so good one, some get faded away and some remember for a lifetime. Life is a complicated journey and process (the lines), Life is like a cloud, it appears just for a short while and will vanish in the wing (see the appearance of lines, from light to bold and turns to lighter again). When it is gone, hopefully, it raises to heaven above.
