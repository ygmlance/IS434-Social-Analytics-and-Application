Not me for sure, especially since I’ve been stalking @esquinasg’s Instagram posts and stories? 😁.
When I swung by to collect the lunch, I had a peek (while standing at the entrance) at the way things are now done at Chef @carlosmontobbio’s restaurant. I’m sure it’s the same everywhere else as F&B establishments make the necessary changes to cope with requirements of the Circuit Breaker while doing their best to keep afloat.
Anyway, I was full of anticipation especially after he flashed their bestselling Carabinero #Paella at me. Crowned with rosy-red #Carabinero Prawns, the glorious golden-brown rice in the pan revealed itself to be immensely delicious as the grains were saturated in an insanely umami seafood stock. By the way, a refund of $20 is given when you return the pan.
As I‘d been eyeing Esquina’s collection of pressed #sandwiches for a while, it was a joy to finally sink my teeth into one, the Iberico Ham & Brie to be exact. Verdict: Uber flavourful and satisfying, it’d make a great lunch when working from home too.
I must say, their “Pan Con Tomato” (bread with tomato) achieved the amazing feat of tasting as wonderful as if I were to have had it on-site at the restaurant. Piling the silky slices of #Iberico Bellota on the bread seemed like the right thing to do too.
What I found really enjoyable as well was the Chicken Cordon Bleu which had sweet ham and smoked Emmental cheese rolled with moist chicken meat and sealed in a crunchy coating. The gravy of tomato and mushroom complemented that fat bolster beautifully. 
#Pasta isn’t something you’d expect from a Spanish restaurant but the hearty Fresh Tagliatelle, prepared with Chimmichuri and hand-formed meatballs, was a delight.
I alternated bites of the Iberico Ham #Croquettas with sips of the Spanish Sangria as the saucy filling was countered pleasurably by the fruity alcohol.
Chef Carlos, bless him, decided we needed two desserts. The sugar-coated #Churros accompanied by a thick dark chocolate dip was yums but I preferred the Basque Style #BurntCheesecake. If you love ooey-gooey food, this will rock your world.
