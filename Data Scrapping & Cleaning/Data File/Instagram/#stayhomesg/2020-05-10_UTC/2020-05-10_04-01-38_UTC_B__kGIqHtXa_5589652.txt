Most blessed Mother’s Day to all Mums-to-be,
Furkidz’ Mums and Queen of our hearts!! 👸🏻💕
.
Today, Daddy scored me a relaxin’ tea date with my most precious gift (only you keep eating 😆) and we reminisced on some precious #throwback with the Queen of my heart, dressed in our fave @joopboutique too! 💫 #trigeneration
.
The start of 2020 has taught me invaluable lessons in life. Mum’s sudden bypass surgery was a wake up call to - Never procrastinate in showing love. Never take anything/ anyone for granted. Mum’s unwavering faith in Christ and her positive outlook in life, has always been the anchor to the failing moments in my life. This Mother’s Day, I’m most thankful she’s recovering well. 🙏🏻 💕 Albeit it’s advisable for us not to visit at the moment, it’s ok cux we are always a video call away, everyday. ❤️
