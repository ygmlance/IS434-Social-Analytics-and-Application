Circuit breaker Day 34: San Lo Horfun 👍👍 Not a dish I order that frequently, but trusted this stall to not go wrong with the zichar. This san lo horfun had the wok hei, but somehow just not as nice when dabao-ed. Would stick to their fish head beehoon soup!
📍Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee (Balestier)
