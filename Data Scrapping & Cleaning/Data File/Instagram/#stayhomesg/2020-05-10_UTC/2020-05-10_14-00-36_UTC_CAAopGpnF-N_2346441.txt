Day 34 of #circuitbreaker: Wow it’s my 11th Mother’s Day, time flies and this year is one to remember 🥰 The kids baked a heart shape cake with loveeee 💕 I asked them to draw me a card so that I can remember next time when they don’t want me anymore 🤣⁣

To all the wonderful mamas out there, more yelling, more patience, more zen moments to you. Happy Mother’s Day! 😘⁣
