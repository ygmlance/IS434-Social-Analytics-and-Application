It’s not only today, but every day that we should give thanks to the motherly figures in our lives🤱🏻 We wish all mothers a very HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY🥰🥰🥰
.
Also, it’s been a hard time for small, local businesses like us during this #circuitbreakersg. But, we’re very thankful for our Good Folks who’ve been super supportive of us!
.
To show our gratitude, we’ll be giving out special, TGB Thank-you gifts to our most supportive Good Folk each week until CB ends! We’ll dedicate a post to you & DM you your gift, along with our BIG thanks🥰
.
For the first week of May, our most supportive Good Folk goes to... @chen9844!! 🎉🎉🎉 She’s so supportive that in one of her orders, she had a whopping total of 8 TGB Super Bowls, along with many other TGB Goodstuff🤩🙌🙌.
.
These are tough times so we really appreciate every single Good Folk’s support, it really really means a lot to us — You will help us survive through #covid_19 ❤️.
.
From all of us here at TGB, we THANK YOU VERY MUCH🥰 Till we meet again (at the cafe)! Take care, stay safe & Happy Mother’s Day everyone!
