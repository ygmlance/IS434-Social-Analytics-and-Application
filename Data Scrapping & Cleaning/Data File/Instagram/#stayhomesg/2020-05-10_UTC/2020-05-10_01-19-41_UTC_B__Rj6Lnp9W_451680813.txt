Over the next two weeks, we’re spotlighting books that celebrate our Malay friends and neighbours. As part of our Circuit Breaker series, we hope these books will remind us to be kind, mindful, and encouraging of each other during this Ramadan period. If you already own the books, perhaps you might want to dig out your copies to read again. If you would like to buy your own copies or purchase for a friend, you can order it via our WhatsApp. (Link in bio.)
