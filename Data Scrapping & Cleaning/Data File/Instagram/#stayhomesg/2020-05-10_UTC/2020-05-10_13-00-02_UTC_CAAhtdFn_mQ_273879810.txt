If there is one homemade dish that i can’t afford to screw up, it has to be the Hakka’s “yam abacus seed”, often a celebrated dish during festive period. 
Always remember time spent kneading the yam mixed dough with my parents in the kitchen; and with dad frying up traditionally with cuttlefish, minced pork, black fungus and dried shrimp. 
When I attempted this dish myself, it resonate with me my dad’s patience and his likeness. Every yam dough kneaded reminds every bit of my memories of him. Starting to stir fry with the combination with achieving as close as dad’s version, even though it slightly deviates, without the cuttlefish.
Its my second attempt today and it will not be the last. Told myself every future attempt will always the best i bring out to the plate. 
And i think mum is going to be proud of me carrying on my dad’s legacy.
