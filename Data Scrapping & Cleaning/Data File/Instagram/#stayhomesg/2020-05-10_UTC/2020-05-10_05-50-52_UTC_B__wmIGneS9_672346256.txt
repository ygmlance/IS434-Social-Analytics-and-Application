I’m sure everyone has spent much of their time whipping up meals during this #circuitbreaker period and I am no exception. Need some colour in my life during this  #stayhomesg period so dinner of Rainbow 🌈 rice inspired by @paulineanghh 
Pairing it with roast pork, not striking but taste is 😋 Thanks @irisleeying for e recipe. 
Stay safe everyone and 3 more wks to go #fighting 💪🏼 #Saturday #onedishmeal #rainbowrice
