It was also Dad’s 👨🏻‍🦳 Birthday as well in the next couple of days and since we couldn’t get to celebrate together this year as a family, I got up early to make Mum & Dad’s Favourite Glutinous Rice topped with Homemade Shallots to have it packed and sent to them ❤️👩🏻‍🍳🍚⁣ @finestfoodsg ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Accompanied with an @awfullychocolatesg cake 🍰 which arrived at their place last evening. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Only Wish for them is to Stay Healthy & Happy! 😄⁣⁣
As the saying goes, “健康就是财富”! 😘⁣⁣⁣
