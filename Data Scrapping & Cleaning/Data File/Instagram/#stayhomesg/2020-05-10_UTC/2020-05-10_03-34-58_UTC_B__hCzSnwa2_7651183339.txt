“Sometimes at the stall, very busy, but I will get a message from my son asking if I have eaten. He has really grown up and understands everything we go through. We are so close,” – Mdm Ayesha.⁣

In addition to waking up at daily at 5am to prepare for the stall’s work ahead, she also prepares breakfast and lunch for her son and husband. Mdm Ayesha and her husband, who run Suka Ramai Mama Power, are among the hawkers preparing food for vulnerable communities in need through Wok the Talk Project. ⁣

We want to thank all amazing mothers like Mdm Ayesha for the incredible work they do behind-the-scenes to keep the family going. You are truly noble! Happy Mothers’ Day!⁣
