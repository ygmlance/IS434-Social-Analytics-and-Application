Quick brew before class starts. I usually don’t brew at home because I leave most of my gear at school. I decided to bring them home just after the circuit breaker measures were announced - Figured it’s time to find some space at home for all the toys. 
Interestingly, I’m still drinking more tea than coffee. How’s your weekend going? It’s a brand new week soon!
