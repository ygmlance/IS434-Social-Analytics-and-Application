Motherhood, a journey that has often turned my life upside down, given me plenty of sleepless nights and messy hair days along the way (lucky no white hair yet but I am sure the day is coming soon!) but also one that has provided me with countless happy memorable moments and laughter in the house.

This Mother’s Day, Matty (and daddy) gave me a hand painted shiny Exeggcute (if you play Pokémon too you will know what this is) and the hubs promised to watch CLOY with me tonight onwards ✌️ (yes, we are super late to the game I know).
.
Happy Mother’s Day everyone! Hope it was an awesome one for you ❤️
