!PROGRAMME RESHUFFLE KLAXON!
We will be making a few changes to our programme! @edksch will stand in for @fortykilos on SIMPLE SUNDAY. But no worries if you miss Rebecca’s antics because she’ll be back tomorrow for MELODY MONDAY! So catch them both over the next few days on IG LIVE!
.
.
Oh and if you guys are wondering why we are doing IG LIVE instead of the usual FB LIVE for these two programmes, the reason is due to copyrights issue surrounding the songs we play on air!
.
.
Further more, we’ll be doing a reshuffle of our weekly programme so stay tune to the unveiling tomorrow!
