Note to self: You are not giving me a hard time, you are having one.
Every tantrum gives us the chance to grow and learn.
Every tear we wipe away together, help put hurdles into perspective and be stronger. 
Thank you for being who you are and making me who I am.

I am stressed yet blessed!

Happy mom life! ♥️
