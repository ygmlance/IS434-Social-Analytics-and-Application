Yesterday's lunch satisfied my craving for laksa for sure. Usually my laksa affair is very simple, just a bowl of thick bee hoon with the usual shredded chicken meat, tau pok and fish cake slices will do.

But this laksa steamboat set from @sanlaksa was extravagant! With lots of ingredients that lasted our family through to dinner lor! The dumplings and fish paste were delicious and the gravy was great!

You can order the set from https://www.sanlaksa.com.sg/set-menu and they say you get 10% + free delivery if you quote [ThePerfectFather]. So yeah, enjoy the food and discount ya?
