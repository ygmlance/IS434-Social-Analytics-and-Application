Chocolate Wacky Cake!

Itâ€™s probably wacky because of the simple ingredients used, and the way to make it!

It uses flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, sugar, distilled white vinegar, oil, vanilla and water to make the batter!

I paired the cake with American buttercream for a taste of nostalgia! 
Wishing everyone a Happy Motherâ€™s Day, and you might want to try making this cake today! ðŸ’–
