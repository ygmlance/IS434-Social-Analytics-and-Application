Babi Hong

Babi Hong ( Braised Pork Belly )

Babi Hong, one of Indonesian Chinese dishes, is pork braised in dark soy sauce.

Hokkien food, also called ‚ÄúHong Bak‚Äù or ‚ÄúLoh Bak‚Äù. I called my Mum, how to cook this dishes, she explained to me how to cook and how to make the sauce.

Finally I made it for first time and the Taste is the same like my mum did. 
I hope by doing this, she will feel the appreciation from her son, as actually house work like cooking is not simple things to do.
Thanks Mum

It's a good time to call her during this International mothers day. 
I like this dishes, as since young she cooked this for us, and one of my favourite dishes. 
As a child I believe all like our mother's cook style, as those dishes are our comfort food.

Today, maybe we can call our parent, just spend some time talking to them, especially in this #stayathome period. 
Make them feel not lonely... Lucky to have family to support, hahaha kitchen very messy :) thanks my wife and children 
I did not believe I can make it, but my wife said, you never try you never know
