When the husband cooks, one's gotta support whole heartedly right? Haha. Dinner last night was nasi lemak! Yesterday was a happy non low-carb day for sure. Haha.ðŸ˜‹
If you wanna keep it low carb, just skip the rice! The chicken, prawns & ladies fingers were marinated in coocnut milk, lemongrass, curry powder, paprika, fish sauce, red onions blended together. .
