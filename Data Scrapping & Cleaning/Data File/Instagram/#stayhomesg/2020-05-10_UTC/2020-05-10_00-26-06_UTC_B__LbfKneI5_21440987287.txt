To all the super mummies...
.
As mothers, we often feel that we are not doing enough, even if every waking moment is spent doing our best for the family.⁠
.⁠
Esp. after harsh words to the little ones that is needed at times, or the occasional uncontrolled outbursts to maintain our sanity.⁠
.⁠
No matter how much you feel like you can do better, know that you are already doing the best you can. And most importantly, you are the world to your family.⁠
.⁠
Happy Mother's Day to all the beautiful mothers in the world.⁠ You are amazing.
