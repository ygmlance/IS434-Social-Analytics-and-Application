Tried making this oat crusted egg tart using only 4 ingredients! Found this receipe on facebook hahaha and it turn out not bad ? 
The crust tasted like oats pancake (so its kinda on a chewy side) and the custard there's not much taste to it as no sugar was added. Generally a healthier egg tart and you could taste the "healthy" taste HAHA I think it would fit the palatte of those who are light on their tastebud (like me!) .

Ingredients (makes about 6 tarts):
3 mashed bananas
Oats 
1 egg
60ml milk (I used soymilk instead)

1. Combine the mashed bananas with oats until its kinda dough like texture (not too wet)
2. Butter/oil the tart mould and spread the abovementioned bananaoats dough to form the tart
3. Beat one egg and add the milk. And sieve the custard mixture
4. Pour in the mixture to the tart and bake at 200-210degcelsius for about 25mins or until alil brown is shown. (I increase the temperature in the last 5mins to get the "brown" effect)
