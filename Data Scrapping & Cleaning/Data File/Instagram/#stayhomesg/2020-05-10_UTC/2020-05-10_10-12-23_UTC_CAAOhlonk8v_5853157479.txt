Today is a Special Mother's Day.Thanks for my daughter for taking part in KFC Mother's day Contest.  N she had won me a KFC Mother's day feast dinner. Thanks for the delivery guy that delivered on time so that we can have a early dinner. Thanks KFC too. Because of the Circuit Breaker, we can't dine out as usual for a Hotel Buffet. But we still can enjoy our feast at home safely.
