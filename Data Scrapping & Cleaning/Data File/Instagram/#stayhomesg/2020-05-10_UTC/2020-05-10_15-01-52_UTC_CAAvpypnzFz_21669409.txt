Happy Mother's Day to all the awesome mommies! ❤️ As for us, we had simple home cooked food for dinner. Ordered lunch and a mother's day pumpkin brioche for mom. We also had our donuts, bread and basic DIY decorations set delivered today. We had fun decorating it too. 🥳 Received handmade cards from my two lovely girls. 🥰 Not forgetting some jamon and 🍷 to end the day.. haha.. So how did you celebrate your mother's day? #mothersday #celebrationathome #stayhomesg #videocalls
