Chill guys. This is not a new baby. It’s a throwback to 2016 when I became a mother. It’s Mother’s Day and we’ve been apart for 5 weeks now due to me contracting the naughty #covid19 But they say parting makes you tough. I guess through this, i wouldnt have thought this mummy’s boy could do so well without me around. I can finally make some solo traveling plans (when this ever blows over)! 😃 #justsaying Thank God for the gift of technology, we are able to do video calls. Can’t wait for the day we be reunited. But for now, mama’s taking a long break from the hustle and bustle of life and gona come out restored and stronger 💪🏻 Thanks boys for the donuts and handmade card. They are well received!

Happy Mother’s Day to all you amazing supermums out there!
