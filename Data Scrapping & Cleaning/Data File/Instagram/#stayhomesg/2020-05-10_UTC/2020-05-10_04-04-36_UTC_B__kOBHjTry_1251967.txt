FLUFFY EGG CLOUD TOAST?!
Decided to make some cafe food for this week #CBfoodieSG because the theme is AVOCADO! All you need to make the Insta-worthy EGG CLOUD TOAST is an  EGG and I decided to add a variation with avocado since it‚Äôs also common in cafe food!
.
Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Separate the egg yolk and egg white. 1 egg for 1 toast
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add some lime (optional) and whisk the egg white 1000 times, similar to the 1000 times Souffl√© Omelette i posted earlier
3Ô∏è‚É£ Use a spoon you scoop some beaten egg white into a toast. I‚Äôm using @BakerAndCookSG Soy & Linseed Sourdough (SGD 7.50) available in selected Cold Storage and Market Place by Jasons outlets.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Gently place the Egg Yolk in the middle of the fluffy egg white
5Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-heat oven and place your Toast in the oven for 10mins at 190 degree Celsius
6Ô∏è‚É£ The Fluffy Egg Toast with a runny egg yolk is now ready to serve! You can garnish it with some avocado and berries
