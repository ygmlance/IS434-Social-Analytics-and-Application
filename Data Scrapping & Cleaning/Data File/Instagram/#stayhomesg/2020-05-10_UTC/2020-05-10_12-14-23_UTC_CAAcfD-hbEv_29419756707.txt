I turn 8 months old today! 🎊🤗 It was a double celebration for my mama’s first Mother’s Day too, with the prettiest Wild Berry pie from @elijahpies 🥰
.
Have not stepped out of the home for four weeks now, and I can’t wait to head out for sunshine! 🌤 .
Meanwhile my mom would dress me up like this every other day, because I’m bursting out of my pretty clothes soon... 🙊🤷🏻‍♀️ #babymilestone #babiesbloggers
