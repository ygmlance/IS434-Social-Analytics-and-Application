Kam’s Roast collaborates with Joy Luck Teahouse so we can now can our roast meat and HK style Bubble Milk Tea all in one order. The bubble tea is unlike our tw bbtea, it’s the Hk Cha Chan Teng milk tea and the tea is quite gao and not overly sweet, the way I like. I added Marine Collagen to my milk tea, it didn’t taste fishy. 
Joy Luck Teahouse is targeted to open in the 3rd Quarter of 2020. #KamRoastSG #JoyLuckTeaHouse #HKmilktea #bubbleteasg
