"Mothers" 
Someone who may not be perfect,
Someone who will make mistakes, 
Someone who always tired but still keep going,
Someone who always worried but still keep hope alive 
Someone who may wake up earliest n the last to go to bed in the family,
Someone who may also struggles with her own problems, 
But she is also 
Someone who will love and care for you unconditionally til her last breath
.
.
To all the supermoms out there 
Happy Mother's Day! 
You are doing great! 
Take a breather n enjoy the day
