I was a bit reluctant to get out of bed this morning because 1. I was tired 😴 from looking after needy Lucien all night and 2. I could hear lots of crying and tantrum throwing going on outside my bedroom. (I already had to deal with Arielle's temper tantrum earlier at 7.30am)
.
Decided to get up from bed, wash up and put on my 1 minute @saborinosg facial mask as I felt I deserved a little bit of pampering today. Arielle got a shock when she saw me and said I look like a monster 😈, but I corrected her and said I am a "Mom-ster".
.
She kept muttering "today is your special day" (no doubt something planted into her head by her daddy) and she suddenly presented me with this craft! I was pleasantly surprised as I honestly didn't think anyone would bother doing anything for Mother's Day (as is usually the case).
.
My Mother's Day is starting to look a little more pleasant now... Hope all you fellow mums have a pleasant and peaceful day too! ❤💐🍫 (sorry, no bbt emoticon)
