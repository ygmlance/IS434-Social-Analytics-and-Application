Happy Mother’s Day!💐
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Valerie was rushing in and out of the room when I woke up this morning. Each time carrying several items that she then arranged on the table 🍽
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
First the doughnut that we made yesterday. She filled and smeared it with Ovomaltine.
Next, a cup of milk 🥛 and the flowers💐
Lastly, the cards and daddy’s phone to play the background music 🎼🎼
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
They woke up at 5.30am to prepare this for me 🥰
Thank you children! Mama love you!💕
