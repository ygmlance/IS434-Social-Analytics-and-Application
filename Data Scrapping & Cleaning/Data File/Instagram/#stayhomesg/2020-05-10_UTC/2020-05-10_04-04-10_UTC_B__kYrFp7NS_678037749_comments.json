Why is there no notification provided when the rider cancelled the order due to overwhelming orders at the merchant? Didn't even realised we have to be on standby on the app to make sure we get the order - if so, then what is the point of pre-order? We waited in vain, and a full refund is truly the bare minimum you can do. Grab officially ruined Mother's Day for us. The notification/alert system needs to be improved.",

Ordered at around 1740hrs \u2018cos we expected delays for food due to Mothers\u2019 Day, driver was kind enough to inform us about possible delay as he had stack orders. However, after an hour long wait, the food was still not ready and rider had to cancel so as not to delay other orders and he assured me that Grab will dispatch another rider to pick up the food order if he cancels. BUT grab cancelled my entire order after more than an hour long wait instead of getting another rider to fulfil it, and their hotline does not work at all! This order was meant for my aged grandparents who doesn\u2019t live with us, & it was meant as a Mother\u2019s Day surprise. Thank you Grab for leaving my grandparents hungry & ruining our Mother\u2019s Day.",
