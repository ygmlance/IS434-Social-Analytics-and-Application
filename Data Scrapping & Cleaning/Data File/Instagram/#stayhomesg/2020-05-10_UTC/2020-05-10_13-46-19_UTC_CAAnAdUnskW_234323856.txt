When asked if we should put the little one to sleep first before enjoying her Mother’s Day meal, this wonderful woman said “Let her join us, I wouldn’t be a mother without her!” Thank you for taking care of our little hatchling, especially during this period when I’m away at the frontline. 
Happy Mother’s Day❤️ We had a well curated selection by @chef_julien @odetterestaurant during this period. The team’s impeccable attention to packaging, cards, and of course, ingredients deserves to be mentioned. Finishing instructions were precise and I had all the fun plating every dish. 
Menu Du Jour 
1. White Asparagus ‘Mimosa’ - Loire Valley white asparagus, buckwheat blinis, ‘crème’ Aigrelette

2. Hokkaido Uni ‘Pain Perdu’ - beurre noisette, finger lime, yuzu 
3. Blue Lobster & Kinki Bouillabaisse - fennel, confit garlic, saffron Grenaille potatoes

4. Pithivier ‘Grande Cuisine’ - pigeon, foie gras, Bresse chicken, sauce Pèrigueux, pommes gourmande, Kombu salad

5. Canelé - I added an additional element by spraying homemade vanilla “perfume” on the interior of the glass, allowing the scent of vanilla to permeate the air when the bell is lifted
