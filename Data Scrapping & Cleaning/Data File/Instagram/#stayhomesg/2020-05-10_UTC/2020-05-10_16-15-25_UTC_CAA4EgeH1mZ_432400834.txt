Baby wrote and composed a “song” for me. Thank you my babies for the handmade card and flower. Even Keira also tried her best to draw something. Haha! Ended my Mother’s Day in 全民 ktv with the family!! Got my kids along with their cousins to share the gift for their grandmothers and great-grandmothers. I just broke Keisha’s piggy bank. 😅 She better return to school soon to save her allowances again. Happy Mother’s Day to all mummies out there! Every mummies are wonderful in their unique ways!! #stayhomesg #dressupathome #mothersday2020 @admnory
