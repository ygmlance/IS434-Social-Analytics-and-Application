CB - Day 34, 10 May 2020, dinner
Got this comment out of the blue..."Hey, it's been a long time since you last made that fried chicken with curry leaves!" Well, the hub is right, I've not cooked this for at least 4 or 5 years! This is amongst other hand written recipes which I've "forgotten", ever since I started documenting recipes digitally. 
Hence, I revisited this recipe today and found it to be an accurate one. So here's sharing with you Annie's popcorn chicken...haha ðŸ¤£

Marinate for at least 2 hours:
3 skin on chicken thighs, cut into 6 pieces per thigh
Â½ tsp soy sauce
Â½ tsp salt
Â¼ tsp sugar
1 clove of garlic, grated
1 small snob of ginger, grated for juice

4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
3 sprigs of curry leaves
3 chilli padi, sliced
2 sprigs of spring onion, fine sliced
1 tsp Sichuan pepper salt (recipe below)

Tapioca flour (for coating)
Oil (for deep frying)

Lightly coat chicken with tapioca flour. Heat oil, deep fry chicken till golden brown. Drain and set aside.

Pour out most of the oil, leaving about 1-1.5 tbsp of oil in the pan. Put in chopped garlic and start frying on low heat. When the garlic starts to turn yellow and has reduced in volume, add in curry leaves and chilli. Continue on low heat till garlic is lightly golden. Add in chicken and sprinkle over Sichuan pepper salt and spring onion. Mix well. Serve up.

Homemade Sichuan pepper salt:
1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns
3 tbsp coarse sea salt
Dry roast in a pan over low heat till peppercorns become aromatic. Transfer into a shallow plate, to cool down quickly. Grind into powder using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. I keep this in the fridge indefinitely.
