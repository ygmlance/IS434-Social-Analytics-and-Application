Happy Mother’s Day to all mummies. Stay home or not, boring or not, it is depend on how we see and celebrate it. I am just happy to have Leodys and my loved ones with me. Thank you my hubby @larenspace for getting my favourite food, Sashimi and Sushi, for Mother’s Day. We tried out from @hokkaivilla, came abit late but food came fresh and chilled. Each platter was packed with dry ice. Thank you my sister @andln8 for the Mini Steam Nutella Cake from @littlesweettoothbakes. Leodys loved the cars cake and I loved the filling, Nutella! Will consider getting it for kids party in the future. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #happymothersday #mothersday #2ndmothersday #sushi #sushilovers #steamcake #nutellasteamcake #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #hangonsunz
