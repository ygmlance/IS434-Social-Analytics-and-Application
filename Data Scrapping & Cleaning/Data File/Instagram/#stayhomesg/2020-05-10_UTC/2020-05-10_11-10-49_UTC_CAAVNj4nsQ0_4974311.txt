[08.05.20] Day 32 of #circuitbreaker:

I think my kids are totally enjoying the time they get to stay at home. Unless ABSOLUTELY necessary (read: parentsâ€™ orders aka bo bian), they would rather stay at home than go for a car ride (without having to alight) to collect our takeaways. So the only time they leave the house is when I, too have to leave the house as well to pass food or some necessities to my parents. 
Note: no cause for alarm here - they wear their masks when we leave the house, get into the car and before they alight as well.
