Brunch as usual! 🥞🍳And I get to enjoy it in the comfy threads of @susyandbae. 🥰
We have all been staying home for more than a month! Woohoo👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 ! Who would have imagined that we could all stay home like this. 
Staying home messes up and convolutes my days and I find that keeping to a different routine for weekdays and weekends help to keep that balance I need to keep sane. Over weekends, I cook up more elaborate meals and take the time to savour them, baking sweet treats and tending to my houseplants. Simple things that calms the mind and soothes the soul. What is your new found #stayhome routine?
