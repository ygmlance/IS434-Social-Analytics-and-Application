Here's what goes behind the We The Hawkers delivery scene every morning... After getting all the food ready, we send out reminder texts to our customers to inform them of their delivery / pickup scheduled for the day, assigned the routes to our drivers, write sticker labels and start packing every box of biryani, meats, and sides with ❤️ love.

We always try to place the food in styrofoam boxes to help retain the heat. So when the drivers arrived, they will go through the orders again to make sure everything is correct before heading out.

Once our drivers are on the road 🚗, we will send out a text to inform our customers that their delivery is on the way and another text to thank them after drivers had dropped off the items.

This is a system we created to help facilitate our deliveries smoothly for everyone involved. 👏🏼 Thank you for praising us for our service and our food quality!

It has been a hectic month for us during the circuit breaker period but we are not complaining. In fact, we are grateful 🙏🏼 for all the help and support received! Thank you all! 😄
