Don't be surprised if you see a 4-legged robot patrolling in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.

Called Spot, the robot will be broadcasting a recorded message reminding park visitors to observe safe distancing measures.

Don't worry about bumping into Spot as it is fitted with safety sensors to detect objects and people within 1m to avoid collision.

Robots can observe safe distancing too! ðŸŽ¥: Gin Tay
