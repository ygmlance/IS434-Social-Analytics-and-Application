Day 34 into the circuit breaker. .
Happy mother's day. I am living in Singapore while parent are living in Hong Kong. A lot of time we do not celebrate together on the actual mother's day. Here I would like to say thank you to this greatest woman in my life. Your love and care are abundant and unconditional. And we will celebrate together when I visit Hong Kong after the covid-19. .
