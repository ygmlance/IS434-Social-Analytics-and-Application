Happy Sunday🤗~~ reliving the old memories of tokyo sando through this homemade mayo-free tamago sando made with @bakerandcooksg soy and linseed sourdough sliced bread, shoyu wasabi and @barkersofgeraldine beetroot relish. It’s an egg bomb with 4 eggs in total 👻 but the end result is a truly satisfying one

The breads are available from selected @coldstoragesg and Jason Marketplace outlets. [Recipe] 
2 slices of @bakerandcooksg soy and linseed sourdough 🍞 
4 boiled eggs 🥚 
Shoyu or any soy sauce 
Leftover Wasabi (according to own preference) 
1/3 Japanese cucumber 🥒 
4 pcs of Iceberg lettuce 🥬 
@barkersofgeraldine Beetroot Relish (available from @bakerandcooksg) 
1. Toast the bread
2. Boil 4 eggs. 
3. Mash 2 eggs with fork and mixed with 2 Tbsp of beetroot relish. Add a little salt to taste if you find it too sweet 
4. For bread spread: mix shoyu and wasabi to your liking 
5. Optional : microwave the iceberg lettuce (you can leave that raw if u wish) 
6. Assemble: spread the toasts with shoyu wasabi and layer as toast > iceberg lettuce> beetroot mashed egg > 2 boil eggs > sliced cucumber> toast 
7. Use cling wrap, aluminium foil or parchment paper (whichever u have) to wrap the sandwich. Compressing a little 
8. Set in fridge for 30min to set before slicing them in half. Or u can just straightaway Itadakimasu! *Feel free to adjust the components of the sandwich as u wish •
