Regrowing #vegetablescraps is one of those defining #lockdown activities. Definitely easier than making dalgona coffee, bread, or yeast (although I do plan to embark on the last one).

While this isn’t any form of food security (more than 3 weeks to grow this batch which ended up in my tummy in just 3 meals), there is a small wonder in seeing new life sprout from would-be discards and a pleasure in consuming homegrown nourishment. 🖐🌱🌱🌱🤚.

Just found out today is also #GardenDay! Happy to celebrate it, with my tiny space of greenery & greens.

Tagging #StayHomeWithAscott, for #CapitaLandHopeFoundation to pledge US$10 to @SaveTheChildren. Each tag is CHF’s pledge to support underprivileged kids affected by COV-19.
