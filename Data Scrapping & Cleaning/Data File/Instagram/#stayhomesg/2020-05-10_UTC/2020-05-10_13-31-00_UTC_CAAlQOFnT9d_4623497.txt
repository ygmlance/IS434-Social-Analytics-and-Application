A first-ever for all of us.... Mother’s Day celebration at home. Very bittersweet - I couldn’t even celebrate properly with MY mum (video call over dinner having food from the same restaurant was the best we could get), and yet, it was really nice to spend a lazy day at home with the kids.

Chris walked out to get our favourite @deckerbarbecue meats, and a fantastic @wineconnectionsg, paired with champagne 🥂

And dinner was Japanese... something we haven’t had in weeks!

I got “sooooo many cuddles” (in Chloe’s words) this morning, and sweet hand-written love letters from my boys. My heart is full 💖

So many mums struggling trying to hold their families (and their own sanity) together. So many grandmas alone without their kids or grandkids to celebrate with.

So this Mother’s Day, wishing you a blessed and meaningful one... filled with all the joy in the small things! 💐
