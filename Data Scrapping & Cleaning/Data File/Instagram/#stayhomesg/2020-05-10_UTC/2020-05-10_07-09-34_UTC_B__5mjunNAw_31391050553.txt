Happy Mother’s Day to all the 🧑🏻Mothers out there!

This year, I made my mom Carrot Cake (first ever ‘official’ cake I’ve made, and yay to no more store bought cakes) ugly and messy.. 🍰totally what I was going for.

It was pretty yums, 😌could do more with more cream, but overall it’s really good hehe was super impressed with it.

Perfect for dessert after our DTF inspired Fried Rice 🍚 cooked by my brother 😋
