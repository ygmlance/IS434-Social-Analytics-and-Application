Happy Mother’s Day to all the Super moms out there! Including my grandma & granny in heaven. Kitchen is closed today therefore food delivery for dinner. Tried ah tan’s wings and they are really delicious! Ordered my fav liho earl grey milk tea and gong yuan mala soup. Super pretty jelly agar cake gifted by neighbour. Happy tummy and my heart is very full. .
