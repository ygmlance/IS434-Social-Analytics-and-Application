My Main Dish for lunch today ! 
N I overheard them while they were prepping the ingredients instructing each other what to do 😂😅
Cooking was made easy for them as they are using readymade Laksa paste from @dancingchef_sg . Isabella just need to put in the paste and the daddy does the combining of the bee hoon with the ingredients. 
Really fast & convenient and it really does tastes very yummy 😋👍🏻 I won’t go to the extend to make the paste from scratch unless I have big family or you can just say #iamjustlazy This is good enough to satisfy my cravings once in a while ♥️👍🏻 #mothersday
