To all mummies: you are enough ❤️
.

🧡 Even when the kids are behind on home-based learning and you just can’t keep up, you are enough.
💛 Even when you’re preparing the second microwaveable meal of the day, you are enough.
💚 Even when the kids are still in their pyjamas and only got showered once a day, you are enough.
💙 Even when the kitchen sink is piled with dirty dishes and Mount Laundry threatens to topple, you are enough.
💜 Even when you question yourself for the 10th time today if you should have stayed home or continued working, you are enough.

Motherhood is difficult - all of us face different challenges and it’s hard is so many different ways. But trust that you are always enough for your children. They are more forgiving than you think!

A couple of days ago I placed @ryanelroydraws in the time-out corner after he did something unacceptable (if you must know, pm me 🤪). He started crying and I didn’t say anything but just sat down with him at the time-out corner. Much later, he came up to me and said: “Mummy, you love me right? Because when I time out you sit down with me.” I almost melted by his ability to perceive love without words or touch ❤️

Also, I made another thing!! 🤪It’s a clay brooch hand painted with acrylic paints (swipe to see). Today’s wonky illustration is based off this clay brooch painting I did :D this clay thingie will be gifted to my beautiful mum @qiaoyinyvonne later today! .

Happy Mother’s Day, fellow mummies of the world! 🥰
