To my little Carrick and unborn child, Mummy will always be your heartbeat, for I’ll be there wherever you are. 
Both of you are my best gifts in my life and I have no other wishes for this Mother’s Day other than praying for your good health.

A blessed 3rd Mother’s Day to myself and wishing all the Moms a “Happy Mother’s Day!” Thanks @flipforjoybookstore for sending us the Chinese books and reading them together with my little Carrick is the most memorable and meaningful to spend this special day!
