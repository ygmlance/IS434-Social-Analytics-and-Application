It’s been more than a month since we closed after my confinement and due to Covid-19 we decided to close another month further till 1 June when the circuit break period is over. .
We were once thought we can make it for this Mother’s Day but for safety & health reason We decided to stay home this critical period.
.
To all the moms to be and Mommies, blessed Mom’s day. ♥️ Your smile makes me happy and your love is the purest emotion I have ever felt in my life. Love you mommy ♥️
. 
Stay safe and healthy everyone we believe we all will get through this hardship together ♥️
