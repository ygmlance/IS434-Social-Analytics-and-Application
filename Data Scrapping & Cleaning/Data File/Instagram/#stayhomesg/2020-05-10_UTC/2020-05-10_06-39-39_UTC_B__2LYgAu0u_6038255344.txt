(Not so) Pastels #amigurumay2020 #amiguruMAY 
When we were told to stay home, I ordered a random bunch of yarn - consisting of primary colors and a lot of petal peach/nude color. I was just going to make my little twin stars and see what else comes along. Who knew... All these bunch of friends showed up 🎉👯👯‍♂️
🕺🕺🏼💃💃🤸‍♀️ I m feeling thankful for my yarn stash. 😆😆 Stay healthy, stay safe, stay sane.💪 ♥️♥️♥️
