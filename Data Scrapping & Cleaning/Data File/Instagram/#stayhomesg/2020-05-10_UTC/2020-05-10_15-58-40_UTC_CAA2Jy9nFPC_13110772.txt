PG Week 1

First time on PG HBL, R was stunned because she didnâ€™t get to see her usual teachers. We did a variety of crafts this week such as ice painting, finger print art and teacher taught us how to make a drum! We also had some water beads sensory play which became smashing beads instead ðŸ˜‚
