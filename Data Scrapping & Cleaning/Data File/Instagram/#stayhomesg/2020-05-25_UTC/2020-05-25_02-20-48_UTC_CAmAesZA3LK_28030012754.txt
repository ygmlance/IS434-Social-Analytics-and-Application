❗️Why is it recommended to exfoliate only 2-3x a week ? 
Exfoliating every day can strip the skin of its natural oils, which can cause breakouts. It can also cause irritation because you're removing the top layer of skin before it can heal. So for normal skin, exfoliate 2-3x a week will do! ❤️ #elluresg #elluretomatobubblemask #tomatomaskcleanser #exfoliatingmask #bubblemask #cleanse #facemask #foammask #facialsg #stayhomemask #stayhomesg
