"Be stubborn about your goals, and flexible about your methods." For me being flexible means, if I start something like a workout/challenge and it doesn't spark joy. It's ok to quit that and find something that I enjoy. Why carry on doing something that makes me miserable 🤷🏻. If I can't figure out what yet then I dance until I do 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻😆
