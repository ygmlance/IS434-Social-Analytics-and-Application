#MalaMonday! Starting the week with one of my favorite item from @kudos.sg – spicy mala chicken with furikake garlic rice and lava egg.

The boneless chicken thigh is marinated with special mala spices and grilled to perfection, not overly spicy and paired well with fragrant garlic rice.

If mala isn’t your cup of tea, you can customize your own chicken bowl or choose from their best selling mains and sides.
