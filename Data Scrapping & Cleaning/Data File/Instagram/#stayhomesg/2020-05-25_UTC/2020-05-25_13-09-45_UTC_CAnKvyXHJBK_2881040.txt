Spent the last few weeks experimenting with sourdough loaves, so going really simple today with Shiopan & ham and cheese rounds! ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹ for breakfast tmr.

They are so yummy but so ugly ğŸ˜£ coz I was making them alongside prepping for dinner! Definitely tempting to eat them at this hour!ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #sgparent #homecooking #sghomecooks #sginstagfood #sgbakes #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday49
