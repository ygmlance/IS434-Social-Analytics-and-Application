Good afternoon, everyone. I hope that everyone is safe and cooking up a storm in the kitchen again today.

I will be sharing another Nyonya soup which is only prepared during festive occasions, especially during Chinese New Year.

But times have changed as the various combination of ingredients are very affordable by today's living standards.  This soup can also be made any time of the year as a one dish meal for your family.
