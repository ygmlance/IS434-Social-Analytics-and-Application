It's back to the grind tomorrow for some of us. As we head out let's remember to be careful and considerate by taking that Hand-y Sanitizer along. Let's fight this together Singapore! DM to get yours now!

ECULYPTUS, TEA TREE & SWEET ORANGE. 
Misting saves more so it'll last way longer than your usual run ons and you can use a safe amount each time. 
Easy to carry with you, lightweight, leak proof and looks sleek.

This mixture ensures that bacterias and germs are killed as soon as you spray it on your hands. It has antibacterial properties.

It will not dry out your hands and cause flaking like with regular santizers due to usage. Leaves your hands clean and pleasant.
