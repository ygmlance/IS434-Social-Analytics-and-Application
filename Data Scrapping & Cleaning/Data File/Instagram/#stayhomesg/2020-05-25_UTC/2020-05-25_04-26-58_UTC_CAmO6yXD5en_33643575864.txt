Curious about art therapy? Join our conversation with Joyce Lee and Joshua Tan next Saturday, 4PM (SGT) about how art can be used as therapy to heal and foster mental well-being.

Joyce Lee is a calligrapher and entrepreneur. She is known by her pen name, @artsynibs, in the calligraphy world and runs Artsynibs Studio which she founded in Manchester, UK. When sheâ€™s not leading a calligraphy course, Joyce works with a wide range of both Singaporean and European clients on various creative campaigns with a calligraphic twist. 
A former art facilitator and graphic designer from Singapore, Josh (@justjoshtan) has a depth of experience in using art to work in the community. Currently based in the United Kingdom, he is due to complete his postgraduate training in Art Therapy in mid-2020. 
For the past two years, Josh has been embedded in England's National Health Service (NHS), providing art therapy for adolescents and adults with a range of mental health struggles, including depression, eating disorders and psychosis. An adult Third Culture Kid (TCK) and two-time TEDx speaker, he is particularly passionate about accessible art and cross-cultural communication.
