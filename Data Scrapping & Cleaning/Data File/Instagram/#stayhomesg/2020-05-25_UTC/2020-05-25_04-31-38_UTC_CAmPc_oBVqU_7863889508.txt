Simple seafood porridge boiled with dried scallops, filled with prawns, fish and topped with spring onions, ginger garnish. Stirring the porridge continuously over low flame over an hour to achieve that milky thick gravy like texture. Just like grandma used to cook. #congee #riceporridge #scallops #prawns #milky #richtexture #stayhomesg #singapore #homemade #foodsgrandmausedtomake #白粥 #白里透红 #海鲜粥
