#nofilter needed for my first successful protein "artisanal" bread bake! This was a recipe I just decided to trial by myself, adjusting the dough consistency according to my experiences with the previous regular flour breads. That's the reason why I'm AMAZED at how it was such a success!!!! I'm super in love! 
Packing a 7.5g protein per (HUGE) slice, I'm definitely delighted! 
I used @myproteinsg hokkaido milk whey protein powder, which gave it a hint of milk bread taste! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
