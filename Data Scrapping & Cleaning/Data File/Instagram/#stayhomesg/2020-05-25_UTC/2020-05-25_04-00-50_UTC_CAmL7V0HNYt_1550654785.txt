Have you guessed it right! Made from freshly-brewed Cheng Teng soup and comes with longan pieces, this new twist of our local-inspired Cheng Teng Ai-Yu dessert is a cooling treat especially for this humid climate. If you prefer a lighter and fruity flavour, try the Cheng Teng Ai-Yu A. For more traditional toppings, go for Cheng Ai-Yu B. Valid at all Nine Fresh outlets, from 25 May - 30 June for just $3 (U.P. $3.80) each.
