A hearty simple dinner. Put the chicken katsu into airfryer. Pan fried beef patty and use another pan to fry egg at the same time. Boil the Japanese curry (with the packer) for 3-5mins. Cooked rice, arrange the sides and pour the Japanese curry (comes with carrots, potatoes and onions) on the rice. Simple and warm.
