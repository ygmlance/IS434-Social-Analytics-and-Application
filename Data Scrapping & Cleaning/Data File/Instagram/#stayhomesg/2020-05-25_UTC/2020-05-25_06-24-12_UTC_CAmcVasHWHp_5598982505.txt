Our Tornado OmuRice from Kitchen Of menu has been pretty well received, especially among the kids! But today we decided to add a little twist to it.

Introducing a new addition to Chop Chop Biryani & Meats menu, the Curry OmuRice butâ€¦ with Pork ðŸ¤£

We also started an initiative called #HelpingFellowHawkers where we include other hawker brands on our menu and help deliver their food and drinks. Customers are welcome to place orders from different hawker brands within a single delivery!

Check out menu from Lagoon in a Bowl, Mr. Batang Fish @ 96, Pepper Bowl, and 33 Bean & Juice! Place orders through our online delivery / pickup form today! https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9hVa1jUvLRoHfWV5znmtVR_tO6ORngl8zHClzVOqOJzjVEQ/viewform

More brands will definitely be added soon as we are also working on a website to help facilitate everything efficiently. Stay tuned!
