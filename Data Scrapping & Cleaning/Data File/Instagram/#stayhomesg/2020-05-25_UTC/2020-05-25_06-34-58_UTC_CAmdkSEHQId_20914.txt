A week ago we decided to shave her hair since it was getting longer and kept poking her eyes. Due to the current situation, we did not get to bring her to the hair dresser, we actually plucked up the courage to shave her ourselves instead. Many struggles and some cries here and there that it took us 4 days to get a clean cut. ðŸ¤­Atleast her scalp is clean now!
