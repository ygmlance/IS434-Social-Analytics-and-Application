Our La Crema Gianduia is back in a bigger jar!
An incredibly creamy mouthfeel, coupled with warm nutty aroma and fruity undertone makes it perfect for breakfast as a spread on bread, or just enjoyed by the spoonful. Usually starts off with a little taste off the finger and before you know it, the jar is empty.
Hopefully this bigger jar makes it last a few days more. üåù
