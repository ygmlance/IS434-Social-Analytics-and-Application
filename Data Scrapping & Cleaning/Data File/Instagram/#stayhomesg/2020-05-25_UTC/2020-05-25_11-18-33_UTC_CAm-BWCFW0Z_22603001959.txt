Cat: Did you know that “blue light” aka high-energy visible light (HEV) emitted from electronic devices such as handphones, pc & tv, is as damaging to our skin as sun exposure? Be sure to apply sunblock & moisturiser to protect yourself from these harmful rays even though you are working from home!
