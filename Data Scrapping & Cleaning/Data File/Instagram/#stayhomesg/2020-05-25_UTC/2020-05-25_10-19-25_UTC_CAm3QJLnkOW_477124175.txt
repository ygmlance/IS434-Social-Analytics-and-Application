Running out of things to do with your kids? Or looking for ways to expend their energy?

We have some healthy screen time for them with our brand new programmes.

Kids ActiveMax (8-12 years old)
Youth StrengthMax (13-18 years old)

These sessions (schedule above) will be done 'live' via Zoom; participants will receive a unique link and passcode.

If you would like a customised fitness plan for your child (Youths only), we are able to tailor a programme accordingly, for them to follow at home.

If you're keen to find out more, simply contact us at 81655641 (WhatsApp only) or simply slide into our DM!
