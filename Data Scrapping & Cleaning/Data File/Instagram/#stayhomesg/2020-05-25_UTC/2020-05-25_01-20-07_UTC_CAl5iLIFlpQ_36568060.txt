#stayhomesg “Only grant me these two things, God, and then I will not hide from you:  Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors.  Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply to me.  How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin.  Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?
Job 13:20‭-‬24 NIV
