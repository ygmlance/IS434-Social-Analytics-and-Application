Day 49 dinner.
A simple one with not much preparation as my energy were all used up on my Bee Hoon this morning.
Cook a brown rice mix with barley.
Mixed it with furikake.
Stirred fried the Canned pork ‰∫îÈ¶ôËÇâ‰∏Å with tomatoes & carrots and place on fresh lettuces.
Easy.
This is my first time buying this pork cube.
It was out of stocks during the earlier stage of Circuit breaker.
My mum used to cook with potatoes & tomatoes including the oily sauce during my childhood days.
But i do it the more healthier way. I took it out piece by piece using chopsticks. Throw away the oily sauce. No extra oil added. Just add in the two ingredients, stirred until there is a nice fragrance can serve.üòä #jasmine_homecooked #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithst
