Our Impossible Satay is a delectable vegetarian alternative to our well-loved satays. Here's what the team at @nylonsg had to say about our chargrilled plant-based skewers: "I haven’t had satay for more than two years because I was always dealt a hand of fatty, gamy meat. But still, I caved at the mention of Impossible satay — and boy did it pay off. Served charred to your heart’s desire, the skewers are spiced up with lemongrass, chilli, shallots, coriander and cumin powder. While the soft texture can’t be fully escaped, the trick and beauty of this dish come in the finesse of its caramelised glaze and signature peanut sauce. I scooped up everything, I swear." Impossible Satay is exclusively available from Violet Oon Satay Bar & Grill. Swipe for our full menu. ⁣
