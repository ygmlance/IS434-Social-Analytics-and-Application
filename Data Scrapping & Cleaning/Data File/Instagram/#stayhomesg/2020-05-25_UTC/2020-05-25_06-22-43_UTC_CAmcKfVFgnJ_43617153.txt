Weekend lunch has been good these days. Cooked some soba and made tamagoyaki, agedashi tofu and miso soup.

Awase dashi
To use for Tamagoyaki, Agedashi tofu, and Miso soup.
Do not wash the kombu. Soak 10g of kombu (dried kelp) with 1 liter of water for 2 hours to make cold brew Kombu dashi.
Boil both the kombu and cold brew Kombu dashi over medium low heat to almost boil, around 10 mins.
Remove air bubbles by skimming the surface.
Remove kombu just before the dashi starts boiling. This is to prevent the dashi from turning bitter.
Add 10g of katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) and continue to boil it.
Lower the heat when the dashi is boiling. Simmer for 30 sec before turning off the heat.
Let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom, about 10 mins.
Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl and it is ready to use.
To use it later, cool it before storing it in the fridge and up to 4 days.

Agedashi tofu
Make sauce by boiling 1 cup of Awase dashi, 2 tbsp soy sauce, and 2 tbsp mirin in a small pot. Put it aside.
Peel and grate daikon. Cut green onion. These would be used for toppings later.
Wrap tofu with paper towels to drain the water.
Cut it into 8 cube pieces.
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium high heat till 175C.
Coat the tofu with cornstarch and remove excess flour.
Deep fry the tofu till light brown and crispy.
Let the tofu rest on wire rack till oil has been drained.
Place the tofu in a bowl and pour the sauce gently without wetting the tofu.
Topped it with daikon radish, green onion, and dried bonito flakes.
