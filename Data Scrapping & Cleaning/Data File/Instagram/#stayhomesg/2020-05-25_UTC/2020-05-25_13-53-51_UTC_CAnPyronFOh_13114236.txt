Day 49:
.
Woohoo, my very own version of Roasted Pork Belly!
.
Words can’t explain how happy I was when I saw this end product today!
.
After yesterday’s failure, I came to a conclusion that my slab of pork belly was too small for the recipe I followed. My pork belly was burnt and an absolute disappointment. 🤦🏻‍♀️Hahaha.
.
So I turned down the cooking time and temperature based on my own estimation and got this beauty!
.
There’s still room for improvement, and I shall continue experimenting! 😎
