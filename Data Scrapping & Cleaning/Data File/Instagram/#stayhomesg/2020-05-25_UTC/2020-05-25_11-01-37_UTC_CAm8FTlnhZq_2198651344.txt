[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Everyone's trying to adjust to life during these unprecedented times, so it's always extra comforting to eat something that reminds us of how our "previous" days used to be.
.
Here's my chilled Signature Mango Jelly Smoothie (U.P. S$6.95) from @HuiLauShanSingapore at @Nex.Singapore. My all-time favourite dessert drink from Hong Kong. Something I always had on my family trips there when I was young. ‚ù§Ô∏è I like slurping the jelly up, and the mango smoothie is blended on the spot using fresh mangoes.
.
With the recent developments in HK, I just hope that one day it will revert to be the same food and shopping paradise we know it to be. üôè
