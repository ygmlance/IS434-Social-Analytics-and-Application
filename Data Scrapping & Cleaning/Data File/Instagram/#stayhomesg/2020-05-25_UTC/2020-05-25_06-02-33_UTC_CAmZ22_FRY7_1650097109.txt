It surprises me a lot how many fears we have in common with near strangers who may look or behave nothing like us. I think of these drawings of fear as clues – clues for what we really want, clues for how we may get there. I lay these drawings that participants have shared with me over each other, and they become like xray slides, the overlapping areas suddenly revealing riotious colour.
