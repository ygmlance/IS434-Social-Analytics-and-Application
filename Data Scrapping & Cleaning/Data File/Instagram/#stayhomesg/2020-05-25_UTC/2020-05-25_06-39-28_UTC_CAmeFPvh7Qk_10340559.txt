Got inspired to make this when I watched @sgagsg @nubbadtv Guide The Goondu episode of making Kueh Raya. Laughing at Annette and Pam more like coz very funny. HONEY CORNFLAKES!
Recipe:
150g Cornflakes
50g Unsalted Butter
2 Tbsp Honey
Sprinkle of sugar lol 
Melt butter in a pan, add honey and sugar and stir. Add mixture to cornflakes and bibim them up. Put into the paper cups and bake in a pre-heated oven/air fryer at 150degC for 10min. 
I agar agar the proportions coz I don’t have a weighing scale. I didn’t have oven/air fryer so I used a toaster-oven and med heat.
This recipe makes about 30-40cups, depending how much you put. I’m quite generous la. I made about 100 cups with 1 whole box of 325g cornflakes. You can adjust the honey and sugar to your sweet preference. 
My mom commented that it tasted slightly different from the usual makciks one, maybe they added condensed milk or what. 
Wew feeling accomplished and satisfied! Tasty!
