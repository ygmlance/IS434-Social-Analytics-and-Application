Kueh Lapis - 成功!

Loving all the sessions #phoebefoong and I had together in the kitchen trying out things we have never done before. Children taking on cooking is not easy especially when quite a bit of patience is required. Before the dish can appear, there is a whole lot of steps and instructions and each ingredient on its own doesn't quite look like the end product!

I am very proud of #phoebefoong for completing her fav kueh with me. It is not difficult but time consuming. I think her biggest lesson is not to whisk the paste so much because we spent quite some time sieving the foam. 😅 And her happiest moment has to be eating all the end product and handing them out to neighbours and sending to her grandparents.

For the record, these are really quite yummy and we will surely attempt again!
