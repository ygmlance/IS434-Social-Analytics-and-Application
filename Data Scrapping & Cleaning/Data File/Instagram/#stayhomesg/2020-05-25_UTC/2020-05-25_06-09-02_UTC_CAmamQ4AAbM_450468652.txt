staying home with @tonggardensg means awesome snacking time with tasty healthier choices! i’m really enjoying their unsweetened crunchy peanut butter. satisfaction guaranteed without excessive sugar!
.
anyway, @tonggardensg is having a very good deal online. check out their Nutrione Healthy Snacks Bundle which is now at $24 (u.p. $35.50). the Bundle has 8 full size items including snacks, nuts, cereal drinks & peanut butter to satiate our tastebuds. the items also come with a limited edition tote bag & water bottle, very cute!
.
this bundle is available at bit.ly/TGhealthybundle (while stocks last), with $5 islandwide delivery or free with purchase of $35 and above. get yours okay!
