I read Krishnamurti’s Freedom from the Known so many times while doing this project. A lot of it is really confrontational, because it forces you to look at things in a different way. Most of his writings are best suited for reading alone in an empty, sunny library. Where you have time and space to disagree with him, and tell the book that no, it’s wrong, and then maybe slowly come around and wonder if perhaps some parts of it are right afterall. ⁠
