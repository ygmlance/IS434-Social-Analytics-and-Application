YOU CAN LIFT OTHERS UP!😊
.
Get in a workout and positively impact someone else’s life!

At UP, we believe that both physical and mental strength have a strong correlation with one another. Better physical health helps to alleviate any feelings of depression while good mental health can have a positive impact on your physical health. These two aspects of health are particularly important in these challenging times of Covid-19.

In collaboration with the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), Ultimate Performance Singapore will be holding a charity workout fundraiser. This fundraiser will help SAMH to continue to reach out and support their beneficiaries during this tough and uncertain period.

Join us in caring for those in need, whilst caring for yourself at the same time.
