I am a sucker for Saba (Mackeral), in both raw and Shime (cured) forms so I love this Saba Bo-Sushi ($60) from @nishikane.sg immensely.
Here, the naturally strong flavours of the #mackerel fish is perfectly tempered by Chef-owner @nobuhiro.nishi.7’s vinegar cure. A sexy smokiness cloaks the big, thick roll (seriously, I think it can be shared by 2 pax) which is very delicious as it is made with top grade sushi rice and has bits off crunchy pickles buried within. The oil from the fish also adds a heavenly richness to the perfectly cooked grains.
Unwrapping the Saba Bo-Sushi is a lovely ritual in itself. You can’t help but want to linger over the beauty of the natural packaging used by Chef Nobu.
Thank you so much @uncle_lim_chiak for this treat. It’s uncanny how of all the restaurants you could have chosen, the new @nishikane.sg was your pick because I’ve actually been stalking Chef Nobu for a while now because his food looks so interesting and tempting. So being able to enjoy it was double happiness.

For now, to order takeaway from this restaurant, please WhatsApp Chef Nobu at:
