Laksa craving comes once in a while for me.

Around my area do not sell good laksa and I always felt there ain't enough ingredients.

Mom's home made laksa is probably the time I can add on more ingredients for a hearty and fancy bowl.
*though there are no hum. Sadly.

But for now, this is satisfying enough.

Is laksa your Thing?
