🌟There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle. 🌟 mmm... quite difficult to treat EVERTHING as a miracle? Haha... maybe let’s start with keeping a mind of gratitude... to having a shelter, having a good education, having access to buying what we want (online during CB), having an ok health etc. Don’t take things for granted and that includes relationships, friendships and kinships. Today, I’m also going to make full use of this extra public holiday to try and complete my work (schedulings and more schedulings), my online brush letterings classes and if I’m lucky, to squeeze in a chocolate art piece. 😍 For now, I shall focus and enjoy my special homemade French Toast with kaya, paired with Starbucks caffe latte! Oh, I used a new rose coffee stencil art today! 🌹Wishing all and myself a productive and “miracle” Monday! 🤩✨✨✨
