Feeling Garang.
.
Mask Camo Full (SGD $8.90) @ SupaSew.
.
From a small batch producer of hand made, sewn cloth masks. These artisanal masks are fashionable, vibrant, and elegant, with the option to incorporate additional disposable filters.
.
This features a dual-layer full camouflage print on cloth, with string straps that loop comfortably around the ears.
.
The hand sewn mask fits snugly over the nose and mouth, yet its pyramid shape allows for easy breathing. A bold statement piece for the urban jungle.
