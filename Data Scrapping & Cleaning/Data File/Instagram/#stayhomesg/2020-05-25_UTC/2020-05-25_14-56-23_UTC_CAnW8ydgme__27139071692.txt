This time a long weekend, and another 9 masks done (39 now) + 9 masks wonderclipped to finish this coming Saturday. Kinda happy with how my lines have gotten neater! Though I had the massive itch to get on with my Peppermint mag x In the Folds wrap top, but I went with the #practicalsewing :â€™)

Still using the @keiko_olsson tutorial! But lengthened the starting rectangle slightly to 33 x 25 cm.
