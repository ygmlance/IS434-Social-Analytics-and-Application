LOCAL UPDATEðŸ“¢We have reached over 1,000 Telegram users!

The aim of this initiative is to support the local F&B outlets especially through this period, which many of them do not have delivery capabilities. However, this is not done by us alone, but by the effort of the community, so THANK YOU Local Shoppers for your support thus far.

We hope that you would continue to hang in with us as we seek to improve on our service to bring greater value to you. We assure you that we are doing our best and we believe that together, we can help support our local F&B businesses!

If you have any feedback on how we can improve or have any questions, feel free to drop us a message :) #sglocalshops #sgunited #stayhomesg #supportlocal
