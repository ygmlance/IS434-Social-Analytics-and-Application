Whisk.\nHeat oil in a square frying pan over medium heat. Use a brush to dip more oil and apply to the pan evenly.\nPour a thin layer of egg mixture in the pan, making sure that it covers all sides of the pan. Do not pour too much as you need to repeat this step for 6 times.\nPoke any air bubbles in the egg.\nWhen it is almost cooked, roll the egg from the one side (the side that is nearer to you) to the other of the pan.\nMove the rolled egg to the side where you started to roll. Apply oil evenly to the pan using a brush.\nPour a thin layer of egg mixture in the pan again, making sure that it spreads to the bottom of the rolled egg.\nIf it doesn't, slightly lift up the rolled egg and shifted the pan downwards to spread the egg mixture.\nWhen it is almost cooked, roll the egg from the one side (the side that is nearer to you) to the other of the pan.\nRepeat the steps for another 4 times till you are done with the 6th layer.\nHeat it for a few secs more when you are done with rolling the last layer so that it is slightly brown.\nPlace it on a plate to rest before slicing it.\nPeel and grate daikon. Serve it together with the tamagoyaki.",
