Day 47 of circuit breaker, a ABC test for Leodys. I decided to test Leodys randomly on his alphabet to see if he really know his letters. Apparently he knows all his letter. Good job my boy. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #21monthsold #alphabet #atoz #atozchallenge #abc #hbl #homebasedlearning #smallest #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
