[Rojak Story] - First time having the Special Rojak from @rojakstory. It comes with interesting ingredients on top of the traditional ingredients such as quail egg, fish ball cracker, popcorn chicken, fried cod fish flakes etc. The combo may seems weird but it works for me. The prawn paste sauce is not the gao gao, pungent type, it is more subtle and balanced to complement the ingredients. .
