Hi guys! I’m bringing this account back from the dead. No, I’m not re-opening my business! I feel encouraged that so many of us are emerging from CB much better cooks than before, so I thought I’d use this account to document my home cooking and share my learnings! It’s a fun little experiment so let’s just see how it goes.

First up, suan pan zi or abacus seeds. It’s a traditional Hakka dish that I’ve only recently attempted. I’m ashamed to admit I’ve made gnocchi more times than I’ve made abacus seeds! Check out my highlights for more.

Stay safe everyone! And keep cooking!

Sharon
