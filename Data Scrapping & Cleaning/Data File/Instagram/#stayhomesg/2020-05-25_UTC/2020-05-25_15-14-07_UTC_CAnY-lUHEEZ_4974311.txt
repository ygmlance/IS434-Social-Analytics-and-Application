[23.05.20] Day 47 of #circuitbreaker:

I gotta say..the professors and coaches at @famasg are really going out of their way to keep the kids entertained during this circuit breaker. Not only are there BJJ / Muay Thai / fitness classes for the kids to have a good dose of workout, they have also came up with BINGO, painting, baking, dress-up workout parties…! 👏🏻 Happy are the parents who get some me-time while the kids are meaningfully engaged.
