Philly Cheesesteak 
Thinly sliced yakiniku beef (found this easier than trying to slice beef steaks thinly) with caramelised onions topped with Gruyere cheese. So easy, so yummy! (P.S. Most philly cheese steak recipes use Provolone cheese. But I find that too light tasting. So swopped it for Gruyere)

Thanks @smilingpollen for the inspiration.
