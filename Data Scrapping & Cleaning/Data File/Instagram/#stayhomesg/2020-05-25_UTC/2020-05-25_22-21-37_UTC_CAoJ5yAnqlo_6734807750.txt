Last evening just before bedtime, Hugo took out a backpack and gave one to Harley, he put in some books and snacks and his puppy and went into the bedroom. I suppose they are right, sleep is a kind of adventure too!! #followingjoy #followthechild #adventurrbuddies #growingupwithsiblings #montessoriwithmultiples #bedtimefun #stayhomesg #sgunited
