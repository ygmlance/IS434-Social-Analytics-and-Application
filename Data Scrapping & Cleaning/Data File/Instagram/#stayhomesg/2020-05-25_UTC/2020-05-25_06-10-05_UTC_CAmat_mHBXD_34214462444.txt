Long Weekend but can’t seem to head out anywhere in this situation 😅⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Decided to spend time making some Bawang Goreng aka Fried Shallots 🧅👩🏻‍🍳⁣⁣
⁣⁣
There seems to be a sense of satisfaction despite the effort and time taken to do it ☺️⁣⁣
⁣⁣Took a few attempts to master the technique as my first attempt ended up with burnt shallots 😂💪🏻⁣⁣
⁣⁣
It goes so well with many dishes too! 🤤⁣
Who loves it like I do? 😍❤️⁣⁣
