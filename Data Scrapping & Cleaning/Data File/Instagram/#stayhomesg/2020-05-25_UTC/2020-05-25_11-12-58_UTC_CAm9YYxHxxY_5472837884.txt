Sometimes, children are expected to be creative or paint ‘freely’ without being taught how to mix colours or how to use a brush. .
.
Our goal is for students to gain confidence in their strokes, while learning how to create a painting through simple steps. Once a students know how to draw/mix their colours, lack of skills will not hinder their development of a personal vision. So join us to paint at home every Saturday, to learn from masterpieces in simple steps! Each painting takes 2 Saturdays to complete.
.

Our online painting class will be done via Instagram Live every Saturday at 3-5pm (details will be posted on Friday nights!)

Here’s Sierra’s painting with a little help from her mummy. She is using a4 canvas panel!
Tip: paint on smaller sized canvas if you couldn’t catch up in previous classes! .

Stay safe, stay healthy and take care ♡ .
