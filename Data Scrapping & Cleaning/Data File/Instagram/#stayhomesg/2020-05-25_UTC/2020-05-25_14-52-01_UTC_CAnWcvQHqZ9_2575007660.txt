I definitely can get use to being at home when I know I can get my Stay Home dessert box from @mydaily.bread !
🔻
This ‘happy’ box consist of a hint of their best offerings and BOY!, was I delighted! Like a kid in a candy store, I get to pick from the selection of sweet treats such as the Burnt cheese cake, Chocolate Brownie, Earl Grey Tea Cake, Chocolate Chip Cookies and Macarons! IMHO, they were all enjoyable and of high standard! Special mention has to be their macaroons which with its unique flavors and excellent texture makes it one of the best that I’ve tried!

I thoroughly enjoyed this Stay home dessert box and i would recommend you guys to check out their profile @mydaily.bread for their latest bakes and Promos!
