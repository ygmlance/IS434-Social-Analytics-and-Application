It's a Mola Mola kind of day. :) I'm so happy how this turned out!! ☀️🐟

Have you had days when your mind tells you to do something but you put it off because there's something else more "important" to attend to? Been feeling like that about painting recently. Like I'm losing my drive or something. .
Today I felt an urge to paint again. Well, specifically to paint a Mola Mola. I'm not sure why but I'm glad I answered it. 💓
