Our team decided to get together for yet another good cause during the Circuit Breaker. Tiktok will donate $1 per post to the Invictus Fund and Tiktok SG will donate to the Community Chest, depending on the level of participation. The hand sign shown in the video means "care" in American Sign Language (ASL). It is our hope as a team that our small gesture can make a difference and inspire others to do so as well. Come join in the #careforsg challenge, if you haven't done so already! ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
