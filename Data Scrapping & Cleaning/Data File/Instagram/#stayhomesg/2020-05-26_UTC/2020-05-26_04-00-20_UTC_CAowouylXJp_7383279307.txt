During their colonial rule, France did more than introduce their baguettes and their fancy pâtés, they also brought to Vietnam the recipe for crêpes.⁠
⁠
Referred to as Bánh Xèo, this crêpe-like delicacy boasts a crispy outer shell made of rice flour, coconut cream and turmeric for colour. The filling comprises pork, shrimp, mung bean, bean sprouts and green onions and the dish is enjoyed with sweet chilli sauce, pickles and fresh herbs.⁠
