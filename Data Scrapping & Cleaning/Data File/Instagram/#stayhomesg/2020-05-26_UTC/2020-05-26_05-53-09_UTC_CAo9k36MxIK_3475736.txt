Since Leodys is birth, I practise a consistent mouth cleaning routine for him. When start, is just tongue swipe to clean. As he grow older, I use finger brush to brush his gum. Now that he has teeth, I use toothbrush to brush his teeth. I will even teach him how to brush his teeth in the morning and before sleep. 
After hearing so much about @dreltoothpaste Premium Toothpaste, I am delighted to finally get hold of it. Leodys loves the toothpaste and I feel very safe to let him use. It does not contain Fluoride, uses natural derived ingredients, free from 15 harmful substances. Currently he is using the baby range as he still does not know how to spit out the toothpaste. 
Now selling at $12.90, if interested please PM me. Item will send directly to your house.
