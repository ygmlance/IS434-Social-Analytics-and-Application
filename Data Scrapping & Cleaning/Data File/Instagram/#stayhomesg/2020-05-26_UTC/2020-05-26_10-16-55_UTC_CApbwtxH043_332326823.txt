“What do you mean by Mentaiko Fries upgrade?” was a common question we got today. 
Here’s a gorgeous shot by @yongweikai, showing what a burger looks like with its fries upgraded. We’ve been churning out Mentaiko Fries for the past 7 years so we daresay it’s pretty awesome-tasting 😋

Don’t miss your free upgrade available for lunch tomorrow 27th May (until 5pm). Order via #linkinbio or WhatsApp 88919298. You know you’re Mentai have it 😉
