Hey folks! We were recently hit with a supply chain disruption which depleted our OG orange pints. But this little blip won't stop us delivering scoops of happiness to you! For the time being, our lovely ice creams will be housed in new packaging - different on the outside, but still the same udderly amazing flavours inside ðŸ˜‰

Our team has made sure to source quality packaging to ensure the standard of our ice cream still remains fresh and delicious as always.

Thank you everyone for your kind understanding and support! Visit link in bio to have our ice cream delivered to you as you #StayInWithUdders!
