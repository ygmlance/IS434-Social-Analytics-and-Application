So as we could hardly go out and buy to settle our cravings, I actually took this CB as an opportunity to try new things. Like actually making one of my fav foods of all time. And also since I was frying chicken, I made some pisang goreng too. Soooooo gooooood! Took a while for the frying smell to get outta the office tho. Will likely opt to buy and not self cook next time. But hey! Now I know how. What skills have you been learning this CB? Share lei.
