You are here for a reason. You put colour into people’s lives. The world needs you. ⁣

"We have a mission - to save the world through the power of love. The world needs healing desperately, like a bird with a broken wing. People know this, and millions have prayed. God heard us. He sent help. He sent you.”⁣

Keep shining, light beams xx
