GUI Circuit Breaker Challenge: "Rejunvenating". As we're nearly through this Circuit Breaker, let's think about little uplifting moments we've been a surprised recipient of and which has raised our spirits. Gratitude is the first step to being inspired to go forth and create other rejunvenating moments for yourself and for those around you! Journal/Draw/Muse on this word today and tag us!

"Rejuvenating... big word. If you asked me about this a few months back, I would probably think about taking a holiday to a faraway land, waking up with a beautiful view and feeling like I  have all day to recharge and do whatever I want. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
But now, having been living in this Circuit Breaker, the definition of "rejuvenating" suddenly became much simpler for me. It's the simple joy of a quick walk to the grocery store, it's the happiness of waking up to a calm morning drizzle, it's that small window of opportunity to know that life goes on and then¬†come back home feeling "rejuvenated". ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
It's the feeling of being able to come back to what I truly enjoy, it's the feeling of being alive, free of any stressors and ready to welcome anything coming my way with all my heart. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
I guess this period has made me become more appreciative of¬†the rejuvenating things and activities that we have been taking for granted."
