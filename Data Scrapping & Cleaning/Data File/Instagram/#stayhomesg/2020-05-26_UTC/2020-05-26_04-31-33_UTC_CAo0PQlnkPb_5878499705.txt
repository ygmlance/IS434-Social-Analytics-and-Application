Hey everyone! I hope you had a good long weekend! Though COVID-19 sure dampens the mood for holidays but don't be dismayed, let's cheer up & have some cake!

So this cake from @thecleanaddicts ain't any normal cake! It has no eggs, dairy or refined sugars! It has nothing artificial in it & it's vegan-friendly too! Want to eat cake without feeling the guilt? Well, @thecleanaddicts is perfect for you!

This cake is definitely different from your usual cake. I was very intrigued by its texture & I'm sure a lot of thought went behind the process of making this! I loved the Hoji-Matcha cream on the cake! It packs quite a punch just like how I like it & as a Hojicha/Match lover, this combination was just perfect. ðŸ¤¤

For the cake itself, its texture & taste is slightly similar to sweet potato? It's hard to describe but it was a very interesting experience as a whole! I wouldâ€™ve liked it even more if the cake was slightly sweeter but the fact that it's sweetened using red dates is super cool too! The cake is super dense because it's made using a blend of beans & oats so one slice goes a pretty long way. ðŸ˜‰

@thecleanaddicts creates these bakes with a lot of heart & good intentions as they wish to get more people to eat clean & stay healthy! What you eat is very important for your health & prevention is always better than cure so it's never too late to start paying more attention to what you put in your body!

CB is coming to an end soon! What do you look forward to after the end of CB? I'm definitely gonna go visit my mum when CB is over! ðŸ¤© How about you?
