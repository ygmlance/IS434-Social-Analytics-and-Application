one of my favorite @cpfoodssg is their Glass Noodles with Baked Shrimps. the glass noodles is springy, peppery & comes in good portion to fill me up. there are also some vegetables, mushrooms & 2 medium sized shrimps, all packed together in a microwaveable box. my joy of having this got amplified when i’m famished yet lazy to cook. it is an instant joy in mins!
.
