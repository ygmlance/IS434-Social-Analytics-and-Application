Day 48 of circuit breaker, we went to hunt for cat in our corridor. Yesterday we saw a cat at our corridor, so bought Leodys out to see, but the cat went into the fenced garden. I kept meowing to lure the cat out, but it didnâ€™t. Today Leodys kept saying see mao mao, so I bought him out. He went to the same spot and did the same action as me to lure the cat out. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #21monthsold #catcalling #meow #luringcat #catlovers #catlover #maomao #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
