A little kindness goes a long way. In times like these, we can extend a helping hand to the less privileged and to those in need.

There are many ways you can give back this Circuit Breaker, and this list is non exhaustive. Other than monetary donations, with some free time on your hands, you could consider doing some cleaning and perhaps donate old clothing, books or other essential items that you no longer need to those who needs it. No act of kindness is ever wasted.

Make a difference today.
