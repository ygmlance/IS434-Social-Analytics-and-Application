Like the 'circuit breaker', the Polaroid Challenge, #PolaroidStayHome is extended till 1st June 2020!

Stay Home, Shoot More!

And with the whelming response, @polaroid_asia has added 2 more films for runner-ups!! The first Polaroid Challenge by @8storeytree , with the theme 'STAYHOME'. During this time of the 'circuit breaker' in Singapore, we're looking for photos/submissions that follow the theme 'STAYHOME'. Whether it may be the things you're doing at home or just love ones you're spending more time with during this period. We want your interpretation.
