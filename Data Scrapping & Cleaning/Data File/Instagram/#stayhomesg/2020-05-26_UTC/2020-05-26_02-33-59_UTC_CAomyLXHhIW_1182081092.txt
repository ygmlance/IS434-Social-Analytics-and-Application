Throughout the long weekend we are all hard at work harvesting our fruits of labour to be up on our online store !! We are looking at another month of restricted activities and we are definitely ramping up our sourcing and delivery efforts, we are supporting you in all your daily needs with regards to constant supply of fresh produces. 
Non delivery days are spend harvesting and making sure the checks are in place for all our overseas export. It has been long drawn with this pandemic but we are all going to come out stronger and brighter battling all of this with a smile :) Just like belle. 
Sometimes it takes a kid to remind us that nothing is worth pondering over and being frustrated over. 
We got you like how you have gotten us over the years. Only at www.quanfaorganic.com.sg
