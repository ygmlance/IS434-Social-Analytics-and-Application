ðŸ”¥Found ourselves in a bit of a pickleðŸ”¥

Inji Puli Milagai ~ Sweet & tangy green chilli pickle ðŸŒ¶ðŸ’¥
We were first introduced to this lip smacking pickle by our friends @choomeezus and Tanaz
It is fast becoming a must add ingredient to well umm everything we cook ðŸ˜€ So far we've punctuate our daals, bhindi fry and paneer bhurji with it and trust us when we say that it's tots bomb.com ðŸ’¯
ðŸ“¢ Can't believe we made pickle ðŸ˜Ž 
Follow the recipe from @subbuskitchen for best results
