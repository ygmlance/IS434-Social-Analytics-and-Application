[The Downside of Couple Quarantine]
Most people see working from home as a positive, that you get to spend more time with your partner, the first person you see in the morning, the last person at night and also everything in between. Considering most of us don’t live in a mansion where you get your own personal space; a darker and less talked about side of couple quarantine is how the time spent together also gives rise to the potential risk of conflict. With varying styles in handling different situations, daily small annoyance can quickly escalate to a full blown war. We all need to understand that we are all strangers in these unprecedented times. With the added pressure of work uncertainties and the inability to head out to do what we want, we are all feeling it regardless if we put it out there anot. It’s also in these times that we all need to learn to be a little bit more patient to the people around. Let the situation draw us closer rather than pull us apart. Let us all learn to be abit more giving and understanding towards each other - for as a couple, it’s never you against them, it’s always going to be you against the world. Learn to let the little things go for it’s the bigger picture of being together that’s truly worth fighting for. Stay hopeful, stay strong and when we all pull through this together, this period would be one of the stories we tell our kids for the ages.
