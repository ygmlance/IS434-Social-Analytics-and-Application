There so many ways to spread positivity during this trying times. 
Never been so grateful to be able to spend 1st Day of Raya without having to think about catching a flight to random countries during this pandemic period. 
Thank you my flying mommies for doing this #sunglasschallenge !! We sure do have lotsa of fun getting this shoot done!❤️ Precious moments like these are priceless and deserve a post on its own.
