Can’t say no when Chef friends WhatsApp to say they will be sending over lunch. More so when it is @josephyeois with his #HariRaya menu, an inspiration from his Indonesian nanny’s cooking he’s enjoyed since childhood.
Full force in #rempah, his dishes were fragrant and highly appetising. The level of spiciness varied from the milder Opor Ayam and Palembang-style Beef Rendang into which Telur Pindang (aromatics-infused hard-boiled eggs) were added, to the slightly hotter Sayur Lodeh (loved this splashed over Chef Joseph’s Ketupat, the pandan leaf-wrapped sticky rice), and the pleasurably fiery Sambal Goreng Udang. Included on the side was a container each of Sambal Belado and #Serundeng (spiced shredded coconut) to mix and match with each spoonful of food however I liked.

If you too enjoy this type of robustly-flavoured Indonesian dishes, please follow @josephyeois on Instagram as he’s planning to make this menu available for purchase soon.
