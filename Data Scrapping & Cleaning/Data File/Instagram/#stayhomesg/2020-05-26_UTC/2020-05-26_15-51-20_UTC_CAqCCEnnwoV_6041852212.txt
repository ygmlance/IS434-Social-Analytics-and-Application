Super stressed today near dinner time as i was locked out of my work laptop this evening

Luckily I had started the pressure cooker for the soup and rice cooker

After the nearly 1 hour call with the Helpdesk, quickly oven baked a fish fillet with garlic herb topped with mayo and parmesan cheese

Tamago egg from my Donki trip on Monday
