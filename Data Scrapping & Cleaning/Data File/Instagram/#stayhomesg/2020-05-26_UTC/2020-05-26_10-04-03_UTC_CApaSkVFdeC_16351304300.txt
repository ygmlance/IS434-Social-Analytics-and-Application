Hi! I am Sid, Chef-Owner of Fireless Kitchen. After many years in the kitchens of famous luxury establishments, I decided to open Fireless Kitchen. 
Fireless Kitchen focuses on creating healthy, hearty and affordable meals. These meals are prepared without the use of open flames and primarily use sous vide cooking techniques. Ingredients are vacuum sealed and cooked in a water bath at accurately regulated temperatures to deliver consistently tasty, juicy and nutritious meals.

Although Covid has impacted us significantly, we are grateful that our customers are still supporting us through these tough times!
Weâ€™ll get through this together! 
Fireless Kitchen is open for takeaways and island-wide delivery.
