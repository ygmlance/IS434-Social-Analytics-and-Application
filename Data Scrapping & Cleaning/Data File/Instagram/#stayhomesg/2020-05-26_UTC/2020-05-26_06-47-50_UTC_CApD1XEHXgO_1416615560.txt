Counting down to 6 more days to the end of CCB and the children will be back to school!
This stay-home period requires activities, lots of them to make staying home interesting! 😊

From home workouts, computer games, building LEGO boats, finding a green worm in the vegetables, growing crystals, staircase climbing to the craziest activity of celebrating the first “birthday” of Joshua’s Ice Bear... 😯

This CCB brings us time for reflection and helps many of us to realize the simplicity of happiness. 
These pictures will remind me, in time to come, how we got through this adversity together. ❤️ #covid19circuitbreaker #sgunited #maskup #stayhomesg #staysafestayhome #homeactivities #bebetterthanyesterday #treasurethemoments #creatingmemories #clarelyx #joshualyz #jacoblyh #cherylhotraveldiary #sgmummy #motherof3 #familylifeambassador #mrssingaporeuniverse2014
