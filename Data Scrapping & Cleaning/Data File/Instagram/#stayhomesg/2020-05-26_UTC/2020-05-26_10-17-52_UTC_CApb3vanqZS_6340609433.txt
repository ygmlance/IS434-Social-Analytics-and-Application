Original Bean Curd Tarts (8pcs/box), $10 from 𝐋. 𝐄. 𝐂𝐚𝐟𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐲 & 𝐏𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲. ⠀
⠀
This is the LEGENDARY beancurd tart that’s highly popular!! We finally got our hands on it, after a long wait... (Place our order online approx 2wks ago, select the pickup date/time/location and wait patiently for the day to come!) These tarts need to be refrigerated immediately and best consumed in 2 days as they are freshly baked daily! ⠀
⠀
Best to eat it out from the fridge when the beancurd is chilled. Tart crust is very sturdy, buttery, and tasteful, together with that irresistible beancurd which is very soft, silky, smooth and fragrant! Delectable and suitable for all ages, we couldn’t stop at one tart and had reach out for the 2nd tart! This is totally worth the hype and as we are typing this post, we are going to place our next order soon again for collection 2wks later as the earliest date available is from 7th June! You are highly recommended to place your orders 2 weeks in advance to avoid disappointment. Enjoy these tarts over a cup of hot coffee ☕️! ⠀
