Blessed First Birthday to our cute little niece, Jayleen! Hubby’s cousin requested a cake for her, and while I’m fine letting children below 2 have a little taste of adult cakes here and there, I’m still a little iffy about letting them indulge in tons of sugar from it. So here’s a baby cake, made using whole wheat flour, sweetened with fruit and just a tiny tiny bit of maple syrup. I also frosted the cake with overnight strained greek yogurt, so that it won’t be too runny. I hope the little one likes it!
