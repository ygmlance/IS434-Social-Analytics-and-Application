Have you seen the viral image of the ingredients that make up Nutella? Homemade “Nutella” is incredibly easy to make and it’s tastier and waaaay healthier. This recipe calls for 4 ingredients (30mins): Roasted hazelnuts, dark chocolate, pure vanilla extract, salt, sweetener (optional).
For full recipe: @minimalistbaker
I used a little less than 2 cups of roasted hazelnuts and it yielded about 200ml (6.75oz). The hazelnuts I bought from @patsoven came roasted so I saved some time.
Agave was my 5th ingredient and as the recipe says, the more liquid sweetener you use, the denser the spread will be. I used about 1 tbsp of agave and blended it longer for a smoother consistency.
