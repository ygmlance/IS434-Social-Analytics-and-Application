#whati8today It is usually difficult to prepare lunch during a work day, with both of us working & it just gets a little stressful thinking about someone pinging you on your laptop/taking too much time & running late for your meeting/having to gobble down lunch.
.
We usually order in a simple meal just to make things less complicated (of course with my #shopee hack to get 12% discounts minimum!)

SmartyPence Tip 💡
Making a 1-dish meal saves time & money! My curry chicken with steamed buns was quick & gives steaming comfort food bliss! I think piping hot food is the biggest compromise for food deliveries in addition to the higher cost versus cooking it yourself. Opt to create simple 1 dish meals once in a while to add some spice 😁 (pun intended) to your repertoire while saving some 💰

The food math:
Sing Long curry paste: $1.60 (this is a nice spicy paste w a kick!)
Potatoes: $0.50
Frozen chicken breast: $3
Coconut milk (whole packet): $0.90 
Steam buns: $2
Total: ~ $8 for 2 pax (> half the cost of ordering in) 
What are some easy 1-dish meals that you recommend?
