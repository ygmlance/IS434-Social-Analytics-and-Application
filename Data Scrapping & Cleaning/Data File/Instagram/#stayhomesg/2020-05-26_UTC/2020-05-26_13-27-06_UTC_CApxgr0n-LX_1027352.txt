A good friend is one who looks out for you and quietly does things to show support. Just like @wendydaisy who DM-ed me about her friend Viviane’s homemade goodies under the name of @asweetmesssg.
#Asweetmesssg’s menu is compact as it contains only items Viviane is confident she does well at - I like that approach a lot. The proof really is in the eating of course, and her Banana Bonanza ($30), a gorgeous loaf loaded with chunky pieces of mushy banana and walnuts was all the evidence I needed. What a fragrant, highly-textural adventure in the mouth that was. 
I also got to try her rainbow-coloured Ondeh Ondeh ($12 for 20pcs). Pretty pops of pastel colours notwithstanding, they tasted legit! Each of the soft and chewy mochi-like kueh had a tiny crunchy nugget of Gula Melaka tucked within its liquid heart. Mmmm... This is one of those sinfully good munchies you will want to keep attacking, even as your conscience frets and wrings its hands, completely ignored in the corner.
Viviane may have only started her home-baking gig last Christmas but through word-of-mouth, her business has been growing steadily. It’s easy to see why. Do slide into @asweetmesssg’s DMs if you want to order one or more of her delicious creations to try.
