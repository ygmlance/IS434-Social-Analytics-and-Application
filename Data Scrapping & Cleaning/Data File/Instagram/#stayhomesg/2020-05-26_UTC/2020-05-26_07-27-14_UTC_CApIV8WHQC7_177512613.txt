So you would have already noticed people going about with shields these days right? I for one, had seen hawkers wearing them at the food stalls and it sure beats wearing a mask the whole day at work. But hor, wear both for greater safety! ðŸ˜œ

Thanks too, to our friends from @younggenerationgifts for sending these over for the family, along with more masks! You guys seem to be doing more of a public service with this kind of pricing that comes with free delivery some more!
