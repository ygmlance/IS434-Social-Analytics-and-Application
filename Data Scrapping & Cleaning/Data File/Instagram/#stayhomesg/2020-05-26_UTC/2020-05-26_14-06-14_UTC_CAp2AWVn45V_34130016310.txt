Made a big batch of ginger scallion oil to eat with mum's chicken rice 🙌🏻! Keeps very well in the fridge (like it will stay there long? 👀🤔), and can pair with ANYTHING, super versatile 🤤! Love this so much 😍, especially when eating chicken at a particular restaurant (I keep asking for refills until the sauce plate that comes become smaller and smaller 🙄). Ownself make can eat until I nose bleed 🤣. #姜葱醤 #gingerscallionsauce #gingerscallion #sghomecook #sgeats #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgfooddiary #sgfoodbloggers #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodblog #sgfoodstagram #sgfoodgram #sgigfood #sgigfoodies #igsgfood #igsgfoodies #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #sgmakan #sgmakandiary #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #stayhomesg #sgunited
