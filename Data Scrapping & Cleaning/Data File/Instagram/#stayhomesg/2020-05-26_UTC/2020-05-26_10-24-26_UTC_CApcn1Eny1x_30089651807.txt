This quote has always hold a very special meaning to me ever since I first received my first reminder cuff a really long time ago and every-time when I feel like giving up, having this on my wrist has always kept me going. So I hope everyone who is going through a difficult time now can always be reminded that as long as you believe you could, you will succeed in whatever you do. ðŸ˜Œ
