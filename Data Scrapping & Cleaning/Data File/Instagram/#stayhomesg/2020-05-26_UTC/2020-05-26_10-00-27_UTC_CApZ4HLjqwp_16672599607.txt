Breaking Circuit 50...
SUN, moon, star...Big bear farted...and the sun set it on fire! Burning so brightly, that I want to burn with it...Not to get crispy, too much heat gives me heat hives. It just looks so inviting! And adventurous. New Jules Verne novel? Part of the 'Voyages Extraordinaires'; 'Big bear halo's Sun'. Spin-off of 'Off on a comet'. Inspired by the great Chicago fire & cow. Guess I would find out if the fumes of big bear also contain 1% of sulfur as well!
