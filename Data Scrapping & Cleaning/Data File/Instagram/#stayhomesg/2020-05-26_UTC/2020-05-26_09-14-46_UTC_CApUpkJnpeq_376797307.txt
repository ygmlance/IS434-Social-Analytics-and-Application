Had placed my dinner order with @carraracafesg yesterday and food was delivered hot and fresh under an hour👍.
We had TomYam Seafood pasta, kecap manis chicken chop and their award winning Gelato 🦋Bluepea Lemongrass Pandan Leave🍨Tomyam pasta was creamy and nice, spiciness acceptable. Kechap manis was good cos we simply love kecap🤭 Gelato was so silky smooth and we were delighted with the aroma of the lemongrass and pandan leave, they pair up so well, so refreshing😋 Usually the lemongrass is more well-liked by adults, but surprisingly the kids said the gelato was good and had requested for additional servings🍨👏
