When someone said "careful of the snakes" 😐 *pauses... yelps, runs*

No snakes were harmed in the making of this joke cause there were no darn snakes. Nor have I had a bad encounter with one. Food for thought, maybe fear is mostly due to the unknown. The uncertain outcomes. The illusion of 'what if's. Sometimes that fear can protect you but other times what if it stops you from living to your best.

Fine, but in this particular instance I don't really care for parseltongue #gryffindork #tuesdaythoughts
