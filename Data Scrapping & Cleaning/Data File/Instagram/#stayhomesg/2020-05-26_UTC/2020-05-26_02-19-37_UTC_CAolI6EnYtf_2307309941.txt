It has been 49 days since we last picked our cameras up to capture the joyous moments of a little baby boss smashing a cake and having a fun time. His parents beaming with joy and gratefulness that we could do the photoshoot for them just before the circuit breaker kicked in.

We're unsure how many more days to go, but are certainly looking forward to the day we can start making precious memories again for beautiful people that trust us to.

As photographers in a niche genre, we are not considered to be providing an essential service (to start operating soon), but I'm sure we are deem "essential" in the hearts of many parents out there who wish to have their important family milestones documented professionally.

We'll be back soon and can't wait!

Really thankful that Bows and Ribbons Photography came up with this wonderful initiative to unite Singapore's newborn photographers who are riding through this tough time together. Gambatte! ðŸ™ŒðŸ’—ðŸ’™ðŸ’›ðŸ§¡
