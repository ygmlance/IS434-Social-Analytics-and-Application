During the circuit breaker period, our team has been leveraging on online platforms to keep our children socially connected, from the comfort of their own home. 
Play is essential to the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and youth. It is not surprising that one of the more popular online activities is the games session facilitated by our staff, which is already into its third run. Our children and youth connect, learn and challenge themselves in a fun way by playing online games like scavenger hunt, charade, quiz and more, while staying physically apart.
