[Recipe] On the dinner menu was 宮保雞丁 since there was @cpfoodssg kitchen joy series ready-to-eat charcoal grilled piri piri chicken 🌶 and sliced lotus roots in the freezer. Skipped the marinade step as the frozen chicken are already seasoned and grilled (p.s. in fact they are very yummy on their own, tender and not dry! 😋). Added on another simple stir fry rapeseed flowers 菜の花 with garlic and dried shrimps for a complete hearty meal.
