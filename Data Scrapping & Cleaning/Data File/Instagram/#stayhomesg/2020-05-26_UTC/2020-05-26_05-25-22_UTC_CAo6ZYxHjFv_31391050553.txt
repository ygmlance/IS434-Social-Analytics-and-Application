🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿Scottish ShortBread

Decided to try baking some! Never really baked cookies/biscuits before so this is probably my 2nd time? 😚 not bad at all, was a bit burnt though HAHA.

This took us back to our Europe/UK 🇬🇧 trip where we bought & ate a lot of shortbreads heh, really miss those days and places 😢 pretty sure everyone is feeling the same way.

Hang in there everyone 🥳, one day we will all be able to travel again so in the meantime let’s do our part and stay safe, stay healthy and.. stay home as much as you can! 😬🏘
