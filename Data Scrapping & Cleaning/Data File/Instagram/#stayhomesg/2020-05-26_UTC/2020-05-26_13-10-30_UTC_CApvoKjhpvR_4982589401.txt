7.35pm, rushed to the post office to mail out mask hoping it will reach children before school re-opens. Reached 10mins before closing. Im super grateful. 
A neighbour praised me but not knowing those who support by purchasing masks from me allow me to buy more supplies to make free masks for the toddlers and children in our estate eps those living in the 1 & 2 room units. Im super grateful 
My customer's support also indirectly paid for the registered postage out. Im super grateful.
Manage to buy 10 smartpacs so i can mail out daily to the p.o box nearby my estate. Im super grateful. 
A big thank you to all who supported and make this project to give back to the community happen. Im super grateful.
