Staying home is the best time for me to raid my pantry and get creative with @loacker_singapore Minis.
. 
1. Creating new cupcake flavours with Loacker Minis. As my girl is full of imagination and creativity
2. We always have little tea break with the kids during or after their HBL.
3. Having my me-time with coffee and Loacker Minis which turn out to be the best combination ever! 
4. Recently making dalgona coffee, which was the perfect chill out companion with its combination of hazelnut flavor with the coffee, you definitely need to try it! . 
You will never go wrong with a pack of Loacker Minis in your pantry. So many ways to enjoy these delicious wafers. Which is your favourite way? Do share with me by simply commenting below. ðŸ˜Š
