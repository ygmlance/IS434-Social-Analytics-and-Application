How do I look, for a trip to the supermarket? 💃🏻I’m wearing my new bralette from @ourbralette.club pretending that I’m on a date 🤣.
.
Besides looking like luxurious lingerie, the bralettes I got from @ourbralette.club are comfy as they don’t have underwires and the lace is oooh so soft! They have nursing bralettes too, for breastfeeding mums...I wished they were around during my “new mummy” days 🤱because when you wear beautiful and functional lingerie, it lifts your mood up, especially when you feel you look like crap after having a baby ❤️.
.
Do swipe to see the other 2 pretty bralettes I’ve got! The white one has a v-style ribbon that sits on top on your bust, giving the illusion of a fuller bust, while the blue one has a band that gives good support without the discomfort of underwires.
.
Ladies you got to hit their IG to see their collection! Guys, you can pick something for your gf / wife 🎁. The pricing is affordable too, check out their starter kit which is $40.80 for 2 bralettes 😍.
