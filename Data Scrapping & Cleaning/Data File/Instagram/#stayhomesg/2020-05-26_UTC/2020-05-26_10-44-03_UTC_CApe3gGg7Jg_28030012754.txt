❗️ Why is the mask black in color ?

Graphene is chosen as the material of the mask instead of silk mask.
Graphene is a thin layer of pure carbon. Stronger absorption capacity. It easily absorbs dirt and makeup residues on our skin. It has anti-bacteria effect and can further prevent acne breakout. It is Environmentally friendly, soft and breathable, and works best with essence.
