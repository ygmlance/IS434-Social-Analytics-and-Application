One of my top parenting worries has always been the boysâ€™ Chinese language learning journey as me and the hubs both come from predominantly English speaking families.
.
We do try to put in effort where possible, by revising the materials from school and since we have time on hand this Circuit Breaker, I decided to order some Chinese learning resources for both of them from @playlexue to try and these have come in really handy as they offer a wide range of materials for varying ages.
.
They have sound books (which I find more engaging for CEOâ€™s age), story books, busy bags, Chinese character writing materials (this was useful to train Matty to start writing smaller characters) and many more.
.
Swipe left to see how the mathematics Q&A sound book for Matty works, it teaches / quizzes him maths concepts in mandarin and heâ€™s able to independently respond. My personal fave was the nursery rhymes sound book that plays a different short song every time you press a button, because so cute to see my potato/ â€˜gan tangâ€™ son trying his best to sing to his baby brother. The mini audience gave â€˜faceâ€™ to Matty too by sitting through the entire song because sitting still for more than 5 secs these days is an impossibility!

If you are also looking for chinese materials to share with your kids, do check out the @playlexue website. For starters they have free activity sheet printables, these should buy you at least 15 minutes of parenting peace ðŸ˜‰
