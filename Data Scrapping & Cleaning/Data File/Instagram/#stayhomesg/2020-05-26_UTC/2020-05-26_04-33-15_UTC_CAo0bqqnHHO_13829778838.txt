Green Bag Obsession: Part 3 ðŸ’šâ €
â €
This is the bag i hunt for yearss. Having no connection, it's like almost impossible for me  to get it. I put my name in the waiting list on many outlets, none I receive a call once. Not as mighty as the signature Birkin bag, this is Hermes Herbag Zip. â €
â €
Got it in my Starclub incentive trip in Moscow. Went in shop to try my luck, and so so glad the sales associate told me they have it. He said "BUT it is in green", thinking I may not want it. The truth is I LOVEEE IT!!! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©â €
â €
Seriously, I lost myself at the moment. Immediately said I want it without trying and checking etc. He asked if I want to add on a scarf. YES YES, of course I want!! Pink and green combination I chosen. â €
â €
Some things are so hard to come by. So so glad I managed to get it. And of course all the memories that accompanied with the bag. Loving it all. â €
