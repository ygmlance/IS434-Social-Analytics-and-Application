Day 50 of Circuit breaker dinner.
This is a very refreshing porridge for a very hot day.
Cooked in a thermal cooker.
One hour and it was done.
My usual organic brown rice & organic barley.
Supposed to be orange sweet potatoes. I checked with the seller she say yes. But end up yellow.
行情不好，就乱乱骗人，目的是要清她的货。😑
Forget to add in the century egg. 😁
Nevermind 。这样配。也可以。
Just eat as a side dish.
Today steamed a Lup Cheong tomatoes egg.
This time no ugly face. I learn my lesson. Dared not to directly pour on the egg.
This meal is done in an hours time.
Including cutting and slicing , wash rice,  this rice no need to soak and even folding of my D.I.Y disposable aluminium steaming plate.
小姐们 Ladies, cooking can be easy and simple. Get a thermal cooker and let it do the work. I hates washing, so i come out with this method,  since my century egg is the last one, i used the plastic box to served. Throw away later. 
Work with lesser ingredients,  the more you prepare the more time consuming.
By now you should have noticed why i keep repeating my ingredients.
Save time &  healthy. 😊
