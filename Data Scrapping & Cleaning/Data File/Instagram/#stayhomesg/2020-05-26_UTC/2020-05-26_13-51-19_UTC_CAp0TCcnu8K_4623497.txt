My kids decided to accelerate themselves into Primary 6 math 🤓🤣

We discovered @koobits📚 opens up EVERY grade, not just the kid’s current grade. So they can learn and try their hand at questions in grades below or above them!

And the boys - out of sheer curiosity - decided to try it out.

Hunter tackled P6 Algebra, while Carter took a shot at P6 Fractions.

The syllabus starts off simple then ramps up, so it gives kids a chance to learn and build skills, even if its more advanced.

I’ll be honest - they were also delighted that other grade levels still awards them KokoCredits which they could then redeem for books and games 😉 Win win!
