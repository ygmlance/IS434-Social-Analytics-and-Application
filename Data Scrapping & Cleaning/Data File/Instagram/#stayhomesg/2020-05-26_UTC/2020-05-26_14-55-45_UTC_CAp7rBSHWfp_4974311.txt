[24.05.20] Day 48 of #circuitbreaker:

The big-hearted instructors imparted more Nagomi Art tips and knowledge with fund-raising workshops over the weekend. Took me quite some time to come up with these because some of the techniques were quite challenging IMO. (Thankfully the husb would help with the chores and parenting duty when I bury myself in soft pastels!) If you’re keen to learn more / explore Nagomi Art and do charity while at it, do check out @artpeacesg on Facebook for more details on the various charity drives they are organising! There are still a couple of Nagomi Art workshops to go before the circuit breaker ends.
