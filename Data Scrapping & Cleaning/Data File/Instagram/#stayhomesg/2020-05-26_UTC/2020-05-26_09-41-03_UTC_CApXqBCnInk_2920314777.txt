Feeling happy as I finally make this happen - Make A Pumpkin Cake. Added lots of pumpkin and dried mushroom plus some yam.  Sometimes, it creates quite a lot of happiness just by appreciating little things in life. I can still cook which means a lot - makes up by so many conditions, the availability of ingredients, money to buy the ingredients, a kitchen, gas, water, time, still safe and sound to do it and many other resources and conditions etc .... #sgvegetarian #sgvegan #vegetarian #meatless #sgfoodies #stayhomewithascott #sgeats #sgfoodtrend #whati8today #foodphotography #素食 #kueh #stayhomesg #sghomecooking #homecooked #homecooking
