Prawn-lovers, you will feel like you died and gone to heaven when you sip the broth by @oneprawnnoodle. It is probably the most intense in prawny-ness (had to invent a word to do this justice) I have ever come across, and what‚Äôs more, it feels shockingly silky in the mouth and not at all greasy.
Owned and run by ex-colleagues (Chef Gwyneth and Chef Kun use to work together at @burntends_sg), #OnePrawnNoodle sells prawn noodles with different toppings. Prices start at $5 for a ‚ÄúSliced Pork and Prawn‚Äù and goes up to $8 for the ‚ÄúAbalone and Prawn‚Äù. What I find interesting is the menu of add-ons they offer which lists the parts of a pig: lean meat, skin, intestines, tail and ribs, as well as novel items such as beancurd skin rolls (it is the same kind as you get at #BeautyInAPot and is brilliant dunked in the broth), prawn balls, abalone, vegetables and a whole egg. Despite this, there‚Äôs no denying it is their hypnotically rich broth that is the be-all and end-all. So the commonsensical thing to do is to order the soup version, right? However, what if I told you that the dry-style is the one I think you should get? You see, this pair of young hawkers make their own sambal chilli too and it is astonishingly tasty. When noodles are tossed in that savoury spiciness, the strands become aromatic and mouthwateringly shiok. To pair, you get a big packet of the magical prawn broth. See? Their dry version really lets you enjoy the best of both worlds üòÑ.
The stall is open 7 days a week (yes, Gwyneth and Kun are extremely industrious), so do support them and give their food a try. To order, please WhatsApp:
