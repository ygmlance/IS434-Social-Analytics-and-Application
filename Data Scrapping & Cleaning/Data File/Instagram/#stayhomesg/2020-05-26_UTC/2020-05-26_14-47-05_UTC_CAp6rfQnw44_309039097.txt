Its Tuesday!
I've got fillings for you! 🥟

Loving @redstarsg dim sum as always and happen to know that it's open for takeaway during this period! Another 老字号 for their traditional pushcart dim sum... Need not say, we ordered all our fav! Missing out egg tart, char siew sou, durian roll and a few more, but is okay! At least part of dim sum craving is fixed 😄
