7am this morning with Mum and Dad, emerging from the long weekend and starting our day off with Nyonya Chang, Hokkien Bak Chang and a steaming hot pot of tea. Discussing meal plans for the week (we are on a kitchen rotation schedule ðŸ¤£) and bullying Dad into making us a jar of XO Sauce to enliven our condiment shelf in the fridge. Some condiments are just necessary for a happy belly!
