Good food is also about good combinations. Jamuna Paati recommends Mor Kozhumbu (a yogurt based dish with no lentils) to be eaten along with a Paruppu Usili ( a vegetable preparation with lentils). The lack of lentils in the kozhumbu compliments well with this type of vegetable preparation which has lentils in it.
