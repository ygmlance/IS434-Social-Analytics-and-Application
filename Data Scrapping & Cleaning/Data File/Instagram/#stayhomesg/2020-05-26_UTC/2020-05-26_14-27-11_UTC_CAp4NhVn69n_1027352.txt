There is no way you won’t gawk and then lean in to get a closer look at @petalsbyvictoria.h’s artisanal jelly cakes. They bloom with such life-like flowers of the most delicate and intricate kind, created via an injection method, so they’re completely edible as well. Victoria uses a fish gelatin for the jelly which forms the top half of the cake. Mine was peach-flavoured and it complemented the creamy cheesecake below it nicely.
As pleasant tasting it was, this is a cake to purchase when your top priority is to make an unforgettable impression in a visually impactful way. So guys, this could be an interesting alternative “bouquet” to present to your other halves for a special occasion.

Thank you @wolfgang_amadeus_ for this exquisitely beautiful surprise. Everyone gasped audibly when I opened the box to reveal its contents.
