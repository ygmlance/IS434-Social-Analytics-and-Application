My husband and I have really missed iberico de bellota steaks since coming back from our honeymoon in Spain 3 years ago. Life hasnâ€™t been the same since, but thanks to @singaporehomecooks I managed to procure two yummy steaks and cook them to medium doneness, which is PERFECT! The marbling of the pork is AMAZING, and the flavour itself is enough to wow. Served with sides of wilted kale and pan roasted yukon gold potatoes, using the fat from the pork, and a little bit of butter. SO. GOOD. .
