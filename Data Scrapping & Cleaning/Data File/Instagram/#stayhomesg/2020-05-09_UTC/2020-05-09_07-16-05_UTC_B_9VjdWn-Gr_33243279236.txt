Went to run some errands with only eyebrows and eyeliner drawn + a little concealer on my under eye. Who needs foundation when wearing a mask, right?

I have been using Eaoron’s products religiously for the past few months before I decided to launch it on Luxe Chic. I saw how it benefited my tired and dry skin with a natural glow on my face along with a list of other benefits.

My weekly regime:
Eaoron’s Hyaluronic Acid Collagen Mask 2-3 times a week
Eaoron’s Ageless Stem Cell Mask once a week
Eaoron’s Instant Whitening Mask once a week
