⁣Garlic steamed prawns with @heyrozz - one of the first dishes I really enjoyed eating when I was a kid. ⠀
⠀
The garlic paste consists of: minced garlic, minced spring onion(optional, the root part), minced red chilli, shaoxing wine, soy sauce, white pepper, salt, and sesame oil, you can add a pinch of sugar if you'd like. Then simply stuff into prawns and steam for about 8-10 mins ⠀
⠀
The bulk of the work is actually just peeling and mincing the garlic. And you're gonna need a lot more garlic than you think, leftovers can be simply folded into softened butter for a quick garlic butter spread 😌
