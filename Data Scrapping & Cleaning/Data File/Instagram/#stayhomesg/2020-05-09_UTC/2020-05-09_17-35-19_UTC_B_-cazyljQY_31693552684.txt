Supper using up the burger buns from Gardenia and double beef patties, topped with melted cheese and a bed of lettuce. Plus made the last cup of earl grey brown sugar boba tea from our DIY kit.😅

Think when #circuitbreaker ends, might just end up with a weight surplus with @yeowyy.

Today's assembled burgers reminds me of Ramly burgers. Had a hazy memory of last having Ramly burgers at a beach pasar malam with LG's bff, but I can't rmb why were we at Sentosa. (My memory has indeed failed me, it was at Jurong Lake Gardens during MAF 2019) .
