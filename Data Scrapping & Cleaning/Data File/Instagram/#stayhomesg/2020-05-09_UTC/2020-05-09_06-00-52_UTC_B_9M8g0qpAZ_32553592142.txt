Lean legs workout 💃⠀
This will work your legs in ways you wouldn’t think your legs can 😆 seriously, let’s sculpt those legs together 💪🏽⠀
⠀
BEGINNERS: do not add any weight, make sure you master this with your body weight first 🥰⠀
⠀
ADVANCED: you can add some weight as long as your technique is ok and you maintain a good form 💪🏽⠀

There’s one thing I want to say, I know some days at the moment it’s hard to find motivation to work out BUT I think this comes from having the wrong mindset... you NEED to see working out/exercising as a PRIVILEGE rather than a chore 🙏🏽 don’t think of working out as something that’s painful, like a punishment 🥺 but think of it as something you do FOR YOURSELF, that makes you feel good and gives you positive energy 🥰 which means that you have to find something that works for you 😘 I think it’s very important to highlight this ❤️ ⠀
