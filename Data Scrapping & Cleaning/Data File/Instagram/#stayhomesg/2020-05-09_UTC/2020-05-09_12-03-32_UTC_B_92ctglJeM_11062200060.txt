Plain sandwich rolls and cornets. These go well with anything, from soup, stews to sausages, otah...My bread flour finally arrived after a long wait. They’re out of stock everywhere!! It’s not my usual brand (it’s not as finely milled) so I made sure it’s sufficiently kneaded to ensure they’re still soft and fluffy.
