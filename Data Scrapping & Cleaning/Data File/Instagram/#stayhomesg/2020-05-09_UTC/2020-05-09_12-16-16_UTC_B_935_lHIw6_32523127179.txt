Fruit Tart 🥭🍋🥧
.
🍴Overall ease: 5/10
.
🛒Ingredients: doubled @tartebycherylkoh recipe for an 8 inch tart: butter, sugar, almond flour, cake flour, egg, milk, cream, vanilla, cornflour
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: 
Tart shell - 
1. Use a paddle/ wooden spoon to mix room temperature butter, icing sugar & egg
2. Fold in almond flour & cake flour.
3. Flatten, cling wrap & fridge for at least 6 hours before blind baking it at 180deg for ~30min

Cream - 
1. Combine everything over low fire but be careful to keep whisking and lowering the heat to prevent curdling (although quick pulses with a blender helped to save it by getting it back to a smooth texture)
2. Fold in heavy cream
.
😋Taste: 8/10. Although it can’t beat the original (we had it at the same time, and there’s a je ne sais quoi to her tart!), we still enjoyed our (inferior) interpretation. We reduced the sugar, and it was just the right level for us, given the natural sweetness of the fruits. But practice makes perfect and it’ll be fun to keep trying to improve this 😉
