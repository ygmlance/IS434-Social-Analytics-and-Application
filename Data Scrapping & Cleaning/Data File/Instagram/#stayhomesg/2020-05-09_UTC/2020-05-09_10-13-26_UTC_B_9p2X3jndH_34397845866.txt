Anyone else love baby porridge? 
Made huai shan, broccolini, cod fish and minced meat porridge in silver fish broth. 
Just put all the ingredients in the PPC and set the congee mode. Porridge came out silky in 13 minutes. 
Huai shan has lots of health benefits for the baby - it's great for the lungs and spleen.
