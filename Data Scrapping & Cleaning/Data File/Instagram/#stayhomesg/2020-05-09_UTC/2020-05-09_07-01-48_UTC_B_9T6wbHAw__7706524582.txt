One of my favourite food - Wanton Mee! Saw a lot of postings on home cooked wanton mee and char siew, so i decided to try to make char siew too! I do not have an oven at home so i use the happy call pan (which is really useful). I did not go to the market so decided to use what i can find at home for some ingredients: 
1. CP wantons instead of making the wantons
2. Maggie Mee instead wanton mee (egg noodles)
I think the colour of the char siew is nicely char however it is slightly on the salty side. Maggie Mee can also be a good substitute for Egg Noodles (this is what i think ü§£ü§£) #wantonmeesg #homecookedlunch
