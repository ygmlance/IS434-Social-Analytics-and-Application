Iâ€™ve decided to fill this IG account with happy memories of everyday lives (yes, quite right. During Singaporeâ€™s circuit breaker. So be prepared to be swarmed with photos and videos of house chores and being a sloth ðŸ˜„) Because life is short and Iâ€™ve learned to appreciate moments ðŸ’“. So, embrace life, my friends around the globe! Many do not have the chance to breathe, and YOU DO. 
So let life take your breath away, one happiness at a time ;) Hereâ€™s a picture of my monkey daughter with her giant bear, in her little playroom Iâ€™ve set up for her. Comes complete with princess tent and a mini sofa.

Grow up well, #krispybella ! You are blessed with many people who love you so much ðŸ’“ðŸ˜˜ For pictures of nature, follow my other account: @3lmemories
