Seems like I finally found a way to stop her from attacking me when I’m working out 🤣🤣⠀
All you need for this is a sliding surface and some socks, doggy is optional of course 😂⠀
This is pretty hard, especially exercise number 4 🥵🥵🤯😅⠀
Try 10 reps of each (each leg for exercises 1 and 2), and try 3 to 5 rounds ☺️⠀
