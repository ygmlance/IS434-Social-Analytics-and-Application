*3 LOW-PREP NUMBER PLAYS*
.
“Mama I want to play number game please.” This is a daily request from my little boy who is totally into numbers. Luckily he inspires me with loads of💡 via. our conversations and by observing the child-led number plays that he engages during free play.

Documenting and sharing 3 other low-prep math play setups that my boy loves this week, requiring only a few materials, doodles and 5minutes.

1️⃣ Apple Tree Count:
This is a “Chicka Chicka 1,2,3” book-inspired play. Jasper loved the catchy rhyme of this book. Combining this with his latest keen interest on learning numbers in word form, I drew this 🍎 tree, provided red dot stickers with numerals (as 🍎representations) and drew red dots hint to the number words. 👦🏻 was so excited and went into an imaginative play mode telling me he is now a “little farmer 👨‍🌾 planting apples”.

✅ Counting
✅ One-to-one correspondence
✅ Fine-motor skills via. peeling & pasting stickers

2️⃣ Create a Smiley🌷 Garden:
This a simplified paper and smiley sticker version of our previous “Jasper’s Garden Number Play” which we used rose petals from dried 💐 bouquets to recreate an art and math fun (perfect for after Mother’s Day 💐 fun - see story for link). This round instead of writing numerals on the 🌹, we are reinforcing mandarin numerals. Jasper loved how colourful the piece turned out while I’m totally in love with that smiling satisfied face of my little darling when he happily presents his master piece!

3️⃣ Path to Home 🏠:
Being🤰in third trimester and hub away fighting 🦠 in the front-line, we shifted to Por Por’s house at the start of the circuit breaker but my 👦🏻 is starting to miss his 22 home. So I drew this board-game path back 🏠, a 🎲 (made using playdough) and two counters (used animal figurines) for us to play counting. It was great bonding fun and it’s Jasper’s first “board game”. He was on a roll with 6 and moved far ahead of mama but said he wants to slow down to wait for mama to go home together. Aww! ✅ Number Order in 3 forms
✅ Counting
✅ Addition
