Circuit breaker day 33. Everyday super hot and super hot run. Ran into @iart_chapter while running and we made sure we were 1m apart! Baked a choc chip cake for Ryan and strawberry cake but the strawberries look gross after baking. Finished our run with hokkien Mee and char kway teow from old airport Hawker tsk!
