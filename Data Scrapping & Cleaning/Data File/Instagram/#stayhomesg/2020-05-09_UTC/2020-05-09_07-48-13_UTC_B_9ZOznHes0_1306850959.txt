💃🏻The one that lives in hope dances without music. 💃🏻 Hehe, let’s all dance in our own ways, with or without music! Sometimes, even just swirling yourself in circles is fun but watch out for your surroundings! 🤣 Today is mini dim sum day with meat bun(大包) and Siew Mai from Nanji (南记), accompanied by cute colourful cheddar goldfish baked crackers from Pepperidge Farm! This snack is introduced to me by my niece and great for families and kids! Can be found in Cold storage or NTUC. Also, pairing with peach tea. Could you tell that I was trying to plate it like an underwater theme? 😬😬😬 Again, looking forward to an accomplished weekend! Intending to try a new cake recipe again and also release new episodes of my 2017 Japan study trip on my Facebook page @JR Vacation - Japan Travel. Still trying to figure out the best way to launch it on ig.... 🧐🤔 Stay tune! 🤩 Oh yes! Most importantly, 郭福城Aaron Kwok’s concert at 5pm! He’s my childhood idol!!! 😍😍😍 #对你爱不完 #伤心的话留到明天再说
