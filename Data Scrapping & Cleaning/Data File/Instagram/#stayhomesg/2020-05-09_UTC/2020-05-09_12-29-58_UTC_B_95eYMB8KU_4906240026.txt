Since our team was formed nearly two decades ago, we have been travelling over 15000km every year to Michigan to compete with teams from all over the world. Today would have marked the completion of another year of competition for us if not for the Covid-19 pandemic across the world.

Although disappointed by this, we wish all our friends and family especially in the fsae community the best of health in this trying period and together we will come back even stronger once this is over. 💪🏻 #stayhomesg
