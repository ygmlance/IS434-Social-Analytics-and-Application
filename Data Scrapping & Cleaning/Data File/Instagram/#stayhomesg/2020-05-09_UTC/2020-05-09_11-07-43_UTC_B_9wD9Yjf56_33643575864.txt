Thank you to all our speakers, all those who watched, and everyone who shared our event today to your community! .
The topic of gratitude came up multiple times as a way to build resilience through this current pandemic crisis and as a mental health practice in general, and we'll definitely be adding all of you on the top of our gratitude list.
.
We will be planning more virtual events in the future, so stay tuned!
