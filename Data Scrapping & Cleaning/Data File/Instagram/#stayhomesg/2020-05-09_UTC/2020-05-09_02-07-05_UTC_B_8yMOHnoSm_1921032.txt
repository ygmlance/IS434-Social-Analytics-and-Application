🍁changes her name.
🍁changes her home.
🍁leaves her family.
🍁moves in with you.
🍁builds a home with you.
🍁gets pregnant for you.
🍁pregnancy changes her body.
🍁she gets fat.
🍁almost gives up in the labour room due to the unbearable pain of child birth..
🍁even the kids she delivers bear your name.

All the above because I loved this guy for more than a decade. Mother’s Day is just gonna be another usual day for me. How about you? What’s your plan tomorrow during this #circuitbreakersg?

Happy M-day in advance to all mothers in the world 🌎!
