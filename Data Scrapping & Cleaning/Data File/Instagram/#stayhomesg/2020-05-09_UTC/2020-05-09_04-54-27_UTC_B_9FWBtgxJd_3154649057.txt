If you are an essential worker - anywhere in the world - & would like a free virtual Mentalist show for yourself and/or your colleagues please get in touch and we’ll make it happen whenever suits you. 
I’ve forgotten far more shows than I remember in 17 years performing - but I’ll always remember every one of these. 
Thank you @thenewpaper for helping get the word out.
