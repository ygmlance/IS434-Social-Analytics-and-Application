@epicureasia calls our Ngo Hiang one of the best they've had: "The moist filling of the meat parcels boast extra chunky water chestnuts and onions as well as plenty generous portions of minced crabmeat and prawns. Then there is the skin that’s so crispy it shatters when you take a bite—the result of a double deep-frying process." Ngoh Hiang is available from both Violet Oon Satay Bar & Grill and our Bukit Timah outlet. ⁣
