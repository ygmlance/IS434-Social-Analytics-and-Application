Anson did a cake for me. Not a perfect cake but I love it. Fun activity to do at home during this #circuitbreaker ⁣

This is the first time Anson tried to decorate a cake. He decorated the mini cake that my sister-in-law baked. The cake is yummy. Swipe to see the bigger and nicer cake that she made. ⁣

We ordered our lunch from @jjthaicuisinesg Very delicious. I love their Tom yum soup. ⁣
