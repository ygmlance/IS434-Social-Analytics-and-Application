Pork Cutlet Egg Fried Rice with Tobiko, $7.50 from 𝐊𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞.⠀
⠀
Recently we have come across alot posts on one of the best egg fried rice in town and we decided to try too! ⠀
⠀
We arrived shortly after they open and waited 30 mins for our takeaway, it’s all worth it! Our order comes with a mega huge piece of Pork Cutlet, well marinated, super tender, juicy and flavourful, it’s sooo tasty! Egg fried egg is fried to perfection and fragrant, not too oily! This is so similar to DTF signature egg fried rice, but at a much cheaper price! We enjoyed it so much and it’s so fragrant! The extra tobiko which we topped up for adds more flavour to the fried rice!  It’s totally worth it!⠀
