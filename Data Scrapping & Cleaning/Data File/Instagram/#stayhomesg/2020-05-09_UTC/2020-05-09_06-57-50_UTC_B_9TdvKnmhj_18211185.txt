09 May 20 :: Day 33 of CB #circuitbreakersg. #sgunited #stayhomesg and #je55bakes #EnglishScones for afternoon tea. ☕️ #impromptubake

These sweet scones were baked up light and fluffy, using the ingredients i have in my pantry. They’re pretty straightforward to make. I did a few plain ones and the rest with a handful of raisins. #childrenrefusedtofinishup 🤷🏻‍♀️

Ingredients ::
350g self-raising flour, sifted
1 tsp baking powder
85g salted butter, cut into small cubes
4 tbsp sugar

Wet ingredients ::
1 tsp vanilla Essence
150g plain yogurt
4 tbsp milk

1 egg + 1 tbsp milk for egg wash, mixed together

Method ::
Put the wet ingredients in a bowl and set aside.

Pulse the flour, baking powder and cubed butter together in a blender until sandy texture. ** to try to keep everything as cool as possible, I put everything that I could (bowl, rolling pin, spoon, fork, blade of the blender) in the refrigerator so that the butter will not melt so fast.** Transfer to a mixing bowl, add in sugar and mix well.

Pour wet ingredients into the mixing bowl with flour mixture. Use a spatula and mix into a soft dough. ** I scooped up 1/3 of the mixture to make plain scones and the rest, I added raisins. ** Lightly dust working top and hands with flour. Transfer dough onto working top.

Fold the dough a 4-5 times until smooth. ** Do not over handle the dough. ** Roll the dough to 3cm thick and cut using a round cutter.

Arranged on baking tray and brush top with egg wash.

Bake at 220 degrees celcius preheated oven for 10-15mins or until golden brown.

Serve warm with jam, butter, cream cheese or even eat it plain. With a cuppa tea, of course. 😉 #butiwantclottedcream
