Circuit Breaker but the party shall go on. Rena turns 1 and Ria turns 4. Their first birthday together. And we are keeping the spirit high for them who are stuck at home. No fanciful cake but Made 2 cakes with lots of love. Chocolate vanilla and fruit jelly cake. Live party with family and friends on zoom and Facebook. @wilsonctwong
