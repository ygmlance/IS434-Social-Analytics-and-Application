Allhamdullilah.. Maiden attempt at Taiwanese Castella Cake.. Menjadi🤩🤩 Cuma ada crack kat atas. Probably cos i adjusted d original recipe , halving it. And also cos d water bath too shallow.. Shall remake a full recipe.. Once i can get my hand on a deeper tray.. 😍😍 This is an almost 100% Organic cake.. Using Organic flour and organic cocoa powder... Butter, eggs and sugar not organic...😅😅 Littlest one enjoying cake right after woken frm nap..😋😋 Little pleasures..trying to get d baking momentum back...😊😊 P.s: Credits recipe to @emojoiecuisine . I simply halved d recipe and added cocoa powder.😊😊 #keluargaminyak #mrsminyakbakes #rushplaydoh #rushplaydohbyde #taiwanesecastellacake #maidenattempt #bakeforlovewithlove #stayhome #stayhomesg #jiggly #beginwithbismillah #continuewithastaghfirullah #endwithallhamdullilah #lahawlawalaquwwataillabillah
