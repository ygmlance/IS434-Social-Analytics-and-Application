Inspired by the burgers they ate during their trip to New York, Zac and BX soft-launched @dirtybunsg about a week ago. They pride themselves in hand-grinding the beef for patties, using their own ratio of fat to chuck and brisket. For me, it’s this that sets their burger apart. Because they strive for coarseness over a fine mince, there is an almost steak-like quality to their patties. Very well seasoned (a little heavy-handed some might say but I am happy with the strong pepper element), and topped with properly melted cheese, the patties did arrive a tad overcooked (likely due to traveling time, just like the lettuce tucked in there), but I still enjoyed my #DirtyBunSg burger a lot. 
The Single Patty version ($8 / $11 as a meal with handcut #fries and a Coke) is alright if you have a small appetite. But to truly appreciate the effort these guys put in for their handmade-from-scratch patties, I say go straight for the Double ($11 / $14 for the meal). Also because the buns are more “bready” than brioche, I feel they perform better in the company of extra meat.
I requested for the housemade sauce (it’s really well-balanced and tasty!) to be served on the side, so I could add on how much I want (a smidgen is my preferred). Plus I get turned off by sauce-soaked soggy buns, something I’ve encountered in the past with other delivered burgers. 
One thing’s for sure, @dirtybunsg offers very good value-for-money food. Do #supportlocalsg business by checking them out if you are into patties of a chunky-meat chew.
