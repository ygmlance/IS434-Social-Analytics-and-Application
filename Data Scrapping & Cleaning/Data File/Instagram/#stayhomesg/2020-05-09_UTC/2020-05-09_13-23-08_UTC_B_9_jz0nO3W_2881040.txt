This is my biggest project this year ~ tea-nner!😂😂 Originally planned to be afternoon tea & dinner, decided to combine both meals together! Since tmr is Mother's Day, and coz of CB, we can't go out for afternoon tea (my favourite meal of the day!), I decided to make my own! And also sent 2 sets to mum & aunty!😉 In this platter, there are sliders, caramelized almond brittles, scones served with twg jelly, mini marble cakes, strawberry tarts, macarons (2 flavours ~ mixed berries & lemon curd) and lemon curd tarts. 
Very satisfied with how it all turned out, but it sure took alot of time making everything from scratch!😊😊 Wishing all super mummies out there a HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!💐💐 #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #homecooking #sghomecooks #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday33 #englishafternoontea #burger
