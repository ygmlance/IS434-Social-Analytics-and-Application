Woke up to the smell of sausage, red peppers, mushrooms and potato hash frying in the kitchen coupled with the smell of fresh coffee beans in the air as the grinder and coffee machine springs into action and my hubs makes me my cappuccino. Yup! Food made with love is the best kind of food! ü•ó

Have a great weekend folks! ‚ù§Ô∏è
