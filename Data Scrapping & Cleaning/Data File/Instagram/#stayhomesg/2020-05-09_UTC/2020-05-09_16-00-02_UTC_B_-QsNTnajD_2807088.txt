If you missed out on yesterday’s Mother’s Day edition of ‘Real Moms of Quarantine’ IG live, here are some my fave funny, sweet, n serious moments. Laughed and learnt so much with these 2 momma’s boys @raozijie and @benjaminkheng last night. Maybe 20 yrs down the road when my son is their age, I will look back at this again n see how I fared. Happy Mother’s Day to all the moms who are celebrated this day! ❤️ #mothersday #realmomsofquarantine #sgunited #stayhomesg
