Going through the SLS with another Sec 1 student!
.
He has some trouble understanding certain concepts delivered over SLS and the teacher does not adopt any online teaching.. The students are required to learn purely from videos and worked examples which I personally do not prefer because there must be a certain guidance which makes learning more efficient to the child.
.
Are you having any difficulties with SLS?
