Roasted Broccolini is my new fav ❤️ and adding grilled corn, aurugula, red cabbage, pumpkin seeds and pan fried tofu makes it a winner salad. Add lemon juice and olive oil to dress it. #plantbasedsalad #easyrecipes #youwillloveit #cookingathome #veganrecipes #nutritionstudies #healthydinnerideas #healthyandtasty #plantbasedcook #instafood #stayhome #stayhomesg #holisticnutritionist #holisticnutritionist #csnn
