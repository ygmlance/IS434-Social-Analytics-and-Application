Take a peek into JCC’s kitchens! One of our staff made Onigirazu(おにぎらず)! Onigirazu is a fairly modern dish that can be thought of as an onigiri sandwich. ⁣
⁣
It originates from the popular manga series “Cooking Papa”, about a salaryman who is secretly a very good cook and enjoys cooking for himself and his family. In one chapter of the comic, he invents Onigirazu, which means “no gripping”, a word play on onigiri, which means “to grip” as traditional onigiri has to be shaped and molded in one’s hands. ⁣

Onigirazu is very easy to make, and one of our staff made it for her dinner last week. She doesn’t eat any meat, so her choice of fillings were avocados, sauteed eringi or king oyster mushrooms and carrots in a mild sweet and spicy sauce, and layered with Japanese rice mixed with toasted black and white sesame. Some popular ingredients for Onigirazu are eggs, cheese, ham, tuna. There’s no right and wrong, so feel free to experiment!⁣
⁣
To make it, take a sheet of nori (for sushi use), add some rice in the middle to form the first layer, then add your preferred ingredients, and add another layer of rice. Then wrap the nori seaweed to form a squarish shape, flip it over and cut in half diagonally with a knife and it’s ready to eat. It is that simple! ⁣
