10 years ago, I was determined not to ever bake a cake again, having failed 3 times in a day; the cake surface was wavy, didn't taste good. I remembered i felt like crying when i was eating it 😂😂😂.
. 
Today I decided to try again. I used whatever materials and equipment I could find. Here are some tips if you want to bake for mother's day! 💕🎂
.
This time I removed the whisk from the standing mixer, so I could mix it evenly. I got flat-top cakes, with no cracks. Yay! 🎉
. 
I used tingkat trays, I didn't have baking pans. Tingkat trays have same size, small, just right for my family and can fit into my oven at the same time! (split the batter into half, and layer them with cream, in my case I chose peanut butter for insurance in case the cream is a failure 😂) 😄🙌🙌
.
The cocoa powder were out of stock, I got cocoa drink powder instead. I nearly wanted to get milo of out desperation and I'm sure it will taste just fine. 😋
. 
If you can't find whipping cream, try whipping coconut cream! So keto-friendly! 🥫

Baking powder was out of stock; I mixed baking soda and cream of tartar to make baking powder.

Low carb friendly! I used almond flour, xylitol (you can also use stevia to replace sugar). xo, Allison
