I look so serious because I mean business that my mama is the best to me in this world okay? Haha actually is kenna forced to wear this because I am sure you know what day it is tomorrow and who’s the boss at home! Also because my ma fully controls my wardrobe 😬 .

According to my mother, tomorrow my father is gonna look after both me and kor kor the whole day while she sleeps in, wakes up at 11am and have breakfast in bed, don’t know true or not. She says he will get the memo after reading this post so let’s see!

Oh and I just turned 13 months old yesterday, the latest word I learnt is “shush”, learnt it from my daddy who told my mummy that. Wonder what that means and why she gave him the death stare, that look is usually reserved for me and kor kor every day when we are misbehaving!
