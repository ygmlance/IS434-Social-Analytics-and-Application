The mothers decide to do some youngster stuff after the girls sleep.
Doing video with mum is actually quite fun.
Using our daily Mofa routine since mama is familiar what's the next move.

My mum's health has got so much better with mofa in this stay home period.
When CB started my mum has to stop her usual routine. She has always been active with long walk, market shopping and so she fall really sick.. was on bed and constipated for days.

Old people are very fragile and they don't like to share on health issues.
Thankfully she has always know the benefits for orange mofa and willing to give a try.
A pink health is the best gift we can provide for our parents and our children.
