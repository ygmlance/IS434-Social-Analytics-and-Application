• ʏᴇʟʟᴏᴡғɪɴ ᴛᴜɴᴀ sᴀʟᴀᴅ - lightly seared & paired with salmoriglio dressing
_
• sᴀʟᴜᴍɪ - mixed artisanal co!d cuts

each dish is here to satiate the occasion, soaring high in quality. 👍🏻get a complimentary cocktail ςίɕίʆίαη ςմηςεϯ (inspired by the fleeting colors of dusk & calm waters of the Mediterranean Sea) with each Mother’s Day set ordered. the set ($170 nett) comfortably feeds 2 to 3 people.
.
be loving & get this done now so all can enjoy the scrumptiousness later. there is no better way to tell Mummy or the Mummy of your child "I love you". save the cooking chore or average meal another day!
