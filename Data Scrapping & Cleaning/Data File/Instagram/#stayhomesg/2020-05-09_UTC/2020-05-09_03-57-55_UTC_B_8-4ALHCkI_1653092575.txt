They say it takes 21 days to form a habit. I've been home for about 72 days now ðŸ˜… and I realised the 2 habits I've cultivated are:

1. To look for something to be grateful for everyday even though on certain days you don't feel there's anything to be grateful for haha. Those are the days which are most important.

2  To always look out my windows for sunsets. This happens everyday and I'm still amazed by it! It makes me take a break from the hectic day and just take a moment to breathe and recharge.

What are the new habits you have formed so far during this #stayhome period?
