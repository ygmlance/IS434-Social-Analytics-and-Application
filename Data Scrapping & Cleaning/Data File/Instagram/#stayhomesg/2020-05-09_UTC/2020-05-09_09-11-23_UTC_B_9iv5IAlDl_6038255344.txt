Seasonal - is Mother's day a season? 
During our #stayhome, cake shops have been told to close til 🤷🏻‍♀️. Decided that I probably could crochet a cake faster than bake an actual one. Here's my mother's day cake. Sent virtually to all the mothers I know. Stay sane, stay healthy, you are awesome. 💪💪💪💪 PS: after it was done, it got taken hostage by my toddler so this was the only pictures I have. 🍰🎂🍥🧁
