Together or apart, let this Mother’s Day be the perfect chance to convey appreciation and good thoughts to the special lady in your life. ⁣
⁣
Send or share Carlton City’s Mother’s Day Specials, as we bring you two uniquely satisfying sets. Envelope the occasion with the warmth of the hearty flavours of the Chinese Set, featuring the Slow Braised ‘Nam Ru’ Chicken Pot with a plethora of accompanying sides. Alternatively, opt for the exquisite Western Set starring Baked Salmon ‘En Croute’ with Scallop Mousseline, an indulgence befitting the occasion. ⁣
⁣
Both sets serve 2-4 persons, and require orders to be placed 4 hours in advance. For more, visit our store at https://carltoncityhotel.oddle.me (link in bio) ⁣
