French toast with fuwa fuwa cloud egg for today brunch. I had the cloud egg on rice in Japan and thought of having it again. This time, I tried it with french toast.

Beat eggs, milk, and sugar.
Soak Gardenia fine grain wholemeal bread in the egg mixture.
Fry it with butter.

Cloud egg
Whisk egg white for 7 mins.
Shape it like a cloud and make a well in the center on the egg toast.
Put egg yolk in the center.
Bake for 3 mins.
