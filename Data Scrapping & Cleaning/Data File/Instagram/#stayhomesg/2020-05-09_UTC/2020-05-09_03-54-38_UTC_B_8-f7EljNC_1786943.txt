Ordered in some @starbuckssg new drinks from the #teaology series! Got the Mango Matcha Freeze and Sangria Hibiscus Cold Brew! ⁣
⁣
There are a total of 5 drinks in the Tealology series and so far I'm def learning towards the Mango Matcha > Sangria Hibiscus. Yes my friends will go like: "omg you prefer mango?!" because I have a complicated relationship with yellowish coloured fruits 😆⁣
⁣
My friend told me their Peach Cloud w/ Jelly is amazing so I def gonna try that next!⁣
⁣
Also, extra points for pretty and reusable cups!
