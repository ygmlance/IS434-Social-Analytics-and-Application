33/56: Almond milk ginger walnut smoothie🥛. This is inspired from a Cantonese dessert I saw @thehedgehogknows made: ginger milk pudding 姜汁撞奶. A very intriguing dessert as the milk will curd from the ginger juice. However, it will never work on plant-based milk,so made into a smoothie🤷🏻‍♀️. It is yummy and soothing for tummy!➡️ test-baked keto chocolate chips walnut cookies again to get ratio and taste right... almost there🤗.#almondmilk #137almondmilk #almondmilksmoothie #ketosmoothie #ketochocolatechipcookies #nosugaradded #ketocookies #ketobaking #ketobakes #ketodessert #ketosnacks #ketocommunity #ketofam #ketosg #ketosingapore #stayhomesg #stayhomebaking #ketolifestyle #lowcarb #姜汁撞奶 #生酮飲食 #低碳飲食
