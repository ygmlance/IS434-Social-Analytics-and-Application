【 Day 3 - 💃Mingle Tangle🕺 】
.
.
This is my second attempt for the string on Day 3. The word "adventure" just came to mind when I see this string.
. 
After completing it, it reminds of me of an experience where I need to cross this suspension bridge made of iron/metal(the photo of the bridge is the one I had to cross) and beneath the bridge it is a fast flowing river. It was a combo of challenges for me as I have phobia for heights and bridges especially suspension bridge. The strong wind made it even more difficult. 😣
. 
Thankfully, with the help of my guide, I managed to cross the suspension bridge with shaky legs, fast beating heart and an almost blank mind.😂
. 
What supposed to be a solo adventure journey really turned out to be one when the first activity upon arriving the kingdom(barely 30 mins from the airport) was to challenge my two phobias. And, I realised that this first activity actually helped to build the "foundation" for more suspension bridges longer in length and taller in height during that journey. . 
Did I managed to cross the other bridges during that adventure journey? It wasn't easy but I did. . 
Is my phobia for heights and bridges gone for good? No, I still have them 😊
.
.
This is one of the  adventures I had, how about you? What is one of your adventures that you had?
