The hand that held on to me for the last 46 years and many more years to come. The hand that prepared and took care of me all these years. The hand that never let go of my hand. The hand I love. The hand I’ll hold on even in public proudly. Thank you Most Beautiful Mummy. Happy Blessed Mother’s Day 2020. I love you to the moon and stars and back to your most lovely hand. #StayHome #StayHomeSG #StayHomeforSG #MotherDay2020 #lovelyHands
