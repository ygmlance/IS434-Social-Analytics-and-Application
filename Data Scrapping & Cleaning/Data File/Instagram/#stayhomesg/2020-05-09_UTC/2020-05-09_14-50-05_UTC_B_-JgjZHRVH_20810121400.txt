Baked wholemeal banana bread topped with almonds!!! Very happy & satisfied from this bake!! Saw this receipe from @fully.famished and its actually from cookieandkate as well (so you can google healthy banana bread by cookie and kate). The bread came out better than expected!!! but the only drawback was that it was quite dry (And plus I mixed in almonds which made the bread even more dry hahaha ðŸ˜…) .
The original receipe is in google or you can swipe left but I decided to make some tweak to the receipe to perfect it for the next bake that I'll be trying again!

1/3 cup of olive oil
1/3 cup of honey
2 eggs
Mashed 3 large bananas
75ml milk
1 tspn baking soda
1/2 tspn salt
1/4 tspn cinnamon powder
1+1/4 cup wholemeal flour

Crushed almonds as toppings & 1 large banana as topping(or decoration)

P.s I did not have a rectangular bread loaf mould so I made do with my square mould HAHAH (looking like a banana cake when it first came out ðŸŒš) .
