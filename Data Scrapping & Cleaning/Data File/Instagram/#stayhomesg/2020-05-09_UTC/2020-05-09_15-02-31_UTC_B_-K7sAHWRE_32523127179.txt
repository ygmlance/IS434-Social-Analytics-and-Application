😋Taste: 9/10. Been lusting after this bombz recipe which we made before and is our favourite way to make pasta. We ran out of spiny lobsters, scallops, and octopus and decided to use more prawn heads and squid to make it up. The flavour was less complex, but still decadent. Halfway through we grated Parmesan, and it was like magic. Highly highly recommend! Will probably make this again before lockdown ends 🙂
