When we set out to get into shape and start to eat healthily and exercise, the question that's on all of our minds is: how long will it take to lose weight and see results?

The safe amount of weight to loss per week is 1Kg.

In order to drop 1kg of fat, we need to burn 7,700 calories.

If we want to lose 1Kg per week, we need to.burn 1,100 calories more than what we eat per day. If you wanna lose 1Kg in a month, you need to burn 260 calories more than what we eat per day.

Rapid weight loss sounds great, but it could be unsustainable. For some people, rapid weight loss can lead to weight gain when they start to eat normally again. 
So there's no magic bullet or pill when it comes to weight loss.

Eating fresh, minimally processed foods and controlled portion sizes is the most effective way to lose weight. 80% is what we eat & drink, 20% is exercise.

Fitness is science not Magic.. Cheers to a healthier you! 🥂
