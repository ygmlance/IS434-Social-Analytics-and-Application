“…meditation is simply the ability to stop suffering in many of the usual ways, if only for a few moments at a time. How could that not be a skill worth cultivating?” ~ Sam Harris in “Waking Up”⁠⠀

Meditation is the practice of training attention and awareness. ⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
We do so by focusing on the sensations we feel, the sights we see and the state of our mind and thoughts. Mindfulness is the most common form of meditation practiced in the West today, alongside transcendental meditation and metta. ⁠⠀

.⁠⠀
Mindfulness, or focussed attention meditation, comes from the traditional Theravada school of meditation and has two goals at its heart, two mental qualities to strive for. ⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
The first comes from the Pali word ‘samatha’, which roughly translates to “tranquility” and is characterised by a steady, composed and concentrated mind present enough to facilitate the second state to occur. The second state comes from the Pali word ‘vipassana’, which translates to “insight” and refers to the development of awareness of our thoughts, reactions, conditionings and so on.⁠⠀
