1. More unilateral moves: cf first clip for some examples⠀
2. This superset is my absolute favorite for 🍑 😁⠀
3. It works for all exercises, not just squats! You can be creative with your pulses (20 at the end of each set or 5 every 3 reps or 10 every 5 reps etc.) AND don’t be afraid to increase the rep range⠀
