While we were all battling the COVID-19 situation on all fronts, the Housekeeping team at #PARKROYALKitchener embarked on a mini project out of their own initiative - to sew 300 reusable masks for the family.⠀
⠀
Special thanks to the Housekeeping warriors for the hand-made masks. Remember to wear a mask when stepping out of the house and practice safe distancing, everyone! ⠀
