9 May 2020 #Day33 of #circuitbreakersg: So glad i managed to grab bread flour prior to circuitbreaker knowing well that homemade pizxa is a staple in our household. And of course, pepperoni and bacon! And my pineapple for a hawaiian pizza ðŸ˜‹

Spot the odd shapes pizza made by my son! Anyone who guess is right must be really smart! ðŸ˜‚
