Every minute spent...

Saturday afternoon doing dumplings... Linnet missed gozya so we get our hands 🖐 🤚 on .
.
One.. two...three... four... end up many dumplings (gozya) made

.
Different shapes, folds, designs but the ingredients remain the same... and the love to prepare each dumplings (gozya) .
.
Steamed & pan fried them for different varieties...
