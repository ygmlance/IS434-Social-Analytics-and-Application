葱油拌面.⁣
Shanghai.⁣
⁣
A few conversations recently centred around travel.⁣
When can we start traveling again?⁣
Where do you want to go once travel restrictions are lifted?⁣
⁣
I miss traveling.⁣
⁣
Gripped by feeling of wanderlust as I recalled our trip to Shanghai last Oct.⁣
It was a non stop eating and bar hopping trip. ⁣
Zero sight seeing. Just eat and drink.⁣
Great fun with great company.⁣
⁣
We had Scallion Oil Noodles 葱油拌面 on several occasions. ⁣
Simple looking but so delicious. Except for one that came highly recommended by a friend and got my other discerning friend curse under her breath the moment she took a bite. It was not great. Don’t worry, we are still great friends with the one who recommended the eatery to us.⁣
⁣
So I decided to look up how Scallion Oil Noodles are made.⁣
Not too difficult. And the taste was really great. ⁣
And then I got upset again and texted my friend “It is quite easy to make delicious 葱油拌面. How did the restaurant you recommended screw this up when we visited”. We had a good laugh.⁣
⁣
So yes, reliving fun travel memories.⁣
⁣
But, when can we travel together again my friends?⁣
