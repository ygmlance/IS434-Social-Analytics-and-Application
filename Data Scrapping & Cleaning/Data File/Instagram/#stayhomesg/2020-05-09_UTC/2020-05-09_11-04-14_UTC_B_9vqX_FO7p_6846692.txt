This is my 2nd attempt at making dumplings. The white color is plain flour. I added in spinach for the green color and carrot for orange color. I wanted to make orange color skin, but it ended up yellow ğŸ˜‚, haha.... probably not enough ğŸ¥• carrots! 
This time, the dumplings ğŸ¥Ÿ look slightly better than the previous ones. ğŸ˜Š
