“And so time over time
What will change the world
No one knows
So the only promise
Is a day to live, to give
And share with one another
See the wisdom
From mistakes in our past
Hear the younger
Generation ask
Why do I feel this way
The promise of a new day...” ~ @paulaabdul ☀️ .

A trip to the shop at my block turned into a wonderful walk around my hood. It was just too hard to resist! This beautiful day beckoned to be enjoyed. ☀️ As I walked and felt the delicious sun on my skin, all wrapped up in cool, gentle breezes, I thought how amazing it is that no matter what happens, the sun still rises & shines. A constant reminder that the promise of a new day is always within our grasp. I shall bask in its rays just a little longer. ☀️ (PS: yes guys i had my mask on! 😷✌🏼) .
