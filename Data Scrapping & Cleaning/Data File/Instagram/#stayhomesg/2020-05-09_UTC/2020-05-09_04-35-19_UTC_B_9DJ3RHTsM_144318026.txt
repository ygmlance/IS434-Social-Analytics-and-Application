Out of the blue, my girl made bookmarks for papa and me. It was interesting how my art making made an impression on her while a boy tried, and got bored, and the other boy wasn't keen at all.
It's okay. Nowadays, the kids do their own things. They figure out how they want to spend their time to play, read or just chill.
For me, i am re-reading You Jin's books. This point on how chinese idioms were memorised and forgotten just for exam's sake resonated with me. Yet, I still think there is value in memorising because without content in us, there won't be materials for creative usage and deeper learning.
I guess the motivation varies from person to person and timing. I used to memorise stuffs for the sake of exams, but I found later in life that those times actually stored a reservoir of hidden knowledge that resurfaced in daily living. During those times, it made deeper sense and meaning. 
Same for art, even though my boys may not have interest in specific art stuffs, the skills and experiences accumulated during their childhood will not be wasted.
I am sure appreciation for aesthetics will be a part of all my kids' lives. Let me encourage you all to value the processes of art making as a form of training the sensitivites of the heart, mind and senses.
I will be sharing a simple and fun holiday cafe art on monday too!
