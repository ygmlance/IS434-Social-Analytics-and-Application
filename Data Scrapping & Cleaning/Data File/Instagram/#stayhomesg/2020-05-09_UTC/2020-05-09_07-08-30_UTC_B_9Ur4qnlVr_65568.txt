Having an oily scalp all my life has always led me to feel frustrated & troubled with fine, flat hair, making it look really lifeless & dull 
In just a quick 1 week of using the new #dovesg Volume Nourishment shampoo, Iâ€™m really happy to see more volume in my hair, making it bouncier, more voluminous! Making me look more vibrant & energised than before! 
My oily scalp is starting to improve too, making it cleaner & less oily, it doesnâ€™t dry out too!

I love how the shampoo is gel-liked , lightweight & most importantly doesnâ€™t have a too overwhelming scent.
