Last night's dinner from @yakkinsg was epic, and easily one of the best we meat-lovers had during this period. Just imagine delicious piping hot meat straight from the grill onto your plates! I am legit still salivating as I type. Swipe to see more!

The meat were all very well-marinated indeed and the kiddos were very satisfied with the food. The disposable grill was easy to use, but do note that you will need a well-ventilated place if you wanna BBQ, and very friendly neighbours too if you stay in HDB.

I must also mention about the dipping sauces too. One dip into the thai chilli sauce instantly gave me the Chatuchuk feel, if you know what I mean. Kiddos will like sweet Japanese dipping sauce for sure too. Trust us, this is awesome! Order here - http://bit.ly/yakkinorders.
