Circuit breaker Day 33: DIY tacos from @slake.sg 👍👍👍 Smoky, charred meats that were clean, unpretentious (no excessive use of oil/sauces). Love the DIY taco concept from this Mother’s Day menu, especially now that it’s all dabao. Choose the what you want in your taco + not soggy + fresh. Prefer the charcoal grilled chicken & pork rendang to the beef, very tasty. They threw in some brownies too (super moist & yummy btw)! If they have these tacos on their regular menu I can see myself ordering it for fam gatherings 😋
