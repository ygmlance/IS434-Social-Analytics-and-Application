Might be a while before we can enjoy dining in at Distrii’s new garden-themed restaurant, but @NalatiSG has launched specially curated takeaway and delivery customisable bentos and an extensive a la carte menu.
🔸
DIY Bento’s start at $8.50, and they are currently having free delivery for Bento’s around CBD postal codes starting 01 to 06, $5 delivery surcharge for other locations. For all other orders, it’s free delivery for CBD postal codes 01 to 06; $15 for all other locations; and free delivery for a la carte orders above $50.
🚚
Aside from their spread of local fare/‘Zi Char’ offerings, they also offer artisan coffee, gelato, MSW durian and even freeze-packed Chilli Crab. DM them via FB or Whatsapp 97106471 to order. 😍 #FindNewFood
