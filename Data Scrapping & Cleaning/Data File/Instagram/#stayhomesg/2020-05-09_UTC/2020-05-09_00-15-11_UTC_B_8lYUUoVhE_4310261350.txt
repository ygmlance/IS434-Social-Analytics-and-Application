This is the mandarin character for "good" (háo). It is composed of two characters - ‘女‘ on the left symbolises ‘woman’ while ‘子’ on the right means ‘child’. .

Together they represent the affection and love between mother and child, which combine to mean ‘good’/‘好’. .

Wishing mothers everywhere a very happy Mother's Day weekend!
