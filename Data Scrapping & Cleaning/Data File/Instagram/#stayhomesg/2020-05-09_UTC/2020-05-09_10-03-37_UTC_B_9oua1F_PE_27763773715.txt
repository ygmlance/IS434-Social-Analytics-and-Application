I had wildflower honey (leftover from my honey cake) and fresh egg whites to use, so I decided to make these green tea honey macarons. 
What did I learn? Most green tea macarons probably have food coloring because green tea doesn’t actually give the macaron a rich green. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

3 egg whites
1/2 cup white granulated sugar 
1 cup almond flour
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 tablespoon matcha powder
Heavy cream
100 g butter
wildflower honey
Dulce de leche ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
