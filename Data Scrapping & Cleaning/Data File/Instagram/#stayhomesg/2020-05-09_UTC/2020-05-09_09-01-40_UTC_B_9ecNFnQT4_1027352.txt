Having fallen hard for @allium.sg’s dishes and dessert in last week’s menu, I couldn’t wait to order their current one the moment it was released. It was a mix of relief and excitement I felt when I saw they had retained a couple of items from the previous menu alongside the new ones. 
So while I got to savour the #Otah (a mousse-like aromatic creation chockfull of prawns and local squid with bits of petai) and the Lamb “Sop Kambing” with spice oil-dressed bread (I‘m glad I trusted Chef @dillon_ngze who assured me the gaminess of the meat would be offset by the abundant freshly-pounded herbs and spices) for the first time ever, I was equally delighted to dig into Allium’s Signature Nasi Liwet and Empress Chicken "Ayam Ungkep” once more. And yes, they were both as wonderful as before. The Tuscan Kale Gulai I had a preview taste of previously, had undergone small tweaks and the latest recipe has @susteniragriculture’s vegetable simmered with dried sole fish and conpoy in a less heavy gravy. It was tasty but I must admit, the original incarnation has my heart. 
For this round of her iconic #Choux Buns, Pastry Chef @lusianadarusman created a heavenly blend of #Kaya and Gula Aren in Vanilla Cream filling that reminded me of a most excellent #Chendol. It’s indeed an outstanding dessert to end the appetising meal on.
