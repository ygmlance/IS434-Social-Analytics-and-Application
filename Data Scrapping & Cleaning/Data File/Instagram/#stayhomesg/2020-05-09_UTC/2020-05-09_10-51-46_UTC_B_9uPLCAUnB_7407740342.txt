COVID-19 is not just a viral pandemic, but a mental health pandemic as well. All of us are facing disruption, but people with mental illnesses facing isolation may be reminded of old wounds and struggle to cope without the face-to-face care and support they’re used to. .
And it isn’t just people with mental health issues. Many have been affected by the rough economy and social distancing measures and need mental health assistance as well. .
With your support, SAMH can better provide these services to everyone in need of it. Together, #WeGiveInSolidarity for mental health to tide over this situation. .
