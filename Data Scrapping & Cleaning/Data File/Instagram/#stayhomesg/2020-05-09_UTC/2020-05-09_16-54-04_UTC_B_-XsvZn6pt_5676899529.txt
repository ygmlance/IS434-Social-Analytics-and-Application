Happy Motherâ€™s Day! ðŸŒ¹
..
This year, we canâ€™t go shopping at malls to buy presents nor celebrate at restaurants with our naggy ðŸ˜† but lovely mothers.  You can of coz order online ( I hope they arrive on time!)
Celebrating Valentineâ€™s Day, Hari Raya and now Motherâ€™s Day in such unusual times is definitely a trying but memorable one.
Love conquers all, we will get thru this.
It was never easy bringing up your kids (now we know), so thank you for all the sacrifices you made for us!
Stay safe and love you, always!
