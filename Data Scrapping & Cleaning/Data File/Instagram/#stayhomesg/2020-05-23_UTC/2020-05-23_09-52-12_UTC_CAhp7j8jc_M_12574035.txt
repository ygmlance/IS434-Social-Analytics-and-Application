Hadi X Boon X Suz

Thank you @Hadi_Sahran for asking me and @boonbaked to be a part of this.

Selamat Hari Raya & Maaf Zahir Batin to all of you. Here's us tryna spread some raya vibes and love. 💝

This is dedicated to everyone who aren't able to be with their family and loved ones this raya and also to those who’ve lost someone dear.

It’s a super short bit that I did really. I've never really written anything decent in malay and you’d know why if you know me well enough. To be honest, I frankensteined my bit out of 86327647632 raya card greetings till it resembled what I had to say in my heart. "Jembatan" and all.

But the talented @razilrazilrazil crafted his bit at the end so beautifully to “sambut” what I wrote, I just can’t deal. -

I feel like the Grinch stole Raya this year.

I didn’t make dalgona coffee, didn’t step into pasar geylang, didn’t eat deng-deng, nor did I buy pillow cases from an FB live auction. I also didn’t buy new baju kurung.

I’m thankful to be home the whole Ramadhan with both my Mom and Dad. Despite all the small bickerings over meals about CB, Netflix series, Trump, recent local violence and over who didn’t throw away the coffee pod last night, I'm still very thankful. Alhamdulillah. "Count our blessings, Count our blessings.” I whispered to myself each time.

To be honest, I still do yearn to hear the "Takbir Raya" like I always do every morning in the mosque on the first day of Syawal. 🌘
