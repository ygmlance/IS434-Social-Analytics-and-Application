But ....... the side effects of Covid 19 isnâ€™t ending just yet ! 
Singapore is adopting a 3 phase stages , Safe Re-opening ,Safe Transition and Safe Nation . 
Phase 1 is expected to last minimally four weeks, or possibly longer. Phase 2 will have to take months, while there is no time limit at Phase 3.

Letâ€™s all do our part to wear our masks and stay home if you are sick , keeping the numbers Low !
