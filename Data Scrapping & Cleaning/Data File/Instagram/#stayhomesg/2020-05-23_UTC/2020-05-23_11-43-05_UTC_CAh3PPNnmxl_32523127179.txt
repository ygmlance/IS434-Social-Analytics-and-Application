Lemon | Raspberry | Yogurt 🍋🍞
.
🍴Overall ease: 7/10
.
🛒Ingredients: adapted from @jocooks to use raspberry instead of blueberry. Wet ingredients - egg, sugar, oil, greek yogurt, vanilla essence; Dry ingredients - flour, baking powder, salt
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process:
1. Whisk together all the dry and wet ingredients into separate bowls
2. Slowly fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture.
3. Coat the raspberries in flour (if frozen, make sure they are defrosted and as dry as possible). Fold raspberries into the wet mixture carefully 
3. Pop the mixture into the oven at 170deg for ~1hr (till a toothpick comes out clean)
4. Leave it to cool before pouring over the glaze
.
😋Taste: 6/10. Not a good bake. Half of my cake sunk due to too many raspberries at that side (& their moisture). Lesson learnt when using frozen berries to better defrost, dry, & separate them out, and to perhaps decrease the amount of berries. Other than that & the slightly moist texture, everyone loved the taste profile 😉
