Sweet potato brownies!!! Found this healthier version of brownies from youtube and really calculated that each piece of brownies is only about 50calories!! üôåüèΩ .

Ingredients: (Makes about one tray/20 small pieces) 
2 medium size purple sweet potato (mashed)
4 tbspn of nut butter (I used 100% natural peanut butter)
4 tbspn of cocoa powder 
2 eggs
2 tspn baking soda
1 tspn of vanilla essence (optional which I didn't add)

Optional toppings:
Chocolate chips 
Crushed nuts

Mix all the ingredients in a bowl and fold in chocolate chips. Pour the mixture onto a baking pan and bake at 200deg for 15-20minutes!

Really easy and fuss free! As there are no sugar being added, taste wise its a litte bland as compared to usual brownies but you can really taste the fragrance of the nut butter! Hence, suggest to fold in some semi sweet choc chips or add honey to your mixture if you would like it to be sweet! Also, this brownie is on a more fudgy side! (I am team fudgy brownies than cakey hehe)

Funfact: the purple sweet potato will actually turn greenish-blue when it is mix w baking soda, thus is changes colour!! .
