Apple Cinnamon Tortilla Roll-Ups are SO much better than regular apple pie. It's crunchy on the outside & filled with delicious cream cheese + warm cinnamon apple filling! Best thing is no frying involve, just baked! The smell of cinnamon will just perfume the whole house and can't wait to dig in. Great as a snacks, desserts or breakfast! .

Ingredient:
• 2 Tortilla Wrap @missionfoods.sg • 4 tsp Cream Cheese for spreading 
Apple Filling • 2 Granny Smith Apple • 15g Salted Butter
• 1 tsp Cinnamon Powder
• 3 tsp sugar (I use Demerara & White) 
Cinnamon Coating
• 30g Melted Butter
• 60g Fine Sugar
• 2 tsp Cinnamon Powder

Prepare the apples by cutting into small cubes, I left the skin on as I still like a little crunch to it. Combine all ingredients in a small pot and cook over small heat until the apples are soften. Set aside.

.
Half the tortilla and spread about 1 tsp of cream cheese on tortilla. This will act as the glue to stick the tortilla together. Spoon about 1 tbsp apple filling and roll it in from the ends. .
.
Dip in the butter then immediately roll into cinnamon sugar mixture. .
.
Place on a baking sheet. Bake at preheated oven at 180°C for 15-18mins or until golden brown. 
Serve warm with additional cream cheese if desired.
