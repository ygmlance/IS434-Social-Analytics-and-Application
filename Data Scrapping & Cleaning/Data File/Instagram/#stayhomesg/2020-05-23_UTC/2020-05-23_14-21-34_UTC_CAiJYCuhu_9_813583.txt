Ramadan this year ends extremely fast. I did not even have time (Bad excuse) praising my Lord more than usual and reading the Quran. But Ramadan this time, is truly a blessing because I spent time at home observing fast, hence not so tired,Terawih prayers and other forms of workship.
.
Keeping myself healthy with doing own hralthy cooking, and tabata session invited by Nicole. The key word is moderation. I cried during broke fast and sahur at times because this year, I stay by myself. Those blessing I did miss alot.
.
However, I want to wish all Muslim friends a safe and blessed Aidilfitri. I will message / video call personally to seek forgiveness and lepas rindu to some of you since we may not be able to meet this year. Don't be surprised. Or you can do the same to me too. .
