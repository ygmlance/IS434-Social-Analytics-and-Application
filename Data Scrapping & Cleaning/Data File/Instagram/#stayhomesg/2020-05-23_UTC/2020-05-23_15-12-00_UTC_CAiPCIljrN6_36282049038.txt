Project “Auntie, Uncle - Let’s sing & dance” is an initiative started by @iammistererick, as he wanted to re-create a song for the elderly to sing along with at home during the circuit breaker. 
After the musicians completed the music, things just started rolling and unexpected support came in. Two local performing communities @juicez.sg and @sohowsg contributed with simple dance choreography and multimedia support. They invited friends and family to “sing and dance” together at home during the Circuit Breaker, making the project more meaningful than the idea originally conceived, as families bonded together in this activity. 
We want to give special thanks to everyone who had volunteered and given their support towards this initiative. We hope that this song brings joy to you and your loved ones. Let’s gather our elderly at home to sing and dance along with this video! 大家一起来唱“为何你爱着别人” 吧！
