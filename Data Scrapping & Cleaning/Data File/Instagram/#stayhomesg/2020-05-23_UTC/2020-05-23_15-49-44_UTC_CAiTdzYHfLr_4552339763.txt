Today, we traveled to Japan as a family since Daddy has 1 hour to spare. Raelyn visited Japan when she was a year old and we spent some time watching those videos. Time flies, she just started walking back then. 
We did a lot of painting about Japan: 🇯🇵 Japan map and flag (Initially she drew a not so perfect circle and daddy decided to drew a perfect circle for her as he explained it is only respectful of us to draw other countries flag nicely. I would have let it go but I thought this is actually a good learning point too) .
🇯🇵 Kimonos bookmarks- printed from @crayola website Each of us painted one and had a mini origami session folding them. Can you guess which one belongs to Raelyn? .
🇯🇵 Making a fan - Raelyn allocated one part of the picture for each of us to paint. Daddy was tasked to paint the clouds and he painted blue only to be corrected by Raelyn that clouds is white and sky is blue! (I always make this mistake too 😅) .
.
🇯🇵 Sakura tree - Using cotton balls , wooden pegs and paint, we created this little painting. 🍣 Last but not least, we read about food from Japanese. Since we have been eating ramen, we had a sushi diy party for today’s dinner.
