Repost from @the.threelittlebears using @RepostRegramApp - Surprised my daughter with this animal crossing bento for lunch. Timmy 🦝 and Tommy 🦝 are make from brown jasmine rice. It has plenty of essential nutrients, which makes it a great choice for bento. 🐟🐠🦞🦋🌴🦑🐜🌷🐝🌼🕷️🐞🦂🦗🌹 Really miss the pretty and romantic cherry blossom season at animal crossing!🌸 Do you miss it too #animalcrossingfandom
