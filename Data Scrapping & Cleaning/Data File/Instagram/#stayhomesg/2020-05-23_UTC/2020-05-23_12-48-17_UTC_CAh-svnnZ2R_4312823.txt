Mexican, Middle Eastern & Brazilian in one table setting.

Dinner today was very wholesome with everything made from scratch! Except the chips. "This turned out exactly like how I had visualised it," I said. 
I'm evidently a planner. When I wanted to do something like this, I will take time to Google, find recipes, read the comments & do up a visual board in my head before the execution. Up till the last hour, I was still googling on how best I can plate it given my limited choices at home.

I mean it when I said I don't halfass anything. And I know that as a fact. And I am proud of it. That also means when I fail, it hits extremely hard. And when I give up, I'm 100% done. But that also means, whatever I do, I give my all & I do it genuinely from my heart. ♥️ .
