[GIVEAWAY✨] I want to be like a caterpillar 🐛. Eat a lot, sleep and wake up beautiful 😝 #daydreaming #stayhomesg
.
How’s keeping up with the kids at home?  Besides having #HBL, we received this Hungry Caterpillar in Mandarin  #busybook from @edithfunhouse - and it was a project that kept me busy 😝 sticking, collating and reading! 📚
.
Their felt cloth craft with instructions provided fun for the boys to make their very own craft book! As the variety of titles from @edithfunhouse are educational, I thought it would be great to share this with all of you at home! 🏠✨
.
So together with @edithfunhouse, we would love for ONE lucky winner to win a DIY craft book of your choice! Choose from fun titles like 三只小猪, 蝌蚪找妈妈 or 丑小鸭! 🦆
