[21.05.20] Day 45 of #circuitbreaker:

School is reopening sooooon! My kids aren’t too enthusiastic about it because they are REALLY enjoying the time they can stay at home. Although work load remains more or less the same since their enrichment classes moved online, they do get more play time since we saved time from traveling to classes. 
So I guess the week rotation between school- and home-based-learning for first 4 weeks of term 3 would work for the kids to ease them back to school again!
