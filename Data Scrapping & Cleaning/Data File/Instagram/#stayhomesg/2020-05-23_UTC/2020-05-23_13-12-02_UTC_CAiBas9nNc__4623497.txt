Damn I’m happy I found the most perfect pizza🍕 crust recipe...EVER! And it doesn’t even require an oven.

I just need flour, baking powder, yogurt... and pan fry it using the same @cookyn.inc recipe the kids used during their online cooking class.

And, thankfully, the kids remembered it, so they could make and knead the dough for me.

I just can’t handle how fluffehhhhhh and soft and fresh the pizza crust is! There honestly is not much point in buying pizzas (always so 💰 when it’s such basic ingredients duh) anymore.
