Pizza on the Grill

It’s no secret by now. Our family (actually mostly my husband) is a pizza fanatic. As we inch slightly closer towards our goal of making our perfect pizza, these are some hacks which worked for us this time.

1️⃣ Used a new dough recipe found on tasteandtellblog. We kneaded minced garlic and rosemary into the dough. We loved the subtle fragrance. Dough credits: @nata.de.kohkoh and @isa.ball 
2️⃣We used 4 types of cheese. Bottom layers, cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan. Top layer, we used raclette. The raclette on top was a game changer. Highly recommend. 
3️⃣ Instead of baking a longer time to get the cheese burnt but sometimes left our crust too hard, we took it out at the 15 mins mark and then blow torched the crust and the top layer of raclette cheese. The result is the amazing smokey aroma of charred cheese and crispy crust. Enough said.
