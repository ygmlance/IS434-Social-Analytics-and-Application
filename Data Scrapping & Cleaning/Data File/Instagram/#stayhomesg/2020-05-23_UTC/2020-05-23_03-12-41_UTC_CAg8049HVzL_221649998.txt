Have a good run today. With good weather. 6km. And lost count on the previous run. So ya... is ok. Just enjoy the run and make use of the time to do more things. Did some jibengong also. To keep myself fit so that when the time come. I will always be ready for any challenge. Stay safe everyone. And fight Covid-19 together!
