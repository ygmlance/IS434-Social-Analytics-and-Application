𝟐𝐍𝐃 (𝐎𝐅) 𝐉𝐔𝐍𝐄 • The Circuit Breaker is coming to a semi-end soon, and hopefully this gives us all a glimmer of light and hope at the end of the tunnel. It’s gonna take a while till we’re completely free to hug, gather, worship together, and other freedoms we used to take for granted, but till then, let’s take it one step at a time: at least we’ll have 2nd June to look forward to.
