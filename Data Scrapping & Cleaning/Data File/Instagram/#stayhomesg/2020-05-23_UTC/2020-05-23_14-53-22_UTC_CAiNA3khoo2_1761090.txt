Ahlan wa Sahlan, my friend & #EidMubarak to you! ðŸŒ™ Heavily inspired by my big brother, @zayne81â€™s recent post (miss doing matching looks on the floor) and tapping into my Arabic heritage, I came up with this #genderneutral look. I used colours from the #MACArtLibrary palette #NudeModel, #KohlPower pencil in #Feline & the #MACMosaicMasterpiece edition of In Extreme Dimension #3DBlack mascara. Stay tuned for the video releasing tomorrow! #MACCosmetics #MACCosmeticsSG #MACAPACArtistry #MACArtist #MACMyDay #MACMeUpSG #TrendMACUp #MLYB #StayHome #StayHomeSG #CircuitBreaker #CircuitBreakerSG
