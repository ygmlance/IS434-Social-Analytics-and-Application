😅my first carbonara pasta. Instead of bacon, i used luncheon meat 😋 Cook the pasta for about 20mins cos realised it's wheat pasta which needed slightly longer time to cook. Mix eggs with grated cheese and cook together with the pasta. The texture turns out gau gau which i quite like it hahaa... so happy that @yuhngg4657 ate allll... 🈵足感💯.
