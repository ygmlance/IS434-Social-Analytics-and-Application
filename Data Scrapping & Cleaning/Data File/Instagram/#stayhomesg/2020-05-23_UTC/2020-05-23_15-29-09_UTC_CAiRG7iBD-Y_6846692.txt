Baking this Basque Burnt Cheesecake at night is the best time as after cooling, you can just keep in the fridge overnight and it will be ready by the next day. You can enjoy it then for high tea right away. 
I baked it again last night and followed the recent recipe that I had used. This time I used Anchor cream cheese for a change, although I personally prefer the Philadelphia one. The Anchor cream cheese tasted not too bad! 😆
I have never done baking before and I have been doing lots of it recently during this Circuit Breaker period. I think I have fallen in love with it! 😍
