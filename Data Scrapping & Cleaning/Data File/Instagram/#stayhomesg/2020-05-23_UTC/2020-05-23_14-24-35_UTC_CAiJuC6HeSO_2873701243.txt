Mala kind of evening. I love the punchy kick from this Sichuan boiled fish. It’s chockfull of vegetables and generous portion of tender fish fillets, spicy and addictive. Wan Xing is still my fav mala xiang guo place so far.

They’re open till early morning (3am which is great for supper) and I got mine delivered by @foodpandasg
