Selamat Hari Raya to our Muslim friends! 
Albeit a little different from the usual Raya - missing the visiting, festivities, and probably delicacy from your loved ones, we hope that you still get to enjoy this Raya together with your family at home 💚 
For the heroes who need to be out there in this period, thank you and we appreciate you ☺️
