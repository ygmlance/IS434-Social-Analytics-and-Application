Now that Ramadhan is over, I would like to wish Selamat Hari Raya 2020 in advance to those who are celebrating it! This year’s Raya is going to be slightly different compared to previous years but it’s okay, guys. We can all play our part in flattening the curve by staying at home for this year’s Raya. 🙆‍♀️ .

And yes, in regards to the picture above, it’s a drawing of me holding a ketupat lol.
