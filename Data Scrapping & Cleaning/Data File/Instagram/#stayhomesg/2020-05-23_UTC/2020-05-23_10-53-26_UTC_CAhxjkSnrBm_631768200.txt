Day 47 of Circuit breaker dinner.
My intention is to get groceries and on the way get takeaway vegetarian food from the hawker centre. However the vegetarian stalls all closed. They only sell morning & lunch hours.
I faster buy my groceries and headed home to cook purple sweet potatoes porridge again.
Boil a Tofu and some broccoli. Topped up with braised peanuts & beancurd sheets which are balance from my breakfast.
No waste. ðŸ˜Š

P/s - i like this packaging of Tofu. Is 2 serving. The other serving can keep. No need to waste time to find a container to put and have to wash again.
