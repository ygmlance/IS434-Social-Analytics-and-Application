[22.05.20] Day 46 of #circuitbreaker:

I’ve a number of friends and IGers asking me about the Nagomi art workshops I’ve been attending so I thought of consolidating my answers to the FAQs here: 
Q: What is Nagomi art? 
A: Nagomi art is a form of painting using soft pastels and fingers. Yes, you read me right - your fingers!

Q: Where do you find the workshops? 
A: @artpeacesg - Audrey and her instructors have been most generous during this circuit breaker. They organise free workshops and charity drives so that people staying at home can learn something new and help others in need as well. 
Q: Can kids attend the workshops? 
A: Yes, as long as your kids are comfortable with Zoom classes and can follow instructions in English/Mandarin. I saw many kids of primary-school-going-age attending these workshops and they came up with beautiful pieces!

Q: Do you need prior experience? 
A: Nope, but it would be easier for you to follow if you have materials from the starter kit. 
Q: Where to get the starter kit? 
A: Check out @artpeacesg’s shop on their website. Alternatively, there’s also @overjoyedxyz but I think they take much longer to deliver. 
Q: Omni or Faber Castell better? 
A: I’ve only just started trying out Omni’s and was using Faber Castell’s previously. Personally, I prefer the Faber Castell starter kit because it provides the bookmark size paper as well. I find their pastels slightly softer than the Omni ones too. 
Feel free to leave a comment / DM me if you have any more questions, or information about Nagomi art workshops to share!
