3-Ingredients Black Pepper Chicken Don? 😋🍱
Hehehehe, got my quick meal fix with CP Pepper Kicks and it is so simple!👍🏻👍🏻
Made up of cooked chicken leg meat,  you can simply use the CP Pepper Kicks by immersing the bag in boiling water for 7 minutes or microwave it on a microwavable plate. You can use it to stir fry with some vegetables. I served mine with some brown rice and onsen egg. So simple but so sinful peppery!
