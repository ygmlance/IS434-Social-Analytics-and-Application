Sammich for lunch - prepared from katsu from the freezer, fresh greens and tomatoes, homemade egg mayo (added too much mayo, so itâ€™s more liquidy - oops) and cheese, stuffed into @oldsengchoong ciabatta and pulled together by their magnificent truffle butter. 
Last two items purchased from @misstamchiakâ€™s FB Live session! ðŸ¥°
