I forgot to include vegetables in my meal earlier on.
So i made a small size salad with lettuce,  cherry tomatoes and dried cranberries.
Drizzle with lemon juice.
I had bananas too. ðŸ˜Š
Last pic shows the brand of lettuces i have been using for this salad and making sandwiches.
I find this cranberries are best to eat with salad.
Otherwise will be too sweet.
That's why i only used lemon juice, freshly squeezed. No extra sauce that are sugar added.
Lastly i had a cup of hot green tea too. ðŸ˜Š
