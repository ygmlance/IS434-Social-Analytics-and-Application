⠀⠀
Tumbled stones, galets and palm stones are very well-suited for meditation, laying on the body and for daily use as a healing stone or as a 'lucky stone' carried in the pocket. They possess high vibrant energies and penetrate into the body, supply us with a high level of healing power, protection and intuition when we use them.

Tumbled stones can be used in a crystal grid, which is a placement of crystals in a pattern that creates an increased vortex of energy. ⠀
