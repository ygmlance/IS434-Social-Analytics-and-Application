8 more days to the end of CCB and into Phase 1 of re-opening our economy!
This stay-home period requires FOOD! 😂
My 3 little ones are our panel of culinary judges daily!
We whipped up Katsu-Don, Prawn pasta, Chicken Laksa, Breakfast Eggroll/wrap, Ramen with fried chicken nuggets, Hokkaido pancakes, Bak Kut Teh, Hokkaido Wagyu Beef Burgers and we had full, satisfied tummies and big grins. 😋
This CCB brings us time for reflection and helps many of us to realize the simplicity of happiness. (One of them is having family meals together.)
These pictures will remind me, in time to come, how we got through this adversity together. ❤️ #covid19circuitbreaker #sgunited #maskup #stayhomesg #staysafestayhome #homeactivities #bebetterthanyesterday #treasurethemoments #creatingmemories #clarelyx #joshualyz #jacoblyh #cherylhotraveldiary #sgmummy #motherof3 #familylifeambassador #mrssingaporeuniverse2014
