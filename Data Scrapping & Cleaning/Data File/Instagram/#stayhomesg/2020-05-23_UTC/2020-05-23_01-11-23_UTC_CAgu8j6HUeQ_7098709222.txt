Today’s special breakfast : roast chicken with kimchi wraps! 😋 Had some roast chicken shreds leftover 2 days ago and decided to use them up this morning. It was gone in less than a minute. 😅

Ingredients for 2 wraps :
- 2 portions of roasted chicken shreds
- 1/4 rice bowl of kimchi portion (or an amount to your preference)
- 1/2 rice bowl of cucumber, julienned (or an amount to your preference)
- mayonnaise for dressing

I gave the roast chicken and kimchi a quick stir fry to warm it up with a little bit of oil. And proceeded to wrap them up into our tasty, super refreshing and tangy breakfast for champs! 💪🏻 #whatadeloves #sgbreakfast #breakfastwrap #adecooks #homecooked #food #foodpics #igfood #foodstagram #yummy #homecooking #sgfood #cooking #sgcook #chefathome #circuitbreakersg #eatathomesg #stayhomesg #perfecttogethermissionfoodssg #perfecttogether @missionfoods.sg missionfoods.sg
