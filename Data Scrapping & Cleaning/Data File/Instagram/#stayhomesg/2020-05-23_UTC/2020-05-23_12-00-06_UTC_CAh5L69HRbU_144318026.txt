This #circuitbreaker broke my records for baking big time! I've never baked beyond the few recipes I had all these years.... Instead of my usual blueberry orange chocolate chips cupcake, I decided to try Beth's banana muffins. Her youtube channel is Entertaining with Beth. Because hubs like oatmeal raisins cookies, my sis sent me Beth's  ultimate raisin oatmeal cookie. So from cookies, I ventured into oats crumbled topping banana muffin and choc chips, almonds toppings. 
With kids helping, we tend to over beat the batter. Nontheless, the recipes are good enough for our kids!
One thing I really thank God for - my kids eat everything I cook. It helps that since young they've been trained to eat whatever is plated.
So these bakes are luxurious treats for them?!ðŸ˜‹
