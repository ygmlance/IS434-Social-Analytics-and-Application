Honestly I do feel weird celebrating Eid this year. For the 1st time we will be doing #stayhome Eid Mubarak. I miss visiting my family and enjoying eating Eid goodies but we need to obey the rules right?! 😝

Here's wishing all muslims around the world a blessed Eid Mubarak and pray all of us will be free from Covid-19. Stay safe everyone. 🥰 #stayhomesg #eidmubarak 2020
