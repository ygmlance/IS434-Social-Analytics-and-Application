This year Ramadhan was very different but precious. Indeed this Circuit Breaker was a blessing in disguise. 30days (more or less due to work) was spent with my family at home (couldnâ€™t ask for anything else better than this). This year, time pass really fast. Wished it could slow down a bit, so I could admire every wrinkle on my parents face that Iâ€™ve failed to noticed while I was busy hustling at the zoo and my other past jobs. 
I hoped many of you took advantage of this Circuit Breaker to reconnect with yourselves and your families. 
This is me, being very extra and still finding joy during this Ramadhan and Eid despite the COVID! 
Oh and this was just outside my house and I didnâ€™t wear a mask for the sake of this photo. 
Finally a new postðŸ˜‚
