Had a delicious meal with these fiery dishes sent over from @eurothaikitchen and @euromalahouse. Their red creamy tom yum was really tasty, filled to the brim with lots of seafood and mushroom. The broth is a perfect balance of spiciness (i asked for mild spicy!), saltiness, sourness and sweetness! If you love fried rice, try their pineapple rice made fancy with large prawns, cashew nuts and more - sooo flavourful. Also, for mala lovers don’t miss their range of mala dishes such as the mala baby lobsters and mala chicken wings, both dishes were really fragrant with that spicy, numbing kick. 
Euro Thai Kitchen and Euro Mala House is a one stop destination featuring best of both cuisines — authentic Thai and Mala dishes under one roof! Enjoy complimentary islandwide delivery for orders above S$40 or a S$10 charge for orders lesser than that. Walk in customers get 20% off takeaway at their store.
