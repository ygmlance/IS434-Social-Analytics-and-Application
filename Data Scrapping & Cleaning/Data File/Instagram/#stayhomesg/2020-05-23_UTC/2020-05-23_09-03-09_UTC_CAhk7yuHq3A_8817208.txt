Mum guilt is real. Really upset that I had to leave my kids in front of the tv for hours while I tried to clear work during some days in the past week. So decided to engage in a lot of activities with them this long weekend. 
Came across @pororoparksg and @tayostation #stayhome honey cereal cookie baking activity and did it with the kids. They enjoyed it and got to munch a lot in between (I wondered why my ingredients kept disappearing). We had fun experimenting with different flavours of @post_cereals cookies and eating them (they're really gooddddd!) 1) @oreo cereal cookie
2) Heart-shaped cereal cookie with @loacker_singapore blueberry yoghurt biscuit bits (got this idea after see @princessezyt post - thanks for sharing!)
3) @cadburysg dream white choc cereal cookie
4) almond cereal cookie
5) @mmschocolate cereal cookie
6) yupi fruity gummy cereal cookie
7) @nutella cereal cookie
