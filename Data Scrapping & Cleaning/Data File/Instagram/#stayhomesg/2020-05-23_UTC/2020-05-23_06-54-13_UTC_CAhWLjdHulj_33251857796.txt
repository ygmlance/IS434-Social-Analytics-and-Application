The man in the house has finally gone digital!! Also my new free Samsung toy that just got delivered 😁😁 We have been subscribing to The Straits Times since we moved in & when the ST News Tablet came up last year my proposals to go digital (so I could get a free tablet) were turned down, because old habits die hard right?

Well, 1 thing we learnt now is that Covid (not CEOs/CIOs/CTOs 🤣) led the digital transformation for all organisations & our home is no exception 🎉 Eliminating non-essential delivery, contact with newspapers, garang guni visits or piling newspaper towers. Plus environmentally friendly & the introductory price at $24.90 is actually cheaper than our current subscription of $32.90. What!? I was enraged when I found out we were paying $8 a month at the expense of my free tablet 👎🏻

SmartyPence Tip 💡
Switch from physical papers to the 2-year Straits Times News Tablet package at $24.90/month & get a FREE Samsung Galaxy Tab A worth $398!! To maximize your subscription (1 tablet, 1 mobile & 1 desktop access), I shared the the desktop access to my parents so that they can keep up with the news since they can't go out and buy their daily papers now ✌🏻
