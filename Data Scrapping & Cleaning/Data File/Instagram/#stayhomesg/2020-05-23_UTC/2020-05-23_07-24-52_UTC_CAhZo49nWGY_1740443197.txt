For this week's #EVVIRTUALGAMESNIGHT, the team headed back to school at Eaglesview Academy to see if they have what it takes to pass their examinations. The examiners @calvintkw_ and @heyrenahere tested the team on their English and Drama skills through finishing the lyrics to National Day songs and forming unique shapes with together using their arms respectively. Needless to say, everyone passed with flying colours and graduated with a Certification of Graduation at the end of the day. Lastly, with Group Excellence scoring a grade C, they got awarded with a forfeit.

Thank you to our special guests @zimah_isnin_ , @jeric_koh and @nailenitselec for taking time off your busy schedules to join us at Eaglesview Academy.

Shoutout to @calvintkw_ for hosting his first ever games night!
