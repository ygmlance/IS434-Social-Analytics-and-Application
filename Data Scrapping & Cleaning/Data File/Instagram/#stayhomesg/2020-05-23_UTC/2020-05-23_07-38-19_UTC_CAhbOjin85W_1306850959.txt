🌈The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little stardust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched. 🌈  Do you feel the same way? If you looked back on your daily life, it’s stagnant, boring and insignificant. But after sometime, you will realize that you did accomplish something over that “dull period” unknowingly. So, just be patient. Results will show over time once you persevere on. Just keep going and improve slowly. Today, I’m eating my home baked butter cake! It’s really tasty according to people who have tried! ☺️☺️☺️So I figured if I open a cafe, it will be one of the specialities! Also took the opportunity to practice on my chocolate art letterings. Letterings are actually more challenging than drawing! So I guess my “Jw’s Cafe” will appear quite often and maybe with different versions of cafe logo. Do you like this balloon logo? It is something I used to draw very often when I was young. 🤩 Happy Saturday everyone! 🎈🎈🎈
