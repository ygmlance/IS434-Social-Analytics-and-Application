Angel Aura Quartz ‚†Ä ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Angel Aura Quartz Crystal is a high vibration stone created from the result of a special coating process (CVD) involving platinum and silver. The resulting Angel Aura Quartz Crystals exhibit brilliant, dazzling flashes of iridescent rainbow colors on silvery surfaces. At first, the quartz crystals are heated to extremely high temperature then vacuum coated with fine vaporized precious metals. The result is that these metals bonded to the crystal‚Äôs surface creating the angelic rainbow sheen that is a hallmark of Angel Aura Quartz. The resulting crystals exhibit brilliant, dazzling flashes of iridescent rainbow colors on silvery surfaces.

The resulting quartz crystals have very powerful metaphysical properties.

These crystals resonate strongly with a vibration that aids insight and connection with the divine realms. Angel Aura Quartz is also known as Opal Aura Quartz Crystal. Angel Aura Quartz Crystal is named after the gossamer angel wings and the energetic connection to the Angelic Realms. ‚†Ä
