We had Set B for 2 pax, presented with high quality poultry 🐓, beef, freshest seafood ingredients such as fish fillet🐟, prawns🦐. With a healthy balance of mushrooms and vegetable🥬🥕 combos! For the soup base, we had Chicken🐣 soup.

It's your call, to have your food delivered raw, or cooked! For us, we opted for raw food. The meticulous staffs prepared generous portions of condiments for us as well! So there's nothing to worry about even if 🍽 dining-in is not permitted, as they have got everything covered!

There's many varieties of soup bases on their online menu. Overall it was a hearty & delish meal, all done at the comfort of our 🏠🍫home!
