If you thought pulling off your own Japanese meal was impossible and that you need years of professional training, we're here to tell you that it isn't. All you need are the right ingredients + the creativity to put it together.

Need some inspiration? Check out @mongabong’s recent DIY dinner. Using ingredients such as Hokkaido uni, ikura, mentaiko, sashimi-grade scallops & negitoro (minced tuna), she was able to replicate a fancy-schmancy Japanese dinner right from the comfort of her kitchen.

A BIG thank you to Mongchin for your kind support 🙌🏻 We hope to be of service again real soon!
