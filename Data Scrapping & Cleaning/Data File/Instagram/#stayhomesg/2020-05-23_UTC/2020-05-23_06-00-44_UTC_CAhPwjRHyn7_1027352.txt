I have not had that many pasta kits during this Circuit Breaker but One-MICHELIN Starred @buonaterrasg’s is marvelous in every sense of the word. 
Firstly, it is super easy to prepare, and this says everything coming from someone who doesn’t really cook. Besides the fact that the ingredients for each dish are measured out and packed together in a box, there is a card with a QR code included for scanning. Doing so leads to Executive Chef @denislucchi popping up on your phone to guide you through the cooking process via a video.
There are three kinds of fresh housemade #pasta and sauces to choose from. Whether you prefer finer strands or broad ribbons for your pasta, #BuonaTerraSG has you covered. Their precise instructions help ensure the texture for each type is done exactly al dente too. You can also purchase extra portions of the pasta at $8 each.
Of the sauces, I love the Al #Pesto ($32) the most as it assails your sense of smell and taste with the most amazing aroma and flavour of fresh herbs. The tomato-based #Amatriciana ($32) is a close runner-up. For seafood lovers, the Sicilian and Alaskan Crab ($38) is suitable.

You can purchase the #PastaKit and check out the rest of their Takeaway Menu by tapping on the link in @buonaterrasg’s bio.

Thank you very much @abbey_thebolobao for sending this hearty and very enjoyable meal to me.
