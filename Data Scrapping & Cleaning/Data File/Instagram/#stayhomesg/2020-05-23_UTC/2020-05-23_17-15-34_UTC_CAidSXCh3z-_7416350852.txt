We want to thank all our frontliners and essentials workers, by spreading awareness to our children, the importance of their roles. 
Often and even now, there is a stigma to certain jobs, that we grow up to shun away from or do not pay attention to. In light of this crucial time, they are our support system who are taking risks and much more of their valuable time to work, so that we can stay at home and function as normal. Always be kind to people next to you, no matter who.
Thank You to the Frontliners and the Essential workers who grind so hard for our country! ❤❤❤ #sgunited #socialdistancing #globalartsingapore #globalart #thinkcreative #sgparents #sgkids #stayhome #stayhomesg #frontlineworkers #essentialworkers #globalart #globalartsg #globalartbishan #globalartbsn #arts #artistic #drawing #artenrichment #coloring #oilpastel #painting #art #postercolor #gclay  #fun #artschool #artwork #artworks #loveart  #decoart
