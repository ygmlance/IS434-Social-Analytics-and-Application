These are like my lifelines in little packs for many months now. Started taking it to supplement my weight loss efforts but I've gained so much more during this time. Fat loss, yes, but my SLEEP has been so much better too, and I really didn't expect that!

I am a light sleeper and always find it hard to fall asleep. Even when I do, it's like "surface sleep", if you know what I mean!

Anyway, shared that to also let you know that it's Freebie Saturday again!  20 days worth of free ketones will sent to you, wherever you are, if you're picked!

All you got to do is:
1. Follow my account
2  Like this picture 
2. Direct message me you wanna try this!

I will send you the contest details! Again, don't worry, there are privacy settings in place. Just DM me! ⭐⭐Contest ends at 11pm SGT, tonight, 23  May (11am ET). xx
