Excellent Tonic for Glowing Skin #Herbal_Soup

Vegetarian bakkuteh taste so well with raddish and kelp! ðŸ¥°

Note: In the early 1940â€™s Bak Kut Teh was served to cater fellow early Chinese immigrants who were working in Port Swettenham(present Port Klang), and this dish serves as a tonic soup to replenish their energy and boost their health.
