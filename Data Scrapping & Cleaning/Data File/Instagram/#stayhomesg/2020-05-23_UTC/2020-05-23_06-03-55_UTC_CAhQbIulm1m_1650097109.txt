Months ago, when covid19 was first shutting down businesses in Singapore, I started this project called Mapping Fear with @ohcy . Fear has always been an emotion that troubled me. But what were other people afraid of? What did fear feel like for them? Now these questions seem more pressing than ever. I wanted to find human connections through this difficult emotion. I thought perhaps if we all drew out our fear, perhaps we could see the overlaps and come to understand it better.
