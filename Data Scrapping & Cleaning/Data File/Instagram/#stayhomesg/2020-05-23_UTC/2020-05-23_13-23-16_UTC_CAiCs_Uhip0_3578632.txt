用不平凡的爱，做平凡小事2⁣
⁣It is heart breaking to see so many migrant workers are being infected by Covid-19 because of the government doesn’t care much before. ⁣
⁣
Donated 800 bottles of sanitisers and spent our day at SGcare Center to pack care pack and distribute food for migrant workers today. ⁣
⁣
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back. ⁣
⁣
The world is sick, ⁣
but we can make a better world for everyone! ⁣
⁣
Make more people smile. ⁣
Give more love.⁣
Help more people when you can💛⁣
