I wrote this song when I had an epiphany that even in the rain, the sun still shines the same. Hope this serves as some encouragement that even in times like these, all hope is not lost - it still shines through the dark. Hang in there everyone, we’re almost there :)

Rain, rain, won’t you go away?
The sun is out but you’re still here to stay.
Rain, rain, why won’t you leave?
I’m sitting here waiting for a chance to breathe.

I look into the almost blue sky 
And wonder why you’re still here.
Where is the sunshine after you?

Rain, rain, I still hear you.
You’re dripping cold from skies above.
Rain, rain, do I still need to be near you?
You consume my thoughts and all I’m dreaming of.

I look into the almost blue sky 
And wonder why you’re still here.
Where is the sunshine after you?

Perhaps in the rain the sun will shine much brighter
For the flowers to bloom and grow.
And the rainbow will start to take its form
To remind me that You’re beautiful.

Till then I’ll be sitting here waiting 
Patiently
Until the day Your light shines through.
