[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Tonight's dinner. Comfort food for the soul.❤️
.
@PuTien_SG's Lor Mee 🍜 (S$9.30, split into 2 bowls) with 2 Tokyo Chicken Stews from @TheSoupSpoonSG (1 not pictured here as there was a very hungry one this evening 😅).
.
PS: There's a 1-for-1 going on at Soup Spoon (now S$9.90 for 2 large bowls)! 😄
