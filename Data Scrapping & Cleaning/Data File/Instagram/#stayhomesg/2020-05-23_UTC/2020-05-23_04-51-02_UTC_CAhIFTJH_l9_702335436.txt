Daulatabad. Maharashtra, India. Sep'12

Originally known as Devgiri, the city was built in the 12th century by the Yadava Dynasty as the site of their capital. It was subsequently named Daulatabad by the Delhi Sultanate ruler, Muhammad bin Tughlaq. He disastrously marched the entire population of Delhi 1200 kilometers south to set up a new capital in Daulatabad, before realizing that the arid region had no reliable water source to sustain an entire capital.

Today in Maharashtra state, the ruins of the site include a defensive fort, a tower reminiscent of the one in Delhi, temples and wall structures. The fort which sits high above the surrounding region, on a hill surrounded by a large rock outcropping, has ramparts, several floors, passages that tunnel through the interior and even a moat!

In the photo, I sit with one of the cannons that used to fortify the citadel. I visited Maharashtra to see the many impressive historical sites around the state. These include the important Ajanta and Ellora Caves, which in my opinion are definite must visits!
