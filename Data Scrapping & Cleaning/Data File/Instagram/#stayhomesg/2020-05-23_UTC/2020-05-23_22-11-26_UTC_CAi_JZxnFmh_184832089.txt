That face,
upon knowing phase 1/3 (i.e. “safe reopening”) post SG’s Circuit Breaker is just prolonging Circuit-Breaker for a few more weeks 🙄

Grocery shopping is still a challenge even till now, because some goods are not getting replenished. I’ve been stupidly waiting for Farmland’s frozen fries (cus that’s the closest cheaper alternative to MCD fries) to be restocked at my neighborhood’s supermarket for weeks, before realizing that they are readily available online (e.g. Shopee)🙄I should really practise #ShopeeFromHome more frequently.

Anyways, this is a really good deal for new #ShopeeSG account users (if only I have unlimited mobile lines 😝):
👉🏼 Enter code “SHOPEE6583M” during checkout to enjoy $7 off*
*Minimum purchase of SGD15. Expires on 31 May 2020, 23:59.
