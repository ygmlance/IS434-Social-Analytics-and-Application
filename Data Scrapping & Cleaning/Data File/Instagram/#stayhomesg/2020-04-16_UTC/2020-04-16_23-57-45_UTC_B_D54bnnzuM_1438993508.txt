MY FIRST TIME MAKING SOUFFLE PANCAKES!!!
Proceeded to tell John that I'm never going to have to go to a cafe to queue for this anymore because I can make it taste even better myself LOL. It is THAT easy and tasty! Got this recipe through @blogilates the other day but I modified it a little with an extra tbsp of flour to stabilise the pancake. The first batch with less flour was a little too soft and had no structure for me! 
You need to try this!!! *Disclaimer: pancakes could be higher if you followed the aluminium foil method Cassey did, but I was too lazy and my lid was shallow LOL  #homebaker #homebaking #soufflepancake #soufflepancakes #fluffypancakes #bananapancakes #stayhome #eathealthy #lowcarb #eatwell #eatwellbewell #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg
