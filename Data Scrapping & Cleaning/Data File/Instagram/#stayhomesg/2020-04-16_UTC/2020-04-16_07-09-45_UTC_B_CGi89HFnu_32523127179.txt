Lemon Rosemary Sea Salt Sourdough 🍞
.
🍴Overall ease of cooking: 3/10

🛒Ingredients: 15% whole wheat, starter, plain flour, lemon, rosemary, sea salt
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: A 36 hour affair as with all our sourdoughs. We worked with 80% hydration in a drive towards an open crumb structure, but that meant dealing with a challenging wet and sticky dough. Glad we made the decision to keep stretching and folding till we were satisfied with the structure, before we left it to bulk ferment overnight.

😋Taste: 10/10. By far our most successful sourdough bake - ah the joy from nailing it! There was an excellent crust and great flavour profile - tangy but also bright with citrusy salty notes. The only thing we wanted more was a greater rise and a slightly more open crumb structure. But at this stage of our journey, we could not be more pleased! ☺️
