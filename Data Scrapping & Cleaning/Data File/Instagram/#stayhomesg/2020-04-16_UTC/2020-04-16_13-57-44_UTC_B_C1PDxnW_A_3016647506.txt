Here are a bulk of the parcels we shipped out today! We make it a point to pack and ship them out the following day as soon as the orders come in. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
However, we’ve received notice that SingPost and other third party courier services are overwhelmed since the circuit breaker announcement started. But please rest assured that they are trying their best to expedite the deliveries as humanly possible and as best as they can! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
We’d like to seek everyone’s understanding and patience as you may have to expect your parcels to come in a week later or so. ⁣
⁣
While you’re waiting for your parcels, you can take advantage of our islandwide cold drinks delivery from Monday to Saturday (excluding public holidays)! It’s a flat fee of $5 per location, with no minimum order. ⁣
