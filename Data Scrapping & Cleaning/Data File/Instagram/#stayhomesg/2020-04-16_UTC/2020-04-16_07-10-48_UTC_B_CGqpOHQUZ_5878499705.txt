So- As you can see, I've gotten on the Dalgona bandwagon to check out the hype.
.
What's the verdict? I highly recommend an electrical whisk, if you don't have one, prepare to have an arm sore-ingly good time.
.
Is the effort worth it?  Yeh sure, once in a while but I can't imagine myself putting in this much work every morning for a cup of coffee.

I liked it alot though. It was nice, light & frothy with a hint of bitterness & I really enjoyed it! So, if you've got some spare time (who doesn't nowadays?), you should try making some Dalgona coffee too! ðŸŒš
