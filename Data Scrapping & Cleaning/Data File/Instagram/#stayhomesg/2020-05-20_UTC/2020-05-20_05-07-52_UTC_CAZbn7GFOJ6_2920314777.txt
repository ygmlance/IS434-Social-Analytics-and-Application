New Norm: Still need to cook ...
Won't be so soon that I can dine at restaurants, so I cooked a dish that I love at Nature Cafe - Braised Bean Paste with Cabbage. My is simplified - cabbage, carrot, mushroom and beancurd Skin with fermented beancurd. At Nature Cafe, this dish has yam, golden needle vegetable, bean vermicelli, if I remember correctly.
