My double patties burger was decent, not outstanding and the whole buying process was pleasant. Reasonably priced, the pickles and sauce were good but fries arrived soggy (which was expected).

I might do a return purchase, only to determine if this was a fluke or how things really are given they’re new. Even so I wouldn’t go all out to convince anyone they absolutely need to try it.
