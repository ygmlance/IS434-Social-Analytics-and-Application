12 more days to the end of COVID19 Circuit Breaker period and into Phase 1 of re-opening our economy...
This stay-home period requires patience... lots of patience. It also brings us time for reflection and helps many of us to realize the simplicity of happiness. We take a walk in the park weekly, discovering what Mother Nature offers along the way. We learn yoga, made up our own games and of course, had HBL (Home-Base Learning). I am truly grateful for the HBL sessions planned by their loving teachers. It taught me how I can improve teaching my children too. At the end of the day, our bed is often ‚Äúinvaded‚Äù by the 2 little boys.üôÇ
These pictures will remind me, in time to come, how we got through this adversity together. ‚ù§Ô∏è #covid19circuitbreaker #sgunited #maskup #stayhomesg #staysafestayhome #homeactivities #bebetterthanyesterday #treasurethemoments #creatingmemories #clarelyx #joshualyz #jacoblyh #cherylhotraveldiary #sgmummy #motherof3 #familylifeambassador #mrssingaporeuniverse2014
