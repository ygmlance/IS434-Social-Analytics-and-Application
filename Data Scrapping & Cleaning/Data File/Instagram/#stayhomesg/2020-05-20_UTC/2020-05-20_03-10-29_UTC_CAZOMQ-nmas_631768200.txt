Day 44 of Circuit breaker.
Is another rainy morning.
I am feeling lazy like Gudetama.
I just want to have the quickest and easy breakfast.
Meiji Plain crackers with oat to the rescue.
Eat it with two soft boil eggs and is a done deal !! Easy breezy and lazy breakkie.😁 P/S - This Gudetama disposable paper plate is so cute. Great for my lazy breakkie. Just throw away after that. No need to wash.😊 #jasmine_homecooked #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithst
