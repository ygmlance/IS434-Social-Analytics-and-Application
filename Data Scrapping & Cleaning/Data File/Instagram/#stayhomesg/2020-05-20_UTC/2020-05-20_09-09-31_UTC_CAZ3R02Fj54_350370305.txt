Weâ€™ve been finishing up our home renovations, and the amount of dust has been causing my allergies to act up - the ðŸ¤§ has been real. Allergies have been the no. 1 contributor to my eye bags. I always get asked if I didnâ€™t sleep enough or if I was sick, but itâ€™s just my allergies acting up and blocking my capillaries. Iâ€™m especially sensitive to flowers, pollen, grass, dust mites (and unfortunately dog and cat fur too). It seems Iâ€™ve escaped spring allergies after I left New Zealand, only to be hit with dust allergies here in Singapore. Most days itâ€™s manageable, but I always have a pack of #Clarityn handy just in case. Theyâ€™re non-drowsy and offers fast 24 hour relief. #feeltheclarity #sp
