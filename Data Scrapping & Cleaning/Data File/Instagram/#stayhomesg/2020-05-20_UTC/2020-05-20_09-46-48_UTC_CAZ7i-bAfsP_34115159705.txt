Otto Ristorante is known as one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. Otto’s extensive food menu includes a lot of ala carte choices, set meals and also an extensive wine list. Top highlights from Otto Ristorante are their Seared foie gras, Crispy “suckling pig” lacquered with acacia honey, and Linguine Boston lobster with spicy tomato gravy.
.
For the beef lovers, check out the Wagyu beef carpaccio with parmesan cheese salad. Want some pasta? Try the Spaghetti with sea urchin. It is unlike the usual traditional Italian pasta but you are definitely getting your sea urchin fix in that meal. Lastly, their collection of Italian wines that are sourced entirely from Italy will absolutely surprise you!
