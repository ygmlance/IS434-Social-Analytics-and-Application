🌹To make a people happy, add not to their riches, but take away their desires.🌹 That’s the reason why some people living simply are happier than those rich people living in luxury. Most importantly, we should always reflect on our life priorities at different stages of life. Today, I’m eating eggs sandwich in a cute way! 🤩 I recreated  a very popular Snoopy scene. So the bread went to Snoopy’s house, the hard boiled eggs went to Snoopy and Woodstock! Snoopy took the egg white and Woodstock took the egg yolk. It’s really difficult doing Woodstock because egg yolk are so soft to work with.🤣 I guess my Snoopy also eats too much during this CB which resulted in an abnormally big tummy! 🤪And because today is 520 (May 20th), love is all around~~~ ❤️❤️❤️ Fyi, May 20th is also known as a day for professing love because 520 sounds like “I love you” in Chinese. 😍So, I did a Cupid coffee stencil art on my Starbucks. 🥰Have a sweet 520 everyone! 🌹🌹🌹
