Want to dive deeper into the world of Japanese literature but don't know where to start? Join our JCC Book Club as we introduce and recommend translated Japanese titles that you can enjoy weekly while you stay at home! We have chosen titles that have resonated with many in Japanese in the hopes that they will resonate with you too. 
Today’s recommendation is “Night on the Galactic Railroad” by Kenji Miyazawa. 
This classic fantasy-fable-like novel tells a story about a boy who dreams of stars and galaxies. Major themes question “What is true happiness?” Miyazawa also creates many words that never get fully explained, forming a beautiful poetry-like story that continues to be loved by audiences from all generations.
