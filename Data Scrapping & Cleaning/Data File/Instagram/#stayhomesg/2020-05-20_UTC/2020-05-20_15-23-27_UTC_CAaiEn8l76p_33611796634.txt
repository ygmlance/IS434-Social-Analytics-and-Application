20/05 Samayal- For most south indians, there is no introduction needed for Rasam . As it plays an important role in south indian cuisine. Our amma says its good for digestion, cold and fever.  She also instructs us to drink it regularly.  Rasam is very comforting . We dont know anyone who doesn't like rasam ! We like our rasam peppery, sour and with a tinge of spiciness in it ! This is one of our power combination southindian dish ! Try it and you will have no regrets. .
