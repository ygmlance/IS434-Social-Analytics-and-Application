Good morning everyone ！

What’s the biggest problem when you makeup ?
For me , my biggest problem before was how to apply mascara NATURALLY 
They alway stick together 😭  But now , I have really fallen in love with O’iche Magic Mascara ❤️ Its easy to use and my eyelash never stick together again , and the eyelashes can be curled for longer time ~
You still can use the mascara even you got eyelash extension , it doesn’t affect the extension duration ! And its could be removed smoothly with warn water ~
