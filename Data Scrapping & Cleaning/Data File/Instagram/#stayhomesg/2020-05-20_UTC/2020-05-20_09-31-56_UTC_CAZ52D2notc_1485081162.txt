Stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs is a common dish in China.

It's a dish that I enjoyed during my project in Zhuhai and Beijing. In front of our apartment, there's a local restaurant selling this, and this dish is one of my favourite that I ordered mostly. 
A simple dish but delicious and really nice to have a bowl of rice with it.
