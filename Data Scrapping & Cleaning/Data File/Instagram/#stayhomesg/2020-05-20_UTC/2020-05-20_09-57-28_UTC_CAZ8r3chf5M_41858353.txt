⁣Mapo tofu. Quite a few ingredients in this but even if you don't make the full recipe, I really really urge you to try the Szechuan peppercorn mince I did in the beginning of the video. It's simply 2 parts dried chilli to 1 part Szechuan peppercorn(by weight), stir fry in oil for a couple of seconds for it to release its aromas, then transfer to a chopping board and finely chop it. It's like a crazy instant mala seasoning for all stir frys and even in sauces ⠀
