It is wonderful to just celebrate life, family, friends and love. Counting our blessings and the abundance that surrounds us despite coping with so much change in the last few months. Whipping out the good old charcoal steamboat is a once or twice a year affair, usually over the Lunar New Year. This time, we take it out to simply celebrate life itself. The gift of a close knitted family, seriously good friends, my supportive yoga family, vigour and above all, the blessings of an abundant table.
