This may not be a good economic timing to make drastic changes to our lives due to Covid 19. I think it is more so for those who have a very stable income and working in an unaffected industry or job. Then again, when is really a good time? Before Covid 19, we are all in our comfort zone. Life was as per routine and plans. Recently, I hear familiar brands letting go of employees & favorite hangouts preparing to close down in a month's time. It is saddening. The entrepreneurs seeing their hard work reaching to a halt of their aspirations. Making such decisions requires a big deal of courage & acceptance. Coming to terms to sudden income loss need the employees to embrace change and take a new step to unchartered waters.

I think everyone needs human spirit, courage to change and acquisition of new skills to move forward. It is okay to lose oneâ€™s footing momentarily, but not lose oneself. Get going, peeps. If there is anyone who needs to rub off some positivity, pm us. We want you to know you need not be lonely during this extraordinary times.
