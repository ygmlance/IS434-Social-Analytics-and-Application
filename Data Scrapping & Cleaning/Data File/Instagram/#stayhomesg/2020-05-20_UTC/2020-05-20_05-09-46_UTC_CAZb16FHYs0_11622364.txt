My education in Italian food continues to Vaccinara, or more commonly known as oxtail stew

A couple of things I observed, which wouldn’t surprise those who spent time in a professional Italian kitchen or a domestic environment possessing peripheral accompaniments for a traditional Italian table. To build up extra flavour one would utilise iberico fat and thick lardons of prosciutto, if, and when, available 
Love is translated by hand picking the bones and returning the separated meat to the sauce. Thank you @matteo.chef! Either that, or a tedious prep that you’d assign to an intern if you’re lucky to have any
