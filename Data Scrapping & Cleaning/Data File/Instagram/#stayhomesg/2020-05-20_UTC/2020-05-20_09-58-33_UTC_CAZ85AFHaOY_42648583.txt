My all-time favourite gonna to be the Saveur Pasta, taste so good even when delivered. You won't go wrong with Capellini in Truffle Oil. Though the only ingredient is Sakura Ebi but this is also the secret weapon that lifted up the overall taste to give abit of crunchy twist.⁣
⁣
For those who want to go meatless must try their Mushroom Alfredo Pasta, absolutely savory for such a simple dish. Just Parmesan Cheese and Mushroom yet so nice. ⁣
⁣
Sophia's Risotto is their signature dish from their bar, that's not to be missed. Cooked with a spice mixture that's taste like Otak yet not spicy. With Mackerel and Crabmeat chunks on top.⁣
⁣
