Fostering Ramadan Spirit Amidst Covid-19 - Analysis - Eurasia Review by Ustaz Ahmad Saiful @rijalhassan 
The article published on 19 May highlights the fact that even though the #covid19 #pandemic restricts certain religious and other communal practices (such as #iftar), this does not prevent #Muslims from celebrating the spirit of #Ramadan even under challenging circumstances. 
Despite challenges faced during #Ramadan, #Muslims embraced changes and adopted alternative ways of expressing care and unity as well as strengthening ties among people from different beliefs and races.

Notably the article posits that as the world is battling against #covid19, there are limitations for #Muslims in performing acts of worship such as praying in congregation as well as breaking fast at #mosques. Nevertheless, Ustaz Rijal mentions that #Muslims are celebrating #Ramadan in full spirit to ensure that it will not be less significant and still be meaningful. 
Some of these include: (i) Religious leaders have found ways to communicate through various online platforms during this crisis; (ii) Due to the closure of #mosques, the campaign in US and UK seeks to encourage #Muslim families to create a dedicated ‘mini’ prayer spaces that mimic #mosques at their homes instead, (iii) In #Singapore, #mosques produced online religious content to cater the #spiritual needs of local #muslim community. The #malaymuslim community leaders in #Singapore also partook in series of virtual #iftar with government leaders as well as other religious communities.
