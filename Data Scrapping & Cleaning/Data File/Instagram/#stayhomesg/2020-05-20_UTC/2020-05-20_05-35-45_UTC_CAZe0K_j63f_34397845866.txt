In the meantime, I made these cheesy oven baked mash potato and caulillini chicken pie for the little princess. She is a very fussy eater. At 15 months old, she is still very lazy to chew her food and rejects anything chunky. I got sian of feeding her porridge all the time, so it's ang moh jiak for today! 
Princess approved with a yum yum yum!
