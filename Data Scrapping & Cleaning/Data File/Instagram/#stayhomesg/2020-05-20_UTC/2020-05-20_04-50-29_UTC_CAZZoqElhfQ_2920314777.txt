Chillax with Vegan Pumpkin Coconut Ice Cream ...
I made some Eggless Kaya (Pumpkin Kaya) a week ago. One day, I started to think of ice cream and converted some of it into ice cream and nice.

Ingredients: Steamed pumpkin blend with coconut milk. Cooked the puree till slightly thicken. Sugar (optional). Freeze it.
