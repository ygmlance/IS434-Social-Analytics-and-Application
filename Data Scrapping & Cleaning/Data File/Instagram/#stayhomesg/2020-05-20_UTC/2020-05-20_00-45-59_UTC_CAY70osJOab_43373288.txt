There’s been much discussion about the need for food security and sustainability during these uncertain times, and growing a small urban farm in your own apartment can be a small start to address this. In this episode of #MadeByShentonistas, Calvin and Dylan from @one.kind.house take us through some vegetables that are easy for anybody to grow, and share with us a nifty little invention created by Dylan that can make your hydroponic garden dreams a reality—no matter how small your space.
One Kind Block, created by Dylan, is now available on Kickstarter at bit.ly/OneKindBlock.
