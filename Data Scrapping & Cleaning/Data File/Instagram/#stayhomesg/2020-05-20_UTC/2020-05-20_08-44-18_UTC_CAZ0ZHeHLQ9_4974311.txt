[18.05.20] Day 42 of #circuitbreaker:

We unboxed the #NintendoLabo today! 
The Labo consists of DIY kits that work with the Nintendo Switch. Kids build the different Toy-Con projects made out of cardboard with instructions provided in the kit. Each project comes with multiple ways to play on the Switch as well!

Thank you @mummybean, for sharing this cool and fun game for the kids that can keep them entertained for DAYS!
