Singapore’s Circuit Breaker has been extended and with all the Home Based Learning, TV, YouTube, IG/FB going on, I can feel that my eyes are getting drier and “heavier”. 😭

Lucky I got a secret weapon to my rescue (for my eyes to be exact 😶). Thanks to Rohto Eye Drops Cool!

Rohto Eye Drops  is a popular eye drop brand from Japan, super refreshing, cooling and moisturizing! Super Shiok feeling 🤗 After applying one drop each to my eyes, I can feel the instant “lift” to my super drained eyes... 😀

The shape and design of the bottle is pretty unique too, u can spot any contamination (if any) easily 👍🏻 Awesome right!!! .

Keen to try it out yourself? You will be glad to know that Shopee has 25% off throughout the month of May 😱 Must take care of our eyes ok?
