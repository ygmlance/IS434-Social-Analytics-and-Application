Asian Fusion with @shihlinsnacks 🥳
Tried to create a new recipe using the current snacks from Shihlin & I went with sushi! To be honest, I think it turned out better than I expected?! If y’all are keen, do try out the #ZhngItUpWithShihlin challenge too since we’re all #stayinghome & you might be walking away with a year’s supply of shihlin snacks!! 😋🙆🏼‍♀️❤️
