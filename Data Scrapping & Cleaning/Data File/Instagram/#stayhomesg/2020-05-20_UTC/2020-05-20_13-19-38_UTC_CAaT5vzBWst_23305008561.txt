20/31 - Indoor Outdoor
Prompt: Look back on the past few weeks and consider what has felt momentous for you.
Reaction: I think if anything, COVID-19 has shaken the world down to the roots. No one is unaffected by it and everyone is trying to cope in one way or another. For me, it would be to accept the fact that indoors will be my new outdoors. And to find the positives and creativity in these times.

For #circuitbreakermay, i've decided to take on an experiment in abstract imagery using the prompts from #theisolationjournals , to inspire me from their writing. During the #ecbm (extended circuit breaker measures) that will be in place in #singapore for the month of may.
