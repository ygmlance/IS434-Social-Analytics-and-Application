Here is a historic moment captured - me making a #filtercoffee for the first time in my life. I guess the #CircuitBreaker does have a silver lining of getting people to try their hand at new things 😆.
So the video shows me in my PJs diligently following the instructions @sulyntan had texted, using the items she had sent me the night before - an elegant cotton filter and the “Three Volcanoes” fine blend of coffee, both of which can be purchased from @bachacoffeeofficial at Orchard ION. The rest of my “equipment” were a hodgepodge of what I could dig out from the cupboards at home 😂. If I may say so, I think I did rather well as the malty flavours and nutty overtones of the “Three Volcanoes” seemed present in my cuppa.
Coincidentally, this fine blend containing Central American and Arabian beans, has been my favourite since my first visit to their beautiful space in Orchard ION. Subsequently, regardless of whatever else in their vast coffee menu I ordered, I have always still included a pot of the “Three Volcanoes”. #veronicaphuadrinks #veronicaphuaeats #bachacoffee #pourover #coffee #caffeine #burpproved #burppletastemaker #burpple #burpplesg #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #coffeelover #coffeetime #instacoffee #foodiesofinstagram #pourovercoffee #foodstagram #foodie #finedining #singapore #stayhomesg #coffeesg
