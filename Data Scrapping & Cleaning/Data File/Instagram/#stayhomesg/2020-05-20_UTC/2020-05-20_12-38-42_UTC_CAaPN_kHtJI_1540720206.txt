{{⛰CAPPADOCIA}} Did you know that ancient volcanic eruptions, with the help of wind and water, leaves behind a fairytale landscape such as this 👆🏻? What an example of what seems like a destructive force of nature - volcanic eruptions, becoming a beautiful one! Looks like a scene out of Star Wars? 😉

Yet, human hands performed marvellous works here too. Early Christians who were fleeing from Romans took refuge here, turning these rock formations into cave houses and chapels. 
As we rode on the horses through this heart-captivating landscape, I couldn’t help but think of the haunting history and how it must have felt dwelling and seeking refuge during those times?

Do you feel ‘caged up’? Where do you stand on ‘creating my own life’ and ‘things just happen to me’? For me, each time I take in such beauty of natural landscapes, I am in awe of a Creator. While He first created, I know that He has given me gifts to build on (resulting in ‘my creations’), whether or not it is at a beautiful or haunting place, or a beautifully haunting place. - R 🐴🌾 #BRINGINGMORITOPLACES #tslbojio
