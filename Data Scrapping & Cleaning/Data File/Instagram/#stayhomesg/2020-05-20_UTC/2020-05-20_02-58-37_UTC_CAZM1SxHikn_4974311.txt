[17.05.20] Day 41 of #circuitbreaker:

Sunday night spent with @artpeacesg working on #Totoro! 
Had problems catching up due to technical glitches on Zoom. Watched My Neighbour Totoro on @netflixsg the next day, so that I can do another piece on my own. ☺️ #sgunited #stayhomeforsg #stayhome #stayhomesg #istayathome #sgparents #sgmoms #nagomiart #softpastels #artpeacesg
