Can you spot the 4 tiny butterflies perching on the tiny wildflowers? 
With no one trimming these patches of green space, they're gathering strength!
I am very grateful for the well planned landscapes of greenery in my estate and treasure every green shrub I run into!
It's a wildflowers kind of wednesday for me.ðŸ™‚
