#CircuitBreaker Day44⠀
⠀
God Fire, $15.52 from 𝐈𝐤𝐤𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐡𝐚 𝐇𝐚𝐤𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐑𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧 ⠀
⠀
It was raining cats & dogs this morning and we decided to have something warm and soupy for lunch, so we googled around & 💬 came across one of our fav ramen brand, where you can place your order online, complete your payment and drop by their restaurant for free pick-up. Yayyy! 🎉🎉⠀
⠀
Level 2 God Fire is definitely fiery🔥, not for the faint hearted! If you enjoy spicy like we do, the spicy kick on the broth is so shiok, it has a balance of spiciness and the natural flavour of original pork broth! Perfect for all, you can customise your noodle texture, spicy level and saltiness based on your preferences. It was definitely one of the best food we ever had during this CB period and it brighten up our mood and satisfy our tummy! *tummy rubs* ⠀
