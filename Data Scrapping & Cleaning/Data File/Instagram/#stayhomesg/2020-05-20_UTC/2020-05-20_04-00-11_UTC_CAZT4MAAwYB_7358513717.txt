EASY LENTIL STEW WITH MASH POTATOES by @veganbowlsrecipes 
Such a perfect combination for a rainy day. Below is my adaptation of the recipe. Iâ€™d substituted with curry ingredients because I crave for curry whenever it rains.
[Ingredients]
/Lentil Stew/
-1 cup dry lentils
-1 tbsp cooking oil
-1 onion
-1 carrot
-1 tomato
-1 cup diced long beans
-3 cups water
-1 tbsp curry powder
-1 tsp garam masala
-1 tbsp soy sauce
-1 tsp salt
-1/4 cup coconut milk (final step)
-1 tsp cornstarch* (final step to thicken)
/Mashed Potatoes/
-6-8 small potatoes (each cut in 6 pieces)
-1/4 cup coconut milk
-1/2 tsp salt
-A dash of freshly ground black pepper
[Steps]
-Rinse lentils and soak with water while you prepare the rest of the ingredients
-Chop onion, tomato, carrot, and long beans
-Wash and drain lentils
-Heat pan on medium heat with cooking oil. Brown onion with curry powder and garam masala. Add vegetables and lentils. Stir for a few mins and add water. Bring to boil and simmer on low heat for 30 mins. Stir every 10 mins to check water level and lentils doneness. Add more hot water if lentils need to be cooked longer
-Meanwhile, bring another pot of water to boil. Wash, peel, and chop potatoes. Boil potatoes for 20-30 mins. Check for doneness with a fork. Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Add coconut milk, salt and pepper. Mash potatoes with a masher or fork
-Check on lentil. Add coconut milk and simmer for 2 mins. In a small bowl, mix 2 tbsp water to cornstarch. Add in mixture to thicken the gravy. Turn off the heat. Season with more salt and pepper to taste
-Serve gravy with mashed potatoes and your favorite bread
