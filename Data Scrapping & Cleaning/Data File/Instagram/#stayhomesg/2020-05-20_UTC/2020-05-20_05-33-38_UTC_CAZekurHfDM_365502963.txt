😋 I love beancurd skin and when I heard about this Fupi Beancurd Skin Crisps, I am so excited to try it out! This Vegan-friendly snack taste delicious and I especially love the Mala flavor. However, I personally feel that they could give abit more beancurd skin crisps in each packet as  I managed to finish it fairly quickly. Nevertheless, really cute and creative packaging!
