Garlic prawn pasta, spiked with chilli.

One of my favourite dishes to cook.. because it’s simple and quick to make, and it tastes heavenly!

I use fresh tiger prawns 🦐, seared on high-heat in salted butter & olive oil. It’s tossed in loads of crispy garlic, basil leaves, and a bit of chilli for a zing. Finish off with a sprinkle of seasalt and a healthy crack of black pepper!

I served it with a cold fresh salad of vine-ripened cherry tomatoes🍅, boccocini and basil leaves. It’s pretty much the only salad I’ll willingly eat 😉
