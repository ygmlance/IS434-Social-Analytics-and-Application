19/05 Samayal - soorakkai ( bottlegourd) kootu. Tahu sambal and pumpkin pirratal.  At tamilantabao,  we believe that a dish's consistency is very important.  Certain dishes need to be of light , and runny consistency,  whereas others need to be thick and  viscous . We like it thick üòè ! we make sure that we try to make the dish as close to how it is made traditionally, and nothing fancy. Simplicity is the beauty of south indian meals. .
