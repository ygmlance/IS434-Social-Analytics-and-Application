👩🏻‍🍳Process: recipes from @hotthaikitchen. Most of the effort went into pounding to get that tasty green chilli paste. Other than that, pretty simple mixing of sauces and multiple minor adjustments to achieve a perfect flavour balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy
.
😋Taste: 9/10. Don’t be fooled by the lack of colour as this meal was packed full of flavours and the family agreed it was a successful #thaimeal. We also enjoyed the addition of oyster mushrooms to the curry that was chewy and soaked up the flavours, and peas (as an alternative to Thai pea eggplants) that provided a texture balance

P.S. We also made a gin - kaffir lime - matcha - tonic water cocktail which was divineee
