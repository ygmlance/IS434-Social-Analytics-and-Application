themed playmats ftw! this has got to be my most successful diy for the girls! a year on and theyre still loving it and every. single. time. they bring it out, it feels brand new! ðŸ¤—

on our farm, we have a vege patch, a pond, a muddy puddle, lots of hay, and a grassy field for munching and crunching!
Â°
i threw in a couple of our farm animals and also specially included a feeding set, a grooming kit and a horse care set all from #schleich. the girls almost immediately immersed themselves in their roles! #swipeformore
Â°
simply DM if you'd like to purchase! ðŸ¥°
