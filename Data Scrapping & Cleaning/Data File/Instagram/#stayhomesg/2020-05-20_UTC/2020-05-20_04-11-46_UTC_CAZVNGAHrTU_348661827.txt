A lot have been asking what we use at home for their art demo programs. To be honest, I just literally searched “acrylic painting for beginners” or “oil pastels for beginners” on YouTube. We chanced upon ART ARENA channel @artarena1 for demos who makes blending and creating beautiful art pieces so easy for kids to follow. There is so much free content online that these artists share. Kids will chose what subject they want to paint and for my kids it’s usually nature (we’ve been spending a ton of time outdoors biking - obviously in our neighbourhood away from the crowds 🙄 so they are obsessed with nature). For me, working on their fine motors skills such as working with scissors, playdoh, pizza doh or drawing/painting is so much more important that doing worksheets. Working on using their smaller muscles in their wrist and fingers helps with coordination which leads to independence such as being able to tie their shoe laces, button their own shirts, open a can/bottle or feed themselves at dinner etc. Plus...I just bought myself a couple of hours of kid free time 😬. Most importantly for them esp during this stressful and crazy times is that they can express their feelings through art when they can’t do it with words. My kids are definitely affected by the #covid19 #lockdown #circuitbreakersg
