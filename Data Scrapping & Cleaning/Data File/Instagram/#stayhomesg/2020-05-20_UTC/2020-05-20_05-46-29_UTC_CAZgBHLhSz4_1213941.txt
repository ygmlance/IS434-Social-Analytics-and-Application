[BAKE KITS]

I would never have thought I would be eating brownies that I baked myself until the folks at @bakerisingapore sent me their Walnut Fudgy Brownie Baking Kit (S$35). Most of the ingredients are provided in the kit except for the 7 medium eggs. And of course, you would need an oven at home to bake. So you don't have to worry that flour is sold out at the supermarkets because almost everyone else in your hood is also baking.

Preparation time takes approximately 30 minutes while it takes 40 minutes to bake. You get quite a good arm workout whisking the chocolate and butter, or the eggs with the sugar and salt and baking powder. A recipe card with easy-to-follow instructions is provided.

And I got 2 trays of brownies which turned out to be surprisingly good. Throw in a scoop of homemade ice cream that I got from @apiary.sg and that made it perfect for the warm and humid afternoons. Gave the other tray to our neighbour @eatmekevin to share the sinful treat.

Damien and Dawn, the founders of Bakeri launched their online store earlier this month to cater to online shopping demand. Bakeri has been a wholesaler of artisanal bakes for a decade. The online bakery stocks handmade bread loaves, pastries, family packs, cakes and baking kits in pack sizes suitable for families. If you are a first-time baker like me, you can get these kits just to have some fun on your own or with family members.

The range of baking kits include lemon chia seed pound cake, chocolate fudgy brownie, earl grey chocolate cookies, cheese and herbs bread and the most recent addition is the “Little Bear Muffin” baking kit, a collaboration with @littlemissbento. .
