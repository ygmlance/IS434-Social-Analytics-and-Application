Throwback to Mom's claypot rice.
This pandemic situation has called for even more home cooked food by mom.
Much as there are lotsa options out there, mom prefers to get down to cooking.
Blessings that my mom is a good cook.
Her rendition of claypot rice.
More ingredients, more colorful. Though there may be a lack of charcoal aroma, but it comes with an additional scent of home cook food.
Have you been cooking or ordering delivery more?
