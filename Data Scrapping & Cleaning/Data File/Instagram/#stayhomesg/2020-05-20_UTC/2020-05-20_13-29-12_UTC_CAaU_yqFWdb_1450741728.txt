While going above and beyond can be loving ,it is often at the cost of ourselves .Don’t get me wrong there are times when someone is in real need of support .But when we are continuously going to the moon and back,we are actually robbing them of the chance to do their own work.We are left empty and resentful that we have nothing for ourselves.Always protect your energy !⁣⁣
