SASHIMI DELIVERY?!
One of my biggest cravings during Circuit Breaker is definitely fresh sashimi, which is usually eaten when you dine-in at the restaurant itself, which has proven to be impossible even when CB is lifted on 1 Jun! But One Sushi is now offering FREE delivery with 15% OFF limited Sengkang, Yishun and Punggol for optimal freshness! Think:
.
