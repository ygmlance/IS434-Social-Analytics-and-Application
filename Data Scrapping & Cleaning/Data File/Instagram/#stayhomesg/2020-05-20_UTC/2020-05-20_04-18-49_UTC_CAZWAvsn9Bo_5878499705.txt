Waddaaapppp! How’s everyone feline this Wonderful Wednesday? I hope all’s well! I have more free time these days thanks to CB & I’ve been occupying myself with various activities!

Like, tormenting the floof. 🤣 She’s very nice to squish. She’s pretty much resigned herself to her fate of getting squished daily by her hooman.

Of course, it’s only when she gets da treats. No treats, no squish. 
Nah I kid. She’s the best catto so she pretty much lets me have my way all the time. 🤣 
Have you been spending time with your floofs too? Of course, it doesn’t have to be a floof. 
It’s nice to take this time to just spend time with your pets or learn something! Cook that dish! Bake that cake! Learn that dance! Sing that song! Now’s the perfect time! 🤣 
Share with me what you’ve been doing during this CB! I would love to know.

Meanwhile, stay strong, stay safe & stay healthy everybody! 💪🏻💪🏻
