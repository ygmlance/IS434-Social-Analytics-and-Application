💯If it doesn’t challenge you, it doesn’t change you.💫

⬇️Now that I can’t spin🚴‍♀️, I’ve gotten into a 🆕️ routine that helps me stay active and fit💪.
.
Before Circuit Breaker – Spin & Run
🆚️
NOW – HIIT, Walk, Run & ABS workout!
.
Changes in life’s routine↪ are inevitable, and sometimes challenging. (Before CB) I always find excuses⛔ to skip HIIT/ GRIT cardio because I hate feeling 😪 sore after the workout. When I just started doing GRIT Cardio it was very tough😭, BUT instinctively we know that what doesn't change us doesn't improve us💪
.
D44. I’m leaner compared to D1.
.
I’m trying to make the most of what I have and hope to come out of circuit breaker happy and fitter!🥰
