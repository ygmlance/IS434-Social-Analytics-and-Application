This Hari Raya Puasa, our driver- and delivery-partners will be working hard to get your favourite treats and celebration meals right to you. Want to show your appreciation? Swipe through for some ideas on how you can show your GrabtitudeðŸ’š even with contactless delivery.

And make sure to tag us and use the #GrabtitudeðŸ’š hashtag, so that our other driver- and delivery-partners get to see them too! Link in bio.
