Breaking Circuit D35...
Recently I was promoted to Human Shredder. Vertical promotion, no pay raise. The pile was growing and growing and growing. Boss thought I was slacking and started to help. Rip, pull,  tear....Good exercise. Bulk my 💪🏼. Hulk feel. Cleaning mind and office. Bye bye, dust, pest & germs. 13 kg for recycling. € 1.95 earned for the Fanfare band😉. Just lucky I was not banned to the extremely sunny & sweaty 🅿️...
