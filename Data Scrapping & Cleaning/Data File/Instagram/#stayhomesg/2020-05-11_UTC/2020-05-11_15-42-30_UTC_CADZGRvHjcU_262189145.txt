Took out my Long Long never use ‘happy call pan’ to cook glutinous rice. 3x3/4 cup soaked glutinous rice , stir fry shallots , Chinese sausage , dry shrimps, dried scallops , mushrooms , peanuts in the pan, then add rice and sauce (sesame oil, dark soya sauce , light soya sauce , sugar, oyster sauce ) , cost till the rice are evenly covered , add 21/2 cups water (use the same cup as the one for rice ). Cover lid. Shift pan around to avid burnt rice. About 20-30 min and fragrant rice is ready. Can see my IGTV (video dove by @deztan on the process. ==========================
