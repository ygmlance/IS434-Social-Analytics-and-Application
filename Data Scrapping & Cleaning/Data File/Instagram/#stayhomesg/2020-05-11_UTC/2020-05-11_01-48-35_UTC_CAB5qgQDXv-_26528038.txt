Have you guys tried the at home salon yet? Usually involves two kids pulling my hair and smashing brushes in my eyes. The experience is painful and I come out looking worse than I arrived but I can pay in kisses so I’ll give it a 10/10. .

Have you guys tried any at home hair fixes? How’d they go? I’m still trying to convince my husband and son that I could cut their hair but they don’t believe me. Probably best. I’d want to give them a fade and a Nike swoosh or something and since I don’t know how to do either it would probably end up with scrubby bald patches. But who’s going to see anyway?! It’d make a great story and I do love a good story. 😅😂😇

Ps I know I have a tail sticking out of my head. Framing wasn’t exact on this one. Always wanted to be a mermaid though. 🧜🏻‍♀️
