Lunch was interesting for me - it was a last minute decision to cook porridge after the lovely downpour. And of course, how can we have this without youtiao! Then I remember commenting on someoneâ€™s IG post (I have short term memory whose IG account it was. ðŸ˜…please let me know if itâ€™s you so I can tag you) using frozen prata as substitute so I decided to try it out despite hating to deep fry. And tada! It sure looks like it in miniature version! ðŸ˜‚ itâ€™s workable except it doesnâ€™t have a chewy texture nor a familiar taste. The crisp pairs well with the porridge though. ðŸ˜‰
