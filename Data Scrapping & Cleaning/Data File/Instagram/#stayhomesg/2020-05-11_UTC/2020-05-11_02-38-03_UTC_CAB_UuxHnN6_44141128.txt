CCB Day 35/55- The day I decided to... TRIM MY OWN HAIR!! 💇🏻‍♀️ Wasn’t a whole chunk thou, probably snipped off about an inch or so?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
When my hair reaches certain length, a part at the back tends to get tangled EVERY SINGLE TIME & I can’t stand it anymore so... Anw I figured if I screwed up, there is 1 month for me to grow it back 🤣🤣🤣

And I’m proud to say I’m really satisfied with the end results 🤣

Now I’ve just got to convince @kohthyeleng to let me trim his hair hahaha 💇🏻‍♂️🤭
