♡ Mama's snacks ♡
.
Hey you, Sichuan Mala and Hotpot Tomato fans, I have something to introduce you! .
.
If you feel troublesome of preparing a pot of mala or hotpot, why not trying out these @fupi.co in Hotpot Tomato and Sichuan Mala flavors. It’s something light but yet, I’m sure this will definitely satisfy your craving.
.
Did you know @fupi.co is the Singapore's first beancurd skin snack that made all positivity, zero added preservatives and vegan friendly crisps? .
.
This Si Chuan Mala teases your taste buds with a fiery, tenacious spice. A blend of fragrant herbs and spices cleverly numbs and excites the palette. The addictive level definitely hit 100%! .
.
Hotpot Tomato is something I looking forward. It takes you back to your favourite hotpot soup base. You can actually taste the aromatic taste of tomato soup at the first bite. The combination of sweet, sour and savoury is legit lehhh!
.
fǔpí is now available at all 7-ELEVEN stores islandwide. You can just grab it from your nearest 7-ELEVEN. Ohh, not feel like going out? Fred not, you can grab it from @lazada_sg or @shopee_sg (link in @fupi.co bio) 
Remember to follow their social media if you don’t wanna miss out any of their promotion.  Grab some and enjoy it during this #CB period! .
