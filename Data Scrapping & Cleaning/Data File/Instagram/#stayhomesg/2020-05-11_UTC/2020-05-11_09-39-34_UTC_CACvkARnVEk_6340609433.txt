𝟕𝟓 𝐀𝐡 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐭 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐩⠀
⠀
Cravings for some delicious and tasty glutinous rice balls? We are so delightful to hear that our favourite 𝟕𝟓 𝐀𝐡 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐭 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐩 is still open for business as usual. Feeling so good to be able to enjoy some of our local hawker food that we missed badly. ⠀
⠀
We adore their rich, fragrant and fine sesame fillings Ah Ballings wrapped with their soft and QQ skin that’s so yummy, very different from those we had elsewhere. Taste even more shiok in their flavourful peanut soup with generous portion of soft peanuts 🥜 in it. We did a few takeaway for our family and they all enjoyed it, saying it’s very traditional and it’s not too sweet for their liking! 👍🏻 So goood! ⠀
⠀
It’s been passed down to their third generation and we hope they will continue their 73 years of tradition making handmade glutinous rice balls and peanut soup! ⠀
