Homemade Hokkaido Wagyu Beef Burger | Tried our luck to grab some less boring food items  at @donkisg last night and found this TREASURE!! 🏅$10 ONLY for 2 very juicy and delicious Wagyu beef patty! Got restaurant standard one la this patty. Its marinated with some teriyaki sort of sauce and the Mister love it alot! I was hoping to get something more ang moh la but still, 10 bucks is sibei good steal. Btw I only spent like $13.70 for a brekkie for 2! ❤️ Our bellies are satisfied! 🤪🤪🤪
