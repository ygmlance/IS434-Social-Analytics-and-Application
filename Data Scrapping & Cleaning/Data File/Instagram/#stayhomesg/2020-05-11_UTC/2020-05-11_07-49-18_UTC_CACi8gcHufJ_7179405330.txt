this one’s for all the frontliners and those working behind the scenes during this coronavirus outbreak!! 🥳 whether you’re doing your part by working from home, taking care of patients or staying inside... keep fighting 💪🏼😤 life is so different now & we have no idea when this will all end, but i hope all of you are doing okay 🥺 or at least getting by
.
Lord, today i pray for everyone who has been affected by the coronavirus and its effects— give them the strength to continue fighting and may you guide them to find the light in the midst of this bleak situation. i also pray that there will be a vaccine soon 🙏🏼 Amen!
