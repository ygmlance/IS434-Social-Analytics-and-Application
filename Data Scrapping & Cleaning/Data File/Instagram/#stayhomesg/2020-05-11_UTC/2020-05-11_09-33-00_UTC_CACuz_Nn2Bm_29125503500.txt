Another one for Historical Film Night: Jackie Chan's "Thunderbolt". Hong Kong's "Fast & Furious", if you will.

DVD just arrived in the mail today. Not watched it since it was released in 1995. Didn't know or care too much about cars back then, so will now be watching it with a new appreciation. ðŸ˜Ž
