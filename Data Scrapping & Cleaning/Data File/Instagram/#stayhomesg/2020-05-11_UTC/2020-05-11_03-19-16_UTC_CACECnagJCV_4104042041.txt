(Follow for more tips!) Drawing Electric  Field Lines - 1: Always remember to draw the field lines emerging PERPENDICULARLY from the surface. (Even if your drawing isnâ€™t great, like mine, draw that little box to show your intention was to make it perpendicular) 2: arrows point from + to -. (Follow the +ve test charge). 3: Earthed/grounded surfaces are induced with a Negative charge in the presence of a Positive charge. (Electrons flow from Earth into the plate).
