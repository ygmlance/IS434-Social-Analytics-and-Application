<THIS WEEK ON #NGOESLIVE!>
In order to provide a more interactive, informative and entertaining #StayAtHome programmes, we've reshuffled our line up this week! Leading up June 1, we will change our programme line-up and content every week with comedy sketches, interviews, live music and craft sessions, etc all on the menu, so stay tuned to our updates via our social media platforms!

Join us on IG Live tonight for Melody Monday where our host @fortykilos will be sharing about childhood memories! It's time for some reminiscence and nostalgia tonight!
