Today (11-May-2020), while cleaning our home, I discovered a collection of bookmarks (that have kept for years) and I thought that one of them, consisting an advice by #ProphetMuhammad, is suitable for our P1 son who has stayed at home for over a month, missing his grandmother, friends and teachers. He still has a lot to learn about values and virtues (and I am also re-learning together with him), including patience when trying to teach #abacus to his little sister. We also learned about the #IslamicWorld from a book entitled "Great Lives" of #Disney Children's Encyclopedia. Almost everyday, #secondhandsmoke enters our home (I have done my best to minimize it by shutting almost all windows but our home will become stuffy) or I see at least someone who removes his mask to smoke next to our HDB block (#howdareyou! of course, I would quickly shut our windows, though sometimes it is too late, but better late than never). Once, someone who helped me to get a non-smoking room in the Middle East asked me what I would do when I encounter smokers, besides avoiding them (sometimes, I could not). At that time, I was thankful that we could get a non-smoking room and replied that I would quietly pray for him/her to #quitsmoking for him/herself, family and others. That person remarked that often it was too late. May this extraordinary #Ramadan2020 bring the awareness, blessings, peace and health for the entire humanity. #RamadanMubarak  #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #stayhome #stayhomestaysafe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD4Bed8F9LI
