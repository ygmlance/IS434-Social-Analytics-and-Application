Inspired by the coffee art activity done by @lyttlespace , I began my own cafe latte painting exploration! I love the idea of using real coffee to paint! Someone asked me, why use coffee powder when it looks like brown poster colour/watercolour paint?
Simply because art is not just about techniques, it's the whole sensory experience and context of your concept. I love to do cafe art, but let's face it, we don't have the equipment and skills to try that foam art. So here's my version of fun foam art for our playful exploration! The aromatic smell fills the house and soothes the coffee lovers too. If you love coffee, this is for you and your kid who can't drink kopi yet, where art allows imagination to fly. ENJOY! Do tag me if you do this!
