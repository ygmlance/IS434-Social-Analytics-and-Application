If you are geeky about cacao like us, this new set of two Semai 72% dark chocolate limited release bars will pique your interest. Fermented in wine barrels for different number of days, these two batches of cacao served as an experiment to explore how fermentation length affect flavour development.
The verdict: With the exact same roast profile and further processing methods, we found that Lot.124 which was fermented for 6 days created an elegant floral, fruity chocolate with a slow melt and mid-heavy mouthfeel, while Lot.125 which was fermented for 14 days resulted in a chocolate with gentle wood tannins and grape-like aroma that reminds one of a delicious red wine.
This set of chocolate was made using an experimental batch of cacao hence it's available only as an ultra micro-batch! Stocks are now available on our webstore.
