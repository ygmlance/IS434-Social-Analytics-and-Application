3 FUN FACTS?!
1Ô∏è‚É£ Do you know that I love matcha so much that my walls at home are as green as matcha. Don‚Äôt worry about me licking my walls haha.
.
2Ô∏è‚É£ I‚Äôm such an introvert that I had been staying at home all day during Circuit Breaker. Ok, I was only out ONCE because I needed a haircut, and don‚Äôt judge me because I really did cut my hair one week before this photo was taken!
.
3Ô∏è‚É£ You can use PayLah! all your everyday needs? From KFC to 7-11 (hint: to get some bubble tea fix), to transport such as ezlink, Comfort, CityCab and Gojek and cashless payment by scanning NETS QR codes!
