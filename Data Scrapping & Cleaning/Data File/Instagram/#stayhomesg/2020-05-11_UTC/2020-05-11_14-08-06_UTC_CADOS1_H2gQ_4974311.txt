[10.05.20] Day 34 of #circuitbreaker:

We don’t make a big deal out of the occasion usually, so celebrations in the name of Mother’s Day this year weren’t too different from the past years. I have a legitimate reason not to do anything and get to choose whatever I want for dinner and desserts. Actually..come to think of it, it sounds like any other day since I do get my way if I want to. 😄 
I didn’t have hopes of getting any cards or gifts since school’s closed - no teachers to remind the kids to do something for their mothers. My kids actually had the face to tell me, “tomorrow is Mother’s Day??” after watching some advertisement on TV. I told them those advertisement were already in their faces for DAYS. Oh wells, so the cards were made on the day itself. 没有诚意，但还算有点心意. (I was horrified that the cub used so many of the art block papers though…cos Popular still cannot reopen leh!) #sgunited #stayhomeforsg #stayhome #stayhomesg #istayathome #sgparents #sgmoms #sgkids
