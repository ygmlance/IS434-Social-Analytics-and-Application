⁣Pad krapow moo- one of the easiest and tastiest Thai stir frys⠀
⠀
The paste is simply garlic and red chilli pounded together, and the sauce is Thai fish sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, water and oyster sauce(omit this if you want it MSG free). Also used a bit of kaffir lime leaf which worked really well⠀

Finished with fresh basil from my moms garden, and interestingly enough, @theskinnybib says: "If you coarsely tear it, it usually smells more Thai". I don't fully understand it...but it works 👌🏻
