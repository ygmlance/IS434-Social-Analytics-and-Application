[ 11 May 2020 // Day 35 of Circuit Breaker ] Just a nerdy happy me and how I look like every single day at home now 🤓✌🏼. No makeup, except for the moments when I need to work from home. Dressing up and applying makeup (or even contact lens!) feels like a distant memory but honestly, it’s not something tt I truly miss 🤭. I think I could get use to this CCB lifestyle- casual comfortable and basic. 😁💁🏻‍♀️
