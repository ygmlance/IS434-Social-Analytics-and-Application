Happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers out there! 💝 Thank you for all the sacrifices - juggling work and caring for us, being our PT tutor when we face difficulties in schoolwork, listening to our rants, cooking and ensuring we are well-fed, the list goes on. This Mother’s Day, we get to hear from @_yuanlin how it has been for her! 😊⁣⁣

“As the eldest child of the family, my mother has always been my source of inspiration and a person I looked up to since young. Loving, caring and supportive, she has always been looking out for my needs. She often works till late at night every day, with little to no time for herself, just so that we can live comfortably as a family.⁣⁣

This mothers’ day, my sister and I decided to bake chocolate lava cakes, one of her favourite desserts. To our surprise as novice bakers, she really enjoyed it and couldn’t stop smiling with every bite she took. Witnessing mom eating so heartily was such a rare sight which warmed my heart. It hit me that every single day with her is a blessing worth celebrating, and I should never take the hardships she has gone through as a mother for granted.”⁣⁣

Especially during this circuit breaker where most of us are spending all our time at home with our family members, let us count it as a blessing instead — to be safe under a roof with our loved ones. Every day with our mothers and loved ones is worth giving thanks for and we can simply express them with small acts of love and filiality. ⁣⁣

Mommas, we might be naughty at times but we love and appreciate you a lot! Have a blessed Mother’s Day!! 🌻😜
