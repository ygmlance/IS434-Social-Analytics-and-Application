This is me, my personal review. I had a break out on my forehead just awhile back. The scars were pretty deep and stubborn. I apply my usual Vit C serum but it didn't fade much. This comparison pic shows that just after 3 usage of bubble masks, the pimple scars did fade off quite significantly. Not totally gone but it does its job quite well. I know my untrimmed brows & gray hairs are gross but you know the pic is unfiltered.
Chat me up if you are looking to fade some scars too. A fuss-free home treatment solution ðŸ˜Š
