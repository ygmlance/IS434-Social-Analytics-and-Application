CB Day 35 of 56. Another soup recipe attempted. This round, it’s Creamy Carrot Soup carrot 🥕. Looks similar to the previous post on pumpkin soup isn’t it? ( which is why I have to add the two carrots in the pic) . 
Even the recipe is similar. Literally a case of 换汤不换药 😂😛 #CBDay35 #circuitbreaker  #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeandcook #homecooked #homecookedsoup  #homecookedmeal #creamsoup #carrotsoup #creamycarrotsoup #differentDishDaily #shotoniphone  #whatsforlunch
