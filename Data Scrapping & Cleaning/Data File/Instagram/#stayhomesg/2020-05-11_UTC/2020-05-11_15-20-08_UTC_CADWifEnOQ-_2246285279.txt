Thank you everyone who have supported ❤️ The proceeds (from Dec 2019 to Apr 2020) have been donated to Causes for Animals who urgently needs help to save puppies

Due to the recent bad weather, some of the street dogs were drenched in rain, living without any shelter. Apparently one of the street dogs had given birth and her puppies are currently seeking medical aids. 3 have already passed away from hypothermia and babesia in spite of efforts to help them

Causes for Animals need your help to continue to offer medical aid to the other puppies so they have a fighting chance at life. Help keep these puppies alive from just $10
