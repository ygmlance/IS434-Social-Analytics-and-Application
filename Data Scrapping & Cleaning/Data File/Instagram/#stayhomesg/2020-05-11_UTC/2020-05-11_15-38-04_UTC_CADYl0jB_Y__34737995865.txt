Finally set up a public IG account to document what I eat and like. 
I thought long and hard about what should I post as my first post and decided to post about these smashed avocado & brownies from @thebackyardbakers because I managed to get my hands on them today! 
I really like their smashed avocado, especially their mala smoked salmon. They are so generous with the avocado, which is of the right ripeness & creaminess. As for their brownies, itâ€™s one of the best; if not the best in SG!
