This is my 'default' dishes, if I do not have anything else, just cook this Indomie Instant noodle. Indomie Goreng.

This pack of Instant noodle was always in my luggage when I travelled during my IT Consultant Job :)
It's a 'safe' food if I cannot adjust with other country food, just buy egg or any other things, mix with it and become comfort food.
Especially during supper or breakfast, easy and fast and make my stomach happy :) And for me this 'Indomie Goreng' is the best Instant Noodle.

During my office time, that we can eat in the office. One in the morning, I had this Indomie for breakfast. The problem is this instant noodle aroma is very strong.
Suddenly my boss come out, "Who eat Indomie in the office" 
The secretary knew I was eating and she try to message me. I was scared. "oh nooooo...... " 
But my boss said, I want one, can next time buy two plate.
The secretary was happy, from that moment, she also can eat that instant noodle in the office :) Because we afraid the aroma very strong.
