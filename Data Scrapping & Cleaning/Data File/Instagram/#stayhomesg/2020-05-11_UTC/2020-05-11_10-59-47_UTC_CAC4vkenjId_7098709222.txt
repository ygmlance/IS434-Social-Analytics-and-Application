Tonightâ€™s dinner for hubs and I are leftover pohpiah and kueh pie tee - a diy lunch set I ordered for my mum and broâ€™s family yesterday, which they couldnâ€™t finish at all. ðŸ˜… so waste not! A quick pick up of the leftover and here is my dinner! ðŸ˜‹ the kids will have kalbi marinated chicken with short grain rice for dinner.  Happy meal!
