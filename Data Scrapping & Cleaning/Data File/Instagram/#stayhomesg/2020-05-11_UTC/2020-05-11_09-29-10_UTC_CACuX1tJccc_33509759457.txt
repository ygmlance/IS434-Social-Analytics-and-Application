Upskilling is a circuitbreaker buzzword, but there's more to it than upping your Excel game. Singapore's arts college @lasallesingapore is now offering its short courses for adults online via Zoom – covering everything from drawing and watercoloring to fashion portraiture and UX design. Classes range from 4-14 sessions and mostly take place after business hours.

What fun class do you want to take right now?
