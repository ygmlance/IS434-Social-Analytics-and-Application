Are you a spicy or non spicy eater ?
.
As I age, I find that my tummy no longer takes spice as well. Plus it's much easier leaving out the spice to cater to the kids. ðŸ˜… My hb still loved his spice though.
.
Today's lunch is ichiran ramen, using store bought rolled charsiew.
.
Separately cooked broth and mee sua for the kids as I find the ramen mix too oily and salty for them.
