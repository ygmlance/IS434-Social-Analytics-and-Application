Day ??? of Circuit Breaker: I've really lost count. It's been very tough trying to juggle work, Zoom meetings and motherly duties. Today, I had to attend an important zoom meeting where I had to do a presentation, help my colleague @ephraim.teng with his presentation, supervise my toddler's writing practice AND carry my baby (for a few minutes) almost all the same time ðŸ¤ª
