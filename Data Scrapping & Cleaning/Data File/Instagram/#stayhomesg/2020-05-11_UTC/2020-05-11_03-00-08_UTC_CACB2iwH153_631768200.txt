Day 35 of Circuit breaker. Is s gloomy raining morning but that doesn't means that I have to be gloomy too.😁
Using Gardenia 100% wholemeal Extra Soft & Fine bread , I created a cheerful omelette flower sandwiches with the left over crust that i had cut out. Waste not. Just roll it up to make into little snails and you can either colour with edible markers or fruity jam.
Have fun !
P/s - see next post on how to make the snails.
