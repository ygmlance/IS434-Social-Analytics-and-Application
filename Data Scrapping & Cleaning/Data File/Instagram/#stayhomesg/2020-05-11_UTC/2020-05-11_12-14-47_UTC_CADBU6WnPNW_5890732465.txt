Dear Tai Cheong Bakery customers, we hope everyone had a meaningful weekend with your families.⁣
⁣
We'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to our customers who experienced any delay in their food deliveries and/or responses to calls, messages or emails. Amid this circuit breaker, we are experiencing a record-breaking surge in demand and shortage of drivers during this time, and are trying our best to adapt and cater to all of you. We also understand many of you have received your orders that were short of some items, and we thank you for bringing it to our attention to allow us to resolve the problem. ⁣
⁣
Tai Cheong Bakery prioritises satisfying our customers, and we realise that mistakes have been made on our part during this incredibly tough time. Please rest assured that we are reviewing this and we will make every effort to improve our standards to deliver to all our customers. We really appreciate the support thus far and we thank you so much. #taicheongsg⁣
