Trying out something recommended by @rainbowsponge to use the frozen prata.. I’m using #chinatownprata to make chocolate prata puff. Just roll in chocolate, I also add in some banana. Egg wash after they are done and bake them until golden brown. The kid says 👍🏻 #pratachocolate #chocopuff #stayhomebaking #kidlovesit #kidbaking #stayhomesafe #stayhomesg
