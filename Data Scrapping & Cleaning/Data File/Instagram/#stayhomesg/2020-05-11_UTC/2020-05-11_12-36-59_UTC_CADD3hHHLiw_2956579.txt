CB - Day 35, 11 May 2020, dinner
Tonight's dinner is a bit of mixing things together. The hub found Japanese Tang-O which he insisted on buying even though he has no clue how to cook it 🤣...he said just boil water like eating hotpot...erm hotpot is flavoured water aka stock 好不好 😏! In the end, I decided on a K-themed dinner.
1. Fish cake soup (어묵탕) so that there's "water" to boil his Tang-O in, while the rest of us can have radish and fish cakes. 
2. Sticky sweet and spicy wing (adapted from Chef Paik's recipe so I consider it K...and the chilli is also Korean...kakaka).
3. Meat patties (완자전) and stuffed Korean chilli (고추전). #어묵탕 #stickywings #완자전 #고추전 #circuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #wfh #wfhlife #annierecipes #cookingcanbeeasy #cookingcanbefun  #cookingisahobby #annielovestocook #annieshomekitchen #annieskitchen #accookingpassion #anniecancook #accooks #masterchefannie #masterchefanniechan #privatechef #kbgotaprivatechef #cookingforkb #instafood #instadaily #foodstagram @kbannie
