Buttercream Chocolate Cake - a Mother’s Day gift for my beloved mum.

Both the buttercream and cake was made using my trusty Thermomix, with precise temperature control being an important feature! I am so sorry I cannot share the exact recipe here because it is from a piping class and is copy-righted to the instructor. (But DM me if you would like to know which instructor!) However, for more about this type of cream, the original creator and method is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldc75yT5Exw ! (Google “G.G. Glossy Buttercream”) I took the 4-hour piping class last Sept for fun but never had the chance to practise piping again because I hardly baked. Until yesterday. Lots of room for improvement, but, I am sure my mum can feel the lurve through the effort put in. 💪🏻She would know it is totally out of my comfort zone - and that’s the whole idea right? 😆 
To keep it manageable, I made  the buttercream the night before, and baked the sourcream chocolate cake on the day itself. Had great fun piping the flowers with the girls. 
Happy Mother’s Day to all wonderful mothers out there… we are truly the one-and-only best-est mommies to our kiddies. @luzerneglobal ❤️ #sgfoodie #stayhomesg #igsg #homecooksg #homechef #sghomecooks #sgfoodie #sgbaker #sgfoodblogger #sgblogger #sghomecooking #thermomixsg #singaporehomecooks #bestofthermomix #stayhomeandcook #simplehomecookedmeal #igmum #bestofthermomix #sgblogger #sgmomblogger #mealprep #homemadeprata #stayhomesg #circuitbreaker #bloggerlife #momlife #sgmummy #sgmom #koreanbuttercream #buttercreamflowers #koreanbuttercreamflower #stayhomewithluzerne
