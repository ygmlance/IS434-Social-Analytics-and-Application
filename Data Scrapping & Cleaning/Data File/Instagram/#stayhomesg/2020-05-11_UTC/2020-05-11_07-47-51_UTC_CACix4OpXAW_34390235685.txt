My take on a Pandan Gula Melaka cake, emulating the flavours of an ondeh-ondeh. This was a gift for a friend. Was in a rush, and because #circuitbreaker, I didn’t have many tools I would normally use to decorate the cake. But trust me on this one; it’s delicious. Two layers of moist, cottony pandan cake, sandwiching (and frosted with) a layer of smooth gula melaka swiss meringue buttercream and crumbled gula melaka. Lastly, some sprinkling of crunchy toasted coconut with gula melaka. Just delicious.
