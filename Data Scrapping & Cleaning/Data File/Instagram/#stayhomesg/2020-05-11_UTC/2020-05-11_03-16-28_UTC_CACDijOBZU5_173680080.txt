333 Kitchen SG
Located along Geylang Road, 333 Kitchen is a well-known zi char haunt in the area with an extensive selection of dishes. 
We tried the delicious Crab thick bee hoon with soup. Fresh live crab is used and you can immediately taste the sweetness in the crab meat. The portion is also generous and able to serve 4 persons or more. Next must try is the Prawn Paste chick wings, deep fried to golden crispy and they used large size wings as oppose to small ones found in many restaurnts. Large size wings means you are more satisfied when you bite into the thick juicy meat each time. There is the Nyonya Seafood which is a bit sweet and spicy, goes well with rice. Next is the Milky Salted Egg Prawn which is also large size. For those who crave for some spicy Thai Style chicken,you can try the Thai Style Chicken with sweet and sour sauce with a bit of spice, the chicken is crispy and packed separately from the sauce so you can just add the sauce when you are at home. 
They have many other dishes , feel free to check out their menu on their facebook page.
