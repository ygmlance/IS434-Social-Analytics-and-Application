Mums are superheroes. From nurturing a child’s curiosity, opening our eyes to the wonders of the world to making dreams come true, there’s nothing that mothers cannot do.

This Mother’s Day, @sciencecentresg has come up with the perfect formula for children and husbands to present mums with a gift of fun, beauty and bonding time learning about plant science.

With a few ingredients of flowers and food colouring, mums can be gifted with one-of-a-kind colour-changing blooms created with love.

With the live demonstration of capillary action as the white flowers transformed colour, @julesofsingapore and her son learnt how this simple experiment proves that water travels upwards through the xylem of a plant stem, even against gravity!

On this very special day in May, @sciencecentresg also honours mothers by releasing its third and final short-film of its ongoing brand campaign, More Than Just A Place.

This film presents a heart-warming tale around the bond between a time-strapped mother and her ever-inquisitive daughter. The story is a tribute that celebrates the loving and generous spirit of mums around the world.

Happy Mother's Day to all the amazing mothers out there! ❤
