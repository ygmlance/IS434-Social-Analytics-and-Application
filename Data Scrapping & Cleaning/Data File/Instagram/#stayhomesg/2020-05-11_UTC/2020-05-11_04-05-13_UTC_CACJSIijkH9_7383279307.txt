Times are rough, so why not enjoy a little? ⁠
⁠
⁠A seafood party that promises euphoria of the highest level, our Banh Canh Cua is a thick rice noodle dish that comprises—you might need a towel to catch the drool for this one—big prawns, mud crab meat, sliced pork, quail eggs and to top it all off, a whole lobster tail! ⁠
⁠
All that swimming in a rich, intensely flavoured seafood stock. ⁠
