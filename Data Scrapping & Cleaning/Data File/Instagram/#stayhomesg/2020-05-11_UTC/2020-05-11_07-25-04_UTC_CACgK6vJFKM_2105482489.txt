We understand that these may be uncertain times for everyone and if you are feeling overwhelmed by stress, here are some tips to help manage your stress and boost your immunity at the same time.

Sing
Good news for those who enjoy singing. Singing disperses stagnated liver 'qi', relieving 'qi' stagnation and promotes 'qi' and blood circulation. Singing also strengthens the spleen which is the source of 'qi' and blood. Singing is a great way to bond with your family members too!

Sleep
The ideal time to sleep according to the Meridian Clock is before 11pm. 11pm to 1am corresponds to the gall bladder meridian which is responsible for removing the body's metabolic waste products.

Try catching a 1 hour catnap between 11am to 1pm too. This period corresponds to the heart meridian. The heart pumps nutrients around the body to provide the body with energy and nutrition.

Exercise
Exercise helps to unblock the flow of 'qi' and blood, promoting 'qi' and blood circulation.
Research has shown that acute exercise enhances the immune system which improves defense activity and metabolic health, thus having anti-inflammatory effects.

Going outdoors for some light exercise for 30 minutes would be beneficial for building your immune system and relieving stress. The Vitamin D from the sun has key roles in body function and optimal health as well. Remember to maintain safe distancing while exercising outdoors! ðŸ“·: @pulsetcm .
