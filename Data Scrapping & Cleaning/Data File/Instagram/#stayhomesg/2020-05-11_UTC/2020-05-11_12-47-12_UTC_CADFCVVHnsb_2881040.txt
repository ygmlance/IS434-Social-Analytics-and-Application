After 3 failed sourdough starter, I finally managed to get 1 active starter to make this loaf! Though not perfect yet, but for the 1st loaf it sure looks and tastes good! ✌ Will definitely try another loaf soon. If anyone has tips on how to improve it, pls let me know!🙏🙏 The lil one commented, "mummy, it's breakfast time now, so I can eat more sourdough bread! (But we just had dinner)😂😂 So he went on to say, "It's breakfast time in Canada and so I can eat ur sourdough bread!"😄😄 这样都可以啊！👏👏 #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #homecooking #sghomecooks #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday35 #sourdough #sourdoughbread #baked
