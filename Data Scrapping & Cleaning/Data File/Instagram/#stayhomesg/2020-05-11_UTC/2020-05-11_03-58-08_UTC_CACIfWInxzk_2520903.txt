Ikebana or Kad≈ç, the fine art of Japanese traditional flower arrangement, came to mind while working on this piece. I remember a few years back, I was totally obsessed with the art form. Researching a lot on how this ancient art-form came about in expressing motion through arrangements of materials. It was abstract way before abstract was even a genre or maybe even a word. The time taken to create compositions in this particular way apparently are often used as a period of reflection during which time stands still. It was really an appropriate time when I embark on this spiritual journey around this piece of work, late last night, when almost everyone was asleep. Really dead silent. I may work on this as a series now that the obsession for Ikebana is back. Stay tuned. Decided to work on a 66cm x 101.6cm (W) Saunders Waterford CP (Cold Pressed) Watercolour Paper for this for the rough textured base. #abstract #abstractart  #ikebana #contemporaryart #contemporaryartist #decklededge #watercolor #watercolorpainting #ikebanaflowers #artoninstagram #14daysstayhomenotice #andyyangsookit @instinc_space #staythefuckhome #stayhomesg @danielsmithartistsmaterials @st_cuthberts_mill #homestudio
