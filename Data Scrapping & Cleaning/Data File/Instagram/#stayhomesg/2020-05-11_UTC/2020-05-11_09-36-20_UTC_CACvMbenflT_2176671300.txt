Reality of this circuit breaker: our meals are alot healthier, being home made, but sometimes “topsy turvy”... this evening, we plan to have sandwiches for dinner 🥪 Are you in the same situation?

Homemade Mexican Club Sandwiches by Danielle @danielleatz looks so appetising 😋 Thank you for getting these Organic Baked Beans and Eggs from us 💖
.
“The Eden Baked Beans actually had a "mexican" taste to it, hence the dish's name. Adding some shredded cheese to lend extra flavor to it. 
It's good to use whatever you have in the fridge, cut down wastage.
I used the balance serving of Lettuce, Gluten-Free Ham from previous Brunch session. 
And the Free-Range Egg was delish in making the Scrambled Eggs.”
