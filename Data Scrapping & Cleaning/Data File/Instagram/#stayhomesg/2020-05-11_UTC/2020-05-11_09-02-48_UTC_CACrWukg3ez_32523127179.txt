Basic Sourdough 🍞
.
🍴Overall ease: 2/10
.
🛒Ingredients: rye starter, bread flour, salt, water
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: feed the starter twice, autolyse for 1 hour, mix, slap and fold 16 times, laminate, coil fold, bulk ferment 12 hours, bake from cold, with ice cubes in the Dutch oven to create steam for the crust.
.
😋Taste: 10/10. Decided to return to the basics and refine our technique. Changes aplenty, but the key ones were to slap and fold, laminate, and coil fold (as opposed to stretch and fold), and all under air conditioning! The cooler air slowed down the ferment and allowed the bread to build structure. Definitely our best loaf so far. Our family gobbled up half a loaf within 30 mins!
