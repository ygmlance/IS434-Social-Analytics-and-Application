Circuit breaker Day 35: Ramen finally 👍Loved how they kept the noodles separate from the broth, this means my noodles weren’t soggy. The tonkotsu broth was yum, wouldn’t go for the black tonkotsu or the spicy one again. Chashu is sliced wayyy too thinly, even thinner than shabu shabu slices. Still pretty worth it, 4 ramen + gyoza for $50 (free delivery).
