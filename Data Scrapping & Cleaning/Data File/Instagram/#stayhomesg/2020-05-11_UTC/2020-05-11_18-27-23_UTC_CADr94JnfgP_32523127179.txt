Kueh Salat (version II) 🌱
.
🍴Overall ease: 5/10
.
🛒Ingredients: glutinous rice, coconut milk, eggs, pandan juice (from leaves), butterfly pea flower
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: second time around with @ieatishootipost’s recipe. Continued to cut down the sugar, but no other significant changes.
.
😋Taste: 10/10. Version II was definitely more aesthetically pleasing than the earlier try! Taste-wise, both were pretty similar, although the custard here was distinctly smoother, and the rice a touch stickier. Still loving this recipe! Next time around, we might increase the ratio of custard to rice, just because we love the custard layer so much!
