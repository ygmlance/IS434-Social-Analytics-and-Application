📍🇯🇵 Arashiyama, Kyoto

A long walk passing by a scenic view of the river and mountains is this tiny % Arabica coffee shop located in Arashiyama. We visited the place during summer so getting this definitely helped us beat the summer heat, well, at least a little🤭 Even though the queue wasn't really long, we still waited quite a while in line.

Great iced caffe latte! Not too sure about the difference, but I got the blend instead of single origin. Also, the aroma of coffee was much more prominent here as compared to the one I had in sg which was on the milkier side😌
