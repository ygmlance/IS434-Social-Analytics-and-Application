💐Write it in your heart that everyday is the best day of the year. 💐 mmm... a bit difficult for everyday to be the “best day” but I think we can strive for a positive-attitude-day everyday. You can be upset or down but you don’t let the negativity gets too deep into you. You pick yourself up and move on quickly. You reflect promptly, persevere on, try again and again because you remain positive that things will get right one day...eventually. BUT, you must also exercise judgement. If it is something not worth hanging on such as an activity or relationship that’s toxic, then giving up and moving on quickly is a wiser option. Jia you to all who are trying to make the best out of everyday! 💪Today, I tried to remake my favourite Ikea style hotdog- with mustard sauce and tomato sauce but I customized it with fried egg, margarine and black pepper. So so yummy! 😋Mustard sauce and tomato sauce are such a great pair! And pairing with my cedar goldfish baked crackers again. I need to find a blue plate soon for the underwater backdrop. Today’s drink is Starbucks  3-in-1 caffe latte! I found some cookies stencils that I bought in Japan and tried to do coffee stencil art! Can you tell that it’s a heart arrow? The cocoa powder dissolved quickly just as I’m moving the coffee from kitchen to dining table. Never mind, I’ll try again next time! 😘
