May is Lupus awareness month and yesterday was World Lupus Day ðŸ’œ 
For those of us suffering with Lupus or any kind of underlying illness, it has been a harrowing couple of months. We have had to endure lockdowns and the fear of contracting Covid-19. Lupus sufferers have over-active, compromised immune systems which make us more susceptible to infections. If we do contract Covid-19, our symptoms are more likely to be severe. So for those living with illness, I pray you stay safe and find what works for you, especially at this time. 
There is no cure for this chronic condition but Iâ€™m happy to say that Iâ€™m in a good place and in remission! It took a lot of patience to get here and I am proud to be a #lupuswarrior. 
Ps: I didnâ€™t have the courage to post the 2nd photo of me going through chemo, as is. So I hid it behind a random photo of myself ðŸ˜…
