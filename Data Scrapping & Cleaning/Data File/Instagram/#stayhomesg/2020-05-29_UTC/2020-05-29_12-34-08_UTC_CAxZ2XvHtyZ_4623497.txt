Hunter’s favourite song 🕺🏼🐵 at the moment.. which he plays on repeat alllll daaaaaaay lonnnnng.

The nice thing about being home 24/7 is the musical fun the kids are having 🎶

The boys have discovered the music genres they’re into - Hunter loves pop and love songs💋 , and Carter is into dance and rock music🎸

Couple of videos here of the kids, for memories’ sake!
