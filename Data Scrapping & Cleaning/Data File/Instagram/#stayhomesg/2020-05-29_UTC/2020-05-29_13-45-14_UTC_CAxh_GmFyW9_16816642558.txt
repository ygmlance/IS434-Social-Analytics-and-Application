#B4IMGONEChallenge

Name: @lincolnofficially 
Country: Singapore 🇸🇬 Love me: If #B4ImGone is a song for the unsung heroes, then Lincoln Lim might be on the top of my list. As a Singaporean Alternative Rock & Blues Singer-Songwriter, his pen game is just as brilliant as his falsetto.  He repped Singapore last year at BIGSOUND 2019, and in my opinion should be front and centre representing Singapore music at every opportunity. The release of his first single 'Her’, peaked at 23rd place on the Singapore Spotify Viral 50 charts because, as @JUICE puts it best, “At only 23 years old, Lim channels heartache in a way that some performers take decades to develop.” Conversations with Lincoln inspire me to quit everything and be his 'Don King', so that this humble artist has a rapper friend yelling his praises into a bullhorn until the world sits up and really takes in the depth of his beautiful music. He deserves it a million times over, so do yourself a favour, pour yourself a glass of whiskey, dim the lights and listen to Lincoln's debut EP ‘Gravity’ bit.ly/Gravity_LincolnLim
Fave #LincolnLim Song: 'Her' a simple song to explain very complicated feelings. His heart breaking vocals, the instrumentation...I'm scouring the internet for the lyrics. My other Lincoln Lim favourite is the future song we're going to make together. ----
