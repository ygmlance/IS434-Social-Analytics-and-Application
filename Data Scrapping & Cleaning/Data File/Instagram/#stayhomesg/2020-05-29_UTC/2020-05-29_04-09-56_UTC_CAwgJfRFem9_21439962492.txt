As of 28 May 6.30pm, we have given away a total of 6548 packets of chicken rice! 3 more days left to get your free chicken rice, so do inform any frontliners you know! We have also decided to go beyond 200 packets a day, as we would like to provide for as many frontliners that show up. If you would like to be a part of this campaign, you can Paynow with the QR code in the picture above or type in the UEN: 201821224D. Thank you for your support! XiaoManNiu Together with You!
