Basic Sourdough 🍞
.
🍴Ease of cooking: 3/10
.
🛒Ingredients: 15% whole wheat, 85% Meizhan Banh Mi flour, water, salt
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: Same as always, except this time we tried a new bread flour - banh mi flour!
.
😋Taste: 9/10. Of all the basic sourdoughs baked, this was the best yet! Crusty, soft on the inside, a nice ear, and an airy crumb structure. The family gobbled this up within the day! But never 10/10 because we can always improve!
