Another dish struck of my bucket list. Been wanting to cook { Beef bourguignon } aka Red Wine Beef Stew and I finally did it this week :D
.
Please tell me that my dish passed the visual test .. since I canâ€™t offer to any of you at this point in time for the taste test ðŸ¤ª. The beef chucks were fork tender after 3 -4 hours of simmering under low fire. I couldnâ€™t resist eating it at the 4th hour as the red wine infused gravy is irresistible- this my other half and mom in law can attest for. Tasted even better the next day ðŸ¤“
.
Itâ€™s not a difficult dish to master. Watch a few tutorials , read a couple of blogs and here it is :)
by the way , there is no need to buy expensive cuts for this dish .. get the beef chucks or just tell the grocer or butcher is for stews. I got mine at $14. .
