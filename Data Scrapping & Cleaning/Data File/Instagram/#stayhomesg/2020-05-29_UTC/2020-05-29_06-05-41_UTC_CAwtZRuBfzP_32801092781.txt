Circuit breaker Day 53: @donplayplaysg rice bowls! 👍👍👍 All 3 bowls ordered were so yummy (& felt healthy!):
- Chicken yakitori (who knew yakitori could be so good?)
- Unagi (different from the usual because they pair it with garlic rice)
- Truffle beef (a hint of truffle & sauce on the side so you can control how much you want)
Portions were just right, all the eggs were on point - flowyyy. They are halal certified & currently teaming up with Hvala for deliveries btw!
📍Don Play Play (gotta order, don’t think they have a store 🤔)
