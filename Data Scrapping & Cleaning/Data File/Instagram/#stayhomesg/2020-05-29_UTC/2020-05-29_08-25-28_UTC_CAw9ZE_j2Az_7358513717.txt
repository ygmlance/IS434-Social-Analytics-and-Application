Ingredients /fish paste/
500-700g minced yellowtail fish @superseafoodsg

-Add fish paste into the bowl and mix well
-Divide into 16 portions. Make into a ball and flattened into a patty (about 1cm thick)

-Fry about 1-2 mins each side and add 1 tbsp water cover and let it “steam”
-Serve warm with your favorite chilli sauce or lime

*If you don’t have a food processor or in my case concerned about cross-contamination, you may tenderize the fish using the back of a knife. Gather and tenderize. Repeat until the fish becomes a paste. Knead in sake, ginger, pepper, and salt. Knead and “throw” the paste a few times. Prepare a small bowl of water. Wet hand and repeat “knead and throw” method until the fish paste is smooth. Move on to next steps (mix vegetables etc.)
