Earlier this year, the Shentonista community decided on our two Shentonistas Of The Year. We’d planned to bring our winners out for a specially curated experience—and then, Covid-19 hit.

While many plans had to change along the way, today, we’re taking the time to celebrate our winners—Theresa (Popular Choice winner) and Eunice (Team’s Choice winner). We planned the perfect day indoors for the both of them with the help of some of the people we’ve had the good fortune of working with in the past year—read the full feature on our unique day in with our SOTY winners at the link in our profile.
