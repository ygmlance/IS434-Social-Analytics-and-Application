Another human that I love and admire as an artist and had the pleasure of working with him @joshuasimonxl ‚Ä¢ @masiaone #B4IMGONE Song Challenge
It's #NewMusicFriday in Singapore, so I've decided today's postings will represent the best of the Lion City. .

Name: @joshuasimonxl üá∏üá¨
Country: Singapore 
Love me: Joshua Simon has been a prominent figure in Singapore‚Äôs media industry for over 10 years as both a radio deejay and musician. He is well known for insightful interviews with celebrities like Hugh Jackman, Ryan Reynolds, Katy Perry and Britney Spears, yet when I look at Josh I see him as no different from their level of talent. In 2019, Joshua Simon released his debut album, 'Filthy', a 10-track record has been streamed over 150,000 times on Spotify and hailed by @bandwagonasia as "one of the best albums to come out of Singapore".
Yes he was invited to London's iconic Abbey Road Studios to record a  rendition of the Oscar-nominated 'This Is Me' alongside Keala Settle from The Greatest Showman in 2017 and in the following year to 20th Century Fox to record a Queen Medley as part of a viral music video campaign for the hit film, Bohemian Rhapsody. With all these incredible experiences, I've been blessed to call Josh a friend, so I get sporadic song idea voice notes from him from time to time sent through What's App and believe me when I tell you - they are raw, tender, poetic and a perfect reflection of an artist. .

‚òØÔ∏è Masia's Fave #JoshuaSimon Song: Josh‚Äôs latest release ‚ÄúAll I Wanna Do‚Äù is blowing up right now but I‚Äôm a sucker for "Tokyo", produced by @alxtalhinhas (producer of #B4ImGone), which creates an audio canvas for Josh's poetic dedication to his favourite city. I‚Äôm in love with the line "The trains they lead to everywhere". My #ChineyMoney side wants at to get this song a sync and licensing deal STAT! .
