@lincolnofficially  you are going to do great things!!! • @masiaone #B4IMGONEChallenge 
Friday night, pour yourself a tall glass of whiskey, kick back and fall in love with the voice of this Singaporean artist. .

Name: @lincolnofficially 
Country: Singapore 🇸🇬
Love me: If #B4ImGone is a song for the unsung heroes, then Lincoln Lim might be on the top of my list. As a Singaporean Alternative Rock & Blues Singer-Songwriter, his pen game is just as brilliant as his falsetto.  He repped Singapore last year at BIGSOUND 2019, and in my opinion should be front and centre representing Singapore music at every opportunity. The release of his first single 'Her’, peaked at 23rd place on the Singapore Spotify Viral 50 charts because, as @juicemagazine puts it best, “At only 23 years old, Lim channels heartache in a way that some performers take decades to develop.” Conversations with Lincoln inspire me to quit everything and be his 'Don King', so that this humble artist has a rapper friend yelling his praises into a bullhorn until the world sits up and really takes in the depth of his beautiful music. He deserves it a million times over, so do yourself a favour, dim the lights and listen to Lincoln's debut EP ‘Gravity’ bit.ly/Gravity_LincolnLim
. ☯️ Masia’s Fave #LincolnLim Song: 'Her' a simple song to explain very complicated feelings. His heart breaking vocals, the instrumentation...I'm scouring the internet for the lyrics. My other Lincoln Lim favourite is the future song we're about to make together. 😉
