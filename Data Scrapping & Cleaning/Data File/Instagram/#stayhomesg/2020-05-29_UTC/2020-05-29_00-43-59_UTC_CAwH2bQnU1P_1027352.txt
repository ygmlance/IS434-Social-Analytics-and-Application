I was honestly amazed at the products and brands from @classicfinefoodssg I received last week to mark the launch of their NEW website for consumers: @classicdelisg. And I am not ashamed to say I squealed like a schoolgirl and came close to hyperventilating when I pulled out the big box of frozen Spanish Carabinero Prawns - a seafood I adore! Couldnâ€™t wait to savour them and since I donâ€™t trust my cooking skills, I figured grilling would be the least risky way to go. So out of storage came an old Tefal grill and on went the crustaceans to become dinner.
It was pretty breathtaking when the neatly-packed crimson-coloured crustaceans were first revealed. But nothing beat the view of them sizzling on the grill coupled with the insane aroma.
I know thereâ€˜s bound to be a few of you who will watch my video and wonder why we separated the prawn heads from the bodies. Letâ€™s just say in my household, some of us like their prawns sans heads while others canâ€™t get enough of them. So this arrangement worked out nicely ðŸ˜Š. If you too want to gorge on these Red King Prawn #Carabineros from @PeixosdePalamos, a Spanish family-run business with a network spanning more than 30 countries, or shop for other premium products that are purportedly the preferred purchase of restaurants and hotels, please tap on the link in @classicdelisgâ€™s bio.
