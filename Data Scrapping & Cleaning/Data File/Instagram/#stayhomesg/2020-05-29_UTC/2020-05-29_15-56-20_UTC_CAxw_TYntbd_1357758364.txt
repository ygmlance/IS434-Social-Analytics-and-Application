This past week had been fun-filled and eventful for us as we welcome our students back to class, virtually, for the first time after two months of class suspension. The children exhibited great imagination and creativity during the classes. We were very encouraged when they feedbacked to us that they had enjoyed the sessions and would like to join more online classes again. More photos on our Facebook page.
