#B4IMGONE Song Challenge

It's #NewMusicFriday in Singapore, so today's postings will come from 
artists that help shape the sound of the Lion City. 
Name: @joshuasimonxl ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Country: Singapore 
Love me #b4imgone: Joshua Simon has been a prominent figure in Singaporeâ€™s media industry for over 10 years as both a radio deejay and musician. He is well known for insightful interviews with celebrities like Hugh Jackman, Ryan Reynolds, Katy Perry and Britney Spears, yet when I look at Josh I see him as no different from their level of talent and charismatic energy. 
In 2019, Joshua Simon released his debut album, 'Filthy', a 10-track record has been streamed over 150,000 times on Spotify and hailed by @Bandwagon as "one of the best albums to come out of Singapore".
Yes he was invited to London's iconic Abbey Road Studios to record a rendition of the Oscar-nominated 'This Is Me' alongside Keala Settle from The Greatest Showman in 2017 and in the following year to 20th Century Fox to record a Queen Medley as part of a viral music video campaign for the hit film, Bohemian Rhapsody. 
Masia's Fave #JoshuaSimon Song: "Tokyo", produced by @Alx (producer of #B4ImGone) creates an audio canvas for Josh's poetry for his favourite city, in love with the line "The trains they lead to everywhere". ----
