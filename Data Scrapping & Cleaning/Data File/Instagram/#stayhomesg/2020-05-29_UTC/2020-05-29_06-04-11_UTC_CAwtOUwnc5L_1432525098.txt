How have your WFH been? Most probably it has been a tough ride for most, for us, having to shift everything from our office back was a really tough one as our lease ended. With loads of inventories, our rooms are literally like a can of sardines 😆 but thankfully without incurring more expenses, we will aim to brave through this pandemic.

To us, it seemed to be a fruitful one during the stay home period. Repaired main door locks, electrical sockets, lights, damaged window hinges, organised and cleared so many unwanted litter, donated some old Mac desktops, cooked like no tomorrow (and satisfying when all the dishes are finished), replaced sink, water filters, organising the entire kitchen rack. 
Sounds similar? Let us know what good did you find out in the WFH days? Share the positivity 😉❤️❤️❤️ And not forgetting thank God for everything 🙏
