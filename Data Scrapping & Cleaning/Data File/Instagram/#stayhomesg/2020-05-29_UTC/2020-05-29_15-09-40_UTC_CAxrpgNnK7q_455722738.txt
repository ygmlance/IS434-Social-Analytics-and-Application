Yeah it's weekend! Keep smiling my Kieden boy!
We have finally come to the end of the circuit breaker... you will be re-joining your playgroup on 10 Jun after 2 months of absence ... ðŸ˜…
Hope you can adjust better this time. Jiayou..ðŸ˜…
Having you at home all the time is both stressful and happy for wfh mum. You are curious and like to seek attention all the time...I always call you a naughty boy... Hopefully you can be more disciplined after going back to school... #eveningwalk #smilyboy #birdwatching #bondingtime #kiedenwong #toddlerlife #almost2 #23monthsold #sgmummies #sgparenting #sgboy #sgtoddler #cb #stayhomesg #shotbyxperiaxz2 #mummylove
