Filthy Friday

People always ask why I am so sweaty in my videos. I can't explain. 15 min after Filthy Friday workout by @stuartdiplock @crossfitmobilus, I am still sweating! Intense workouts like that take me sometimes an hour to before I dry up. 
Today's workout is a mean one!

25 min time cap
3 Rounds of

40 dumbbell reverse lunge
30 Ground to Overhead
20 Burpees

On every minute, 20 lateral hops

I was short of 18 burpees after 25 min! Somehow, I think I had enough of 22.5 kg dumbbell for the year 2020.
