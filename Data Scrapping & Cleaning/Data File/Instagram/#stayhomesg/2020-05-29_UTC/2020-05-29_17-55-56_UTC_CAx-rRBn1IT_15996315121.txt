Slow-cooked “Lor Ark” (Duck)

Loving the gentle slow-cook function of the Thermomix. I sauted some aromatics, threw in some spices (Cloves, Cinnamon, Star Anise) and covered the seasoned meat with water. Set to 1 hour 50 mins, 98 degrees at slow cook mode. The end result was succulent, juicy duck meat in a light, aromatic sauce (Swipe to see the video). Plain porridge was cooked in 25 mins in my other Thermie. If you do not have two units, simply keep the duck meat warm while you boil the porridge. 
We cooked “lor ark” for two lunches consecutively because I bought one whole duck and we ate just half a duck per meal. There was just nothing left in the fridge! Not that anyone minded. 
Just reflecting on how home-cooked meals really saved us so much money; investing in a Thermomix is one of the best decisions I have made. I gladly recommend it to my family and friends and I would to you too! DM me for more information; let me be your Thermomix Advisor.
