🍪AIR FRYER COOKIES🍪
It’s up it’s up!!! SO MANY REQUESTS for this, sorry it took awhile cuz there’s a lot of editing to be done for the recipe hahaha - I tried my best to tweak it to a beginner-friendly level and it’s relatively simple to make. Great for those without an oven! I’ll leave the recipe below too but try to watch the video to see how each step is done and how the texture looks like before moving to the next step okie. As always, I’m a DM away, if y’all have any questions or need any help, just let me know. EGG TARTS ARE NEXT!!! 😝😝😝 #ShersVideoRecipes

PS!!! When you place your cookies in the airfryer, please leave space between them because they will puff up & when you flip your cookies, do not that they are still half baked so be gentle. #AirfryerCookies
