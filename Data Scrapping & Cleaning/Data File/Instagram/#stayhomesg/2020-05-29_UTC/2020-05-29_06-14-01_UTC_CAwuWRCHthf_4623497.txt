Bedtime readingðŸ“š is a pretty relaxed time for me now... Hunter is quietly absorbed - as always - in his books (heâ€™s currently way into science encyclopaedias), and Carter and Chloe read and cuddle together.

I really feel the past 2 months of being locked down at home has made my kids waaaay closer to each other, and they get along so well now. Arguments are rareðŸ¤­

Are your kids better together now?
Or is WW3 about to happen in your home?ðŸ˜…
