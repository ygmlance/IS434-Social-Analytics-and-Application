I always do small studies like this when planning for the tutorials. It helps me to organize my painting process and thoughts better. When painting for myself, I donâ€™t have a clear process or linear steps, cos I donâ€™t like to think too much when painting. But when Iâ€™m teaching, I have to rationalize my thoughts and structure the process such that itâ€™s achievable by the students. For that, I have to constantly question my choices and put myself in the shoes of beginners. Itâ€™s tiring for the mindðŸ˜”, but as long as there are people who appreciates the videos, itâ€™s worth it!
