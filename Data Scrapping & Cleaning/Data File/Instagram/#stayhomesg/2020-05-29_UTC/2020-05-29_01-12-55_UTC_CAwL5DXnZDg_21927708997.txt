It’s the end of another week! The best part is, I don’t have to work until Monday! It’s the end of the school holiday and I want to make the most of it before we jump back to the craziness of HBL again. My working hours had been crazy, too. One week of going home late at night and one week of going home in mid-afternoon. I haven’t been able to kiss the kids goodnight this whole week because they’ve gone to sleep by the time I come home. Covid has changed the world’s routine big time! It only proves what Forrest Gump had said all along: life is a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get. So just pick a chocolate and take a bite!
