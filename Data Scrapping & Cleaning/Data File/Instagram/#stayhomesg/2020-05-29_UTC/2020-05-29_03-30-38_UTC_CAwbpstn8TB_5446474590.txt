Up-cycle auntie is back with new project.
Found these pom poms on my grocery shopping and decide to train the girls chopsticks skill. Especially Rox, she doesn't even know how to hold it properly.

We use the paper egg trays from my group buy(yes! You heard it group buy for eggs) and the extra paints from #daboxart. Did the painting yesterday allowing it to dry thoroughly.
Simple and cheap, adding spend challenge make it more fun!
