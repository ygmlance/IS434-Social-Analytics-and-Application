My Singapore, my neighbourhood. Did a paper collage on day 53 of #circuitbreakersg ... looking forward to next week! 😊 This paper collage is an upcycled craft. Painted the blank side of some one-sided printed paper and did some cutting and pasting. Something simple that you can do too while you are staying safe at home. 😊♻️ .......... #papercollage #collageart #cutandpastecollage #upcyclingpaper #reducereuserecycle #stayhomesg #SGunited #mysingapore #myneighborhood #zerowastesg #zerowastecraft #handmadesg #sghandmade #wahsosimple
