Hae Bee Hiam (Dried Shrimp Sambal)

Just finished doing a portion of the Hae Bee Hiam and taking a rest as my legs are tired from the standing and arms from the continuous stirring.

This certainly comes in handy as you can stir-fry them with Kang Kong, Lady's Fingers or Potatoe Leaves just to name a few.

I like to have my bread with the hae bee hiam mixed into my sunny side up eggs, simply delicious.
