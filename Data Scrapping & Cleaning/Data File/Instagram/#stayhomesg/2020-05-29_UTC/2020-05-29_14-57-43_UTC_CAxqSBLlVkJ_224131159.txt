This year’s celebration is a little different as I usually travel during this time of the year..
.
I had to stay home this time but it doesn’t mean that it is less special, thanks to my lovely friends who made this day special for me even during this time..
.
Blessed to have received all the bday goodies from all of you today, some of which not featured here because they already ended up in my tummy 😂 but they will definitely be featured in my upcoming quarantine bday vlog.. so, look out for it 😉
.
Thanks again for all your kind wishes and for celebrating this day with me, making sure I don’t go hungry or feel lonely through zoom calls etc 😂 Love you guys ❤️
