| PAO DE QUEIJO🍘| More like a toasted mochi than a pao, these Brazilian cheese paos are super addictive esp when eaten warm! 😍 I added generous amounts of mozzarella & chilli cheese, adding some kick to it 🌶 Just look at them sizzling in the 3rd video 😍
This was also a great way to finish up our tapioca flour after making Mee Hoon Kueh hehe 😋
.
For those who are keen, search “Fann Wong Brazilian Pao recipe” - I used the one posted by Women’s Weekly magazine hehe 😊
