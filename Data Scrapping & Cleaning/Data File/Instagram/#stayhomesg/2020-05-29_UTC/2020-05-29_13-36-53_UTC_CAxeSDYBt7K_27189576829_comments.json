I really agree to your point about the gap and it does still exist. That's why it's hard to see much lasting changes although we do see improvements in our community. Gotta emphasize the importance of ground-up initiatives like TLS to keep our youths engaged, inspired, and have someone to look up to. Hopefully there will be that ripple effect and thebfuture generations will be so much more empowered, in its true meaning. Keep doing what you guys are doing \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude04",
