THANK YOU | Growing up, many teachers have taught and guided us as we travel through the intense education journey in Singapore. These teachers don't just teach, they mentor, counsel, plan events, meet parents and address their concerns and more... In this season, they've worked even harder behind the scenes to deliver lessons and to reach out to every student. Thank you to the teachers out there giving in their best to educate and bring out the best in everyone!
