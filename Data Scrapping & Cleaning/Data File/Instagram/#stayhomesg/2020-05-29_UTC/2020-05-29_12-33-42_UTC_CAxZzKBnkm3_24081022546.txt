We do have male customer using our ellure mask too!

Ellure Tomato Resonance Graphene Bubble Mask is Singapore formulated, to dissolve and remove the dead skin cells without scrubbing and damaging the skin protection. While exfoliating, it also stores and replenishes hydration, providing other skin benefits altogether. Exfoliation not only helps many skin problems, it also increases blood circulation, which in turn helps you to achieve healthy and glowing skin. It is the first step in having a healthy skin care regime.
