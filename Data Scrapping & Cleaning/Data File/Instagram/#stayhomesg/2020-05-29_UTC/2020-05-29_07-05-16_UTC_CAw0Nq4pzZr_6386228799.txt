Did you know tomatoes are full of antioxidants, especially lycopene,which has been linked to reduced risk of heart disease and cancer? They are also a great source of vitamin C, K and folate. Also, it is great to protect your skin. Do you know a recipe that uses raw tomatoes? Gazpacho!!!! I can never have enough of this soup. Now that summer is coming (even though it is summer every single day here in Singapore) I feel than when June arrives, it has a different feeling and you crave for this type of food even more...
Recipe:
6-8 ripen tomatoes (I prefer Roma tomatoes) 
1 garlic clove chopped
1 red bell pepper diced
1 cucumber diced
1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
Salt to taste
1/2 tsp white wine vinegar or whatever vinegar you like!
Ice water to top it, depends on how liquid or thick you like it. I usually drink it so I make mine quite liquid.

Put all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Add olive oil, salt, vinegar and water. Mix well, and keep in the fridge until serving. If you are not serving it immediately, don’t add the vinegar, add it just before serving so it doesn’t get too sour. 👍. #spanishfood #comidaespañola #gazpacho #spanishfoodsingapore #vegan #coldsoup #coldsouprecipe #plantbasednutrition #veganrecipes #easyveganrecipes #plantbasedrecipes #csnn #culinarynutrition #singaporenutrition #healthyrecipes #summerrecipes #summerfood #tomatoes #notsalad #stayhomesg #stayhomechallenge #cookathome #skinfood #diabetesfood
