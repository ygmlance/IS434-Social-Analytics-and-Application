You may have read about Button, the first Hokkien Therapy Dog ever in the news a few years ago! Her story is one that is sad and touching, yet inspiring and heartening. ❤️ “Button: The Hokkien Therapy Dog” Book tells the story of how Button became a certified therapy dog, as well as the many lives that she touched along the way. 🐕

Rescued by Fiona, the founder of Hope Dog Rescue and author of this book, Button's plight had also brought to light the dark side of the local dog-breeding industry. 💔 “Button: The Hokkien Therapy Dog” Book is now available at KOHEPETS for just $18.90! All proceeds will go to @hopedogrescue and help them save & feed the homeless dogs in Singapore. 🐾 📷: @elliebeanssss
