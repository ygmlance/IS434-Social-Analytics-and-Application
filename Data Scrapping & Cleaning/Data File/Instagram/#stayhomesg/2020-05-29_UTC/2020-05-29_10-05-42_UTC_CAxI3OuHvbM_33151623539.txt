Sitting at my desk wholeday, i am trying to cut down the protein intake (meat/difficult digest protein), what kind of food should i take?

We received feedback/question yesterday after releasing new series IGTV. (To re-watch, Go to our profile and click IGTV > View Drafts.) Take all kinds of light, digestible and nutritious food instead!

For example: All kind of roots and vegetables, yogurt, peanut extract milk (remember to drain before serve), coconut milk, banana, presoak/fermented beans.. Dietary proteins aren’t intended to be used for energy, but instead manufacture hundreds of proteins in the body, from hair, skin and muscle to hormones and enzymes critical to healthy body function. This process happens continually, so proteins aren’t in demand the way carbs are... Excessive protein is not used efficiently by the body and may impose a metabolic burden on the bones, kidneys, and liver... #Camellia_Somen #Potato_Leaves
1. Cook the somen according to pack instructions. (Organic Somen by Hakubaku)
2. Drain the somen thouroughly
3. Mix with soy sauce #千禾brand, camellia oil (easy to digest) and sesame oil.
4. Stir fry tomato (remove skin), carrot, potato leaves,  green chilli with olive oil + seasalt.

Note: Introduce more Green Leaves into your meal, Chlorophyll accelerates the speed of the production of lymph.
