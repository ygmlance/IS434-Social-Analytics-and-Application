IN MY DEFENSE 
I only had one bite of these delicious fruit tarts by new cafe The Pantry at Dempsey (not affiliated with the defunct The Pantry at Loewen) but instead part of the @comodempsey group with @kids21. My family enjoyed the rest of the fruit tarts (I was trying to be good). My favourites were the kale salad and the fish goujons coated in coconut and almond (kept their crisp even as a takeaway). The fam enjoyed the burgers. Swipe for the takeaway set picture ($40). They have the most amazing playground that patrons will be able to use for free once the #circuitbreaker is over and playgrounds can reopen. Hands up who canâ€™t wait for that to happen? 
Thanks for lunch @thepantryatdempsey .
