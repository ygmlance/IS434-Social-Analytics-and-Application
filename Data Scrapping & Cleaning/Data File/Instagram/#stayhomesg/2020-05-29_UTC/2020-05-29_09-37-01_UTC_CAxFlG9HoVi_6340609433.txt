Curry Fish Head 🐟, $33 from SUM KEE FOOD. ⠀
⠀
SUM KEE FOOD has always been one of our favourite Chinese Zi Char restaurant as their prices are affordable and they have a few remarkable dishes which we enjoys.⠀ ⠀
⠀
Curry Fish Head is one of their ever-popular dish and is one of our fav dish too. They uses fresh Red Snapper and the fish head is relatively big for the price, very meaty. Fish meat is very smooth and silky, with no fishy smell👍🏻. Apart from the fish head, there’s also Tau Pok, brinjal and lady fingers fully soaked in that irresistible signature curry gravy! Curry gravy is very fragrant, not too spicy and there’s also chilli leaves, lemongrass and dried shrimp in it which makes it so delicious! If you love to have more curry gravy like us, you can top up $5 for more curry gravy. If you prefer more veg in your curry fish head you may also top up another $5 for more ⠀

Very impressed with their food delivery! It’s SUPERB! Food is still very hot when we received them and it doesn’t need to be reheated, yayy! ⠀
