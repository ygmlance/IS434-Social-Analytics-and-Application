During this #CircuitBreaker period, we are washing more frequently to keep our family away from germs & bacteria. Yet, there are always unpredictable weather where you would need to take your laundry in and out to dry. Why not get an Electrolux dryer where you could either get it stacked/wall mounted within your limited space while getting your laundry dry without  having to worry about your laundry being wet or dirty again?
