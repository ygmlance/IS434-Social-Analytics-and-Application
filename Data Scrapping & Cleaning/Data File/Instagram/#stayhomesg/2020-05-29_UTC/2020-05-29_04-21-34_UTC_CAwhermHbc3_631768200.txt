O.K. Here is the steps on how to make this Steamed Bread Pudding.

First cut the bread into cubes. 3 slices.
Mixed egg, soya milk, and lemon juice. The original recipe used vanilla essence. I change to lemon juice. And the milk i change to soya milk instead of plain milk.
Put the bread in a bowl and pour in the egg mixture and let it soaked.
Line a pan with aluminium foil and oil a little bit.
Layer the bread and added in the cranberries and chocolate. 
The first layer add the bread and add chocolate, topped with bread and layer Cranberries and layer bread again 3rd layer is a mixed of both chocolate & cranberries 
Top up with bread again and add in all the balance cranberries & chocolate as garnished.
Cover with cling wraps.
Steamed.
