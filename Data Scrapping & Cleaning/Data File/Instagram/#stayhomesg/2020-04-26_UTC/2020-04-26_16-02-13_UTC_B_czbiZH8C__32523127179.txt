😋Taste: 10/10. Inspired by what we separately tasted and loved at @miznon_tlv and @miznonmelbourne , we set out to recreate this dish. The floret edges were crispy and smoky while the stems turn tender, but weren’t soggy. Sublime, spectacular, stunning - there aren’t enough superlatives to describe how much we loved it!
