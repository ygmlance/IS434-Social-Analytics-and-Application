😋Taste: 9/10. Rifted off yet another #ottolenghi recipe, albeit with the addition of mint leaves which we had lying around. The mint turned out to be the MVP, proving the freshness that balanced the other heavier components. An effortless dish.

If we improved our plating, perhaps it could pass off as semi-fine dining? 🙈
