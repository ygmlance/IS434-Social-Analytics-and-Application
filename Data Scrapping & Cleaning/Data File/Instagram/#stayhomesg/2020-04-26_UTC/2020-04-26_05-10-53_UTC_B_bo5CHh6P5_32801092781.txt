Circuit breaker Day 20: Pizza from @docitaliana.sg 👍👍 Ordered:
- Fritto misto (assortment of seafood 🦐 🦑 🐟 this was my favvv item)
- Parma rucola
- 4 formaggi (blue cheese taste was real strong, but i think in a good way)
- Capricciosa
Overall very good, very generous with the toppings but found the crust to be a tad thick for my liking. Min $80 for free delivery guys😉
📍d.o.c (Tanjong Pagar)
