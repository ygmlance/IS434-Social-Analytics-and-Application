At 2 years old, the toddlerâ€™s brain is like a sponge. It is pretty much very curious to learn. When we could go outdoors, she would touch and feel the plants, the sand and whatever is around her. Curiously learning about how things feel between her fingers and looking at the different forms. This is very normal for very young kids. They love a lot of sensory play because they are still learning a lot from their environment through their senses: touch, feel, see, smell, hear & taste. 
Now, having to stay more at home, I have to be creative to have my toddler still have this sensory play indoors. Sensory play may include playing with different textures such as finger paint, having fun with bubbles or get them to help baking! Yes, it will be messy, but it is messy fun to keep them healthy!

Yesterday, I made a paper ball pit out of some old boxes, old papers and plastic bags. It was something new and something sensory that she enjoyed. Apart from the sensory activity, we still continued her physical play and games. We noticed that she was happier, looking more contented. 
If you have very young kids, add something new and something sensory to their day to play and learn with! 
Keep young kids healthy by letting them explore with their senses to learn!

Take care,
