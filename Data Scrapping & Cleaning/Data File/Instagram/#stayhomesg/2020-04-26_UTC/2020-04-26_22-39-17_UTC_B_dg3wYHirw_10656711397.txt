So I didn't make it for the nationwide singing after I screamed and heard the police siren.ðŸ¥´ What a bummer. 
I decided to "compensate" with my own version - I'm also adding this to my virtual volunteering playlist so that patients can sing along together in time!

Releasing later when the sky turns bright.
Stay tuned.
