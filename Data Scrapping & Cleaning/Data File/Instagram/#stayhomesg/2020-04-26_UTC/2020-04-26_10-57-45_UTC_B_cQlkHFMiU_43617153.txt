Today I made a refreshing Thai vermicelli salad. Something sour and spicy! ðŸ˜‹ This is an easy to make dish.

Season and cook minced meat in a saucepan.
On another pot, boil water and cook 2 servings of vermicelli. When done, put it in a bowl of cold water to cool.

Slice 2-3 big limes into half and squeeze the juice in a small bowl. Add 8 tbsp of fish sauce. Mix well. Taste and add more fish sauce if needed.
