Replicate what my mum cooked few nights ago because i like sesame oil 😊 so here is my #麻油腰子 #stayhomesg .

*Recipe for my future reference*
Cut criss-cross on the kidney, make sure slices about twice of what u want as it will shrink, add boiling water to let the bloody water come out.

In a separate pot, sautee the ginger with sesame oil/normal oil (1:1) to infuse the flavour in the oil, remove ginger once golden. Add in stock and rice wine, seasoned with soy sauce n oyster sauce, add fungus and other ingredients u desired  e.g. meesua, egg.

Add in the boiled kidney, add in sesame oil and off fire once it boils. Garnish w the ginger n spring onion.
