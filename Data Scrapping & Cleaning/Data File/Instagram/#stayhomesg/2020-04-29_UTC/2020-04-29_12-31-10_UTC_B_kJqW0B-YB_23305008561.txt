Mother nature can be both elegant but savage at the same time. Like our favourite hornbills for example (Oriental Pied in picture), despite them being loved for their looks of looking friendly, do not forget of how their bills are also used as a weapon to prey on small animals when the need be. Infamous here for being opportunistic amd attacking caged pets here. While this might seem evil for some, it is all fair in the eyes of survival.

In view of #circuitbreakerapril , i've decided to share some photos to help get through these trying times. In each post, ill be sharing a favourite photo of a bird shot in #singapore and an interesting factoid i've observed.
