[SongHomeCafe] 𝐁𝐈𝐆 𝐁𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐊𝐅𝐀𝐒𝐓⁣

I've been having alot of fun making cafe-style dishes at home and this was the first thing I made! Super easy since the ingredients are all available in supermarkets! ⁣
⁣
Bratwurst with some back bacon, creamy scrambled eggs and a side of baby lettuce salad! ⁣
⁣
Coupled with the Yuzu Espresso Tonic that's perfect on hot days! Just out of curiosity, what cafe food do you miss the most?
