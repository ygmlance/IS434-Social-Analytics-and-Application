This stash made me wish I had unboxed my deliveries earlier! ðŸ˜‹

@sothyssingapore new Stretch Mask contains 3 high - tech plant extracts and a high performance 'spring effect' fabric to moisturise, brighten, increase skin elasticity for a lifting and rejuvenating effect! Use it weekly together with their daily Serum for best effects!

I remember @minon.sg for their super hydrating and effective masks and the new Clear Wash Powder is a welcomed edition to my family! It's the first enzyme facial powder cleanser that offer gentle cleansing for sensitive and dry skin. It gently unclog pores, removes old keratin and restore skin brightness. .
Staying home in this humid weather meant our air-conditioning is always on in the afternoon. So I'm glad to have a big tub of @belif_singapore The True Cream - Aqua Bomb infused with Aloe Vera extract that calms, soothes and increase skin's hydration levels by 70%! Love it for its lightweight refreshing feels and high efficacy ðŸ’§
