Korean Pancake Recipe 🇰🇷🤩
Annyeong~ Yes I was craving for korean pancakes since weeks ago but I couldn’t get my hands on any spring onions till yesterday, so the first thing I had to make was this pancake! I would say the flipping part requires abit more attention but all in all, I think it’s pretty simple. Try it out and show me!! 🥰🙆🏼‍♀️
