We will be closed on Monday 4 May, so the team will have the chance to rest and revive before going back to work on the second month of the circuit-breaker.

Don't worry, we will still be open on the actual day of Labour Day so you can enjoy our nasi lemak at the comfort of your home and loved ones ðŸ˜‰

Wishing everyone a safe and Happy Labour Day in advance!
