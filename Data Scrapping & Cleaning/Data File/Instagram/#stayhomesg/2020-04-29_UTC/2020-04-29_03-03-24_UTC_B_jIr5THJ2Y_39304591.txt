I don’t mind being copied especially when I have good stuff to share like this recent discovery ... @phyto.sg PHYTONOVATHRIX FORTIFYING ENERGIZING SHAMPOO. 💁🏻‍♀️ When you are as lazy as me and want wash-and-go hair this sulfate-free shampoo combined with the PHYTONOVATHRIX ENERGIZING HAIR MASS LOTION comes to the rescue. I don’t even need to style, blow dry or use products to get these natural waves! (Ok, maybe a quick brush but that’s it!) Swipe to see what my hair USED to look like a few years ago!! Simply frightful!! 😱 From now until end June, enjoy a 25% discount by simply name dropping this #promocode “cherylmiles” when purchasing online on both PHYTO website (www.phyto.sg) and  JOWAE website (www.jowae.sg)!!
