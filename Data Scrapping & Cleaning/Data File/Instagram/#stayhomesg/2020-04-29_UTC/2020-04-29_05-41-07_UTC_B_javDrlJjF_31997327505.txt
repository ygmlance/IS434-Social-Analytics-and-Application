Wednesday Stay Home Lunch - Homecooked Soya Bean Cakes and Bittergourd Stuffed with Spicy Minced Meat

This is different from Hakka or Ampang Yong Tau Foo.  I will say its more like a peranakan version with chilli powder, ground cumin, belachan, ground coriander, shallots and candlenuts going into seasoning the meat
