Fixer upper in progress! I mean cardbox home upper fixer. ⁣
⁣
Have been thinking of upgrading their “home” since it only could fit one of them comfortably. Decided to change up the old one while making a new one. ⁣
⁣
They have been building pillow/ blanket fortresses so I thought I might has well built a cardbox one, add some fairy lights and let them use it as  a reading nook for now. ⁣
Hopefully they will actually like it too. ⁣
⁣
It’s been quite fun, chaotic, frustrating and needless to say, messy all at the same time while trying to do it properly and involve the kids.⁣
