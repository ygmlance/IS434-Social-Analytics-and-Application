Dinner is Salmon Head Rice Soup. 三文鱼头泡饭
It’s very nutritious and all in one pot (nabe). I have done many nabe before so this round I did a twist. I added a little butter to my kombu bonito soup. And also added a slice of lemon in the rice soup. It tastes soooo good and appetising. 
Many friends have asked me what type of kombu or bonito that I used.  Kombu 昆布 is a type of seaweed that provides unami flavour in the soup; as for the white powdery natural salt on the strips, the more the better when you select. Don’t wash it away. This gives the unami. I bought my kombu and bonito from tsukiji market in Tokyo. But you can get it easily at our Japanese supermarket. I prefer 真昆布 as it tastes very clear and light sweet flavour and it’s the top range kombu. 日高昆布is commonly found in most stores and for soup for daily use. 
Bonito I like to use the thick tuna bonito flake because it has a smoky flavour. The last trip I went to tsukiji market I managed to get the owners to shave it on the spot. 
This rice soup I added carrots, cabbages, radish, mushrooms, tofu, clam, squid. And I added a salmon belly strip too. 🐟 
Seasonings have added sake, mirin, light soya sauce. All into one pot.
A great dinner indeed. (My girl wanted me to cook an egg dish so I did a simple steamed egg for her.).
