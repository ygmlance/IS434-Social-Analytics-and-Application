One week later. $28 mala takeaway.
-
I went a bit overboard with mala for todayâ€™s lunch, after not had it for more than a week. ðŸ˜… I just want to eat all the veggies! Added in my own home-made fried tempeh and more coriander before savoring it. ðŸ˜‹

Decided to go light and easy for dinner after. Cooked stir-fried beansprouts and stir-fried nai bai with tofu. Simple fuss free cooking, prepped and cooked within 30 minutes. This home-cooked dinner costs less than $5, fed my family of 5 people.

I will wait another week, before I go crazy for mala. Again. ðŸ˜„
