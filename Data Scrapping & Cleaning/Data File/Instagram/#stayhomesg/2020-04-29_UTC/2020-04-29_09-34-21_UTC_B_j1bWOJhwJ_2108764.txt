The older you get, you realize it isn’t about the material things, the pride or the ego. It’s about our hearts ❤️ and who they beat for. ✨#familyiseverything #stayhomesg

With the current situation now, I’m trying to take things a little slower, learning to put my phone 📱down and just be there. Be in the moment. A glass of rosé 🥂never hurts too 😉

I really like my Grocery Box Set A ($80) - which contains a delicious range of top-quality, convenient M&S staple products like pasta and pasta sauces through to breakfast options such as cereals, tea, as well as their best sellers like Malted Milk Biscuit & Dark Chocolate Digestives biscuits. The Nacho Cheese Tortilla chips were DELICIOUS! The kids kept asking for more! 😋
