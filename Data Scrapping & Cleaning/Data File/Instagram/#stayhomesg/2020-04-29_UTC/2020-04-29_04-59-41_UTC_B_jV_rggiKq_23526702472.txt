A well-designed kitchen does not just look good, but performs to the everyday lifestyle of its users.

For this kitchen, the Arclinea accessories and kitchen appliances were selected to support the user's requirements for coffee brewing, cooking, and entertaining. Key features of this kitchen include Arclinea's MAC unit, deep drawers, and appliances such as a hot/cold filtered water dispenser and integrated hob-hood.
