Day 23 of #circuitbreaker: What do you or ur kiddos usually eat for breakfast? We just tried Captain Instant Rolled Oats from @captainoats1965 😋 It comes in individual packs that are super convenient. Just open, add water & serve :) No need to cook! Add your favourite toppings for that extra taste! We added raisins! :) Healthy breakfast done in 15mins!⁣
