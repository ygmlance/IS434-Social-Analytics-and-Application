Moo moo cow mama for 19 months and counting 🐮🥛

I have been a breastfeeding mum for so long and my total breastfeeding journey is more than 5 years with my 3 kids. I’m a mama who is truly supporting breastfeeding because breastfeeding is all natural!
As a breastfeeding mum, maintaining a good milk supply is very important. Besides eating healthy & nutritious food and drinking plenty of water to maintain my milk supply, I can also enjoy tasty indulgence from @wonderfullmilk that will boost my milk production and to keep my sanity high as a SAHM of 3. It’s really nice to enjoy Dark Chocolate Lactation Cookies and Peanut Butter Lactation Cookies with a cup of hot Milo as my tea break. Mums deserve this, agree?

My fellow breastfeeding mums or mums who just want to enjoy tasty treats, do check out @wonderfullmilk I’m sure you will love their tasty lactation cookies as much as I do! I believe their tasty cookies work in boosting milk production, I don’t pump milk, I’m direct latching my toddler and I can feel more letdowns after consuming their lactation cookies with a cup of hot drink and drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Their cookies are egg free, made with organic ingredients and If you love granola, you gotta try their popular Blueberry Walnut Lactation Granola and Cranberry Raisin Lactation Muesli. Those are very healthy, full of delicious goodness and boosting milk production well.
