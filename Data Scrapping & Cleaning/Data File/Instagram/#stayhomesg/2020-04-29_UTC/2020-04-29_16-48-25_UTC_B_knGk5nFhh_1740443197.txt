Tonight's team night was hosted by @sharonhuang__ ! Had fun squeezing our brain juices to spot small differences between pictures and putting our observation skills to the test, guessing whose features belong to whom. Of course we have winners of the very interesting forfeit too, and we'll be posting them up tomorrow so do look forward to it! Special thanks to @nailenitselec for joining us ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— .
