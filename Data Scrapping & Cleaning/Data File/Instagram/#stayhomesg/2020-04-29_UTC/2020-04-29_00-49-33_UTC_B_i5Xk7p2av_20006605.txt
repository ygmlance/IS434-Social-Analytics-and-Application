Day 23 #thedailymarker30day23 colouring challenge. â€˜Thank Youâ€™ card. ðŸ˜Š
Time flies... my heartfelt thanks to @reverseconfetti for the opportunity to be a Guest Designer for March and April 2020. It has been a fulfilling and fun journey as I challenge myself to create many many cards. A BIG Thank you to all the Instagram friends and followers for your support too. 
For this card, I used the following @reverseconfetti products. The â€˜Butterfly Blossomsâ€™ stamp set and confetti cuts, â€™Circle Tagâ€™ & â€˜Thank Youâ€™ confetti cuts. Simply love this butterfly stamp.
