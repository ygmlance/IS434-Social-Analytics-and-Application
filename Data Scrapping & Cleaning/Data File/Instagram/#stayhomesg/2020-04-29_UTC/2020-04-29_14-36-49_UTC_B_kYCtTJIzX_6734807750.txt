They decided to have a drink together. Hugo sat next to Harley and carefully poured a tiny sip of water in the weaning glass for Harley and served the water in front of him, then waited patiently and silently for Harley to pick up the glass for a drink. Once or twice he gently place the glass on Harleyâ€™s lips to show him how it works ðŸ˜„ He then patiently wipe away the water on the table each time after Harley spilled the waterðŸ˜„I love observing them as individuals but there is a different kind of chemistry when they are together! #followingjoy #followthchild #montessoriwithmultiples #siblingslove #weaningbaby #weaningtable #weaningglass #growingupwithsiblings #lovegrowshere #graceandcourtesy #montessoribaby #montessoritoddler #montessoriathome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited
