In the morning of 29-Apr-2020, our P1 son who dreams for #smokefreeSG and started to prefer an organized study table, enjoyed a new #tabletStand cum #bookStand that he built using #LEGO (#LegoDuplo) last night to do his #homebasedlearning by #MOESingapore. To prevent his study from being interrupted by #secondhandsmoke, we could only shut all windows (#闭关修炼), switch on an air filter and a fan (#our123gratitude to teachers, @MOESingapore, electricity suppliers in Singapore and their staff who continue to work in this #covid19 pandemic). He was also thankful for the internet, a #secondhandIpad, his pencils, all tools that allow him to learn and interact with his teachers and friends. After today, there will be 2 more days of #HBL. He wishes all the best and jiayou to his friends, classmates, and all children in Singapore! Hope we all stay safe and enjoy an extraordinary #stayathome #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #schoolholiday starting from 5-May-2020. During previous holidays, we enjoyed riding buses and exploring Singapore; this year we have to be more creative than ever on how we can spend fun but meaningful holiday without leaving our #HDBSingapore home. Suggestions are welcome :) #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg
