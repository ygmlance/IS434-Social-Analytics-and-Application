[What exactly are meaningful conversations with our children?] Aren't all conversations with our children meaningful? Well yes and no, conversations with our children in general helps us obtain information from them and teaches them things but meaningful conversations are more than just an exchange of words, they are conversations that leave us feeling like something inside us has changed, something has been learnt and we walk away from it knowing that there is a deeper connection to our children.

Meaningful conversations are conversations that allows for us and our children to
❤️ reflect on our actions
❤️ reminisce memories
❤️ articulate thought process and emotions
❤️ gain insights to decision making
❤️ discuss about current affairs (or situations around us) and application of its learning points to self and others
❤️ reveal our vulnerable feelings to each other

Meaningful conversations do strengthen bonds between parent and child but they don't happen naturally unless we are intentional and mindful to encourage them in our homes.

What do you think? How do you have meaningful conversations with your children?
