Day 23 of Circuit breaker.
Having bread for lunch can be healthy and nutritious too.
The best part is no wastage here.
With left over canned mushrooms soup , i added in tomatoes and tofu. Fried omelette for the extra proteins.
And of course healthy Low GI soft grain bread from Gardenia. Crispy and toasted with a mini griddle pan.
Finally Bananas for desserts for extra fiber.
