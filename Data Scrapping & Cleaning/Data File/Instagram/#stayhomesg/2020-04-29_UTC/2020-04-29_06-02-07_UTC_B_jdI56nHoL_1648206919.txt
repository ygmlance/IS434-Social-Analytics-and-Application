Congratulations ! We’re past the 3 week mark. Am sure that everyone is getting used to the new normal, but that doesn’t stop us from counting down.

When we embarked on this project of changing the menu, and our entire workflow, a lot of us questioned if it was the right move to make.

Amidst the uncertainty, we persevered and stuck to our guns. It was something that had to be done.

And here we are, after 2 weeks of a mini struggle, and lots of support from friends and family - still alive, and better equipped to survive this.

A big thank you to all of you out there, that supported us, in spirit or in delivery orders. Also, to our riders/drivers that go back and forth, to send the food. It’s a team effort. .
