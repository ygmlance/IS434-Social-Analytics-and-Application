Day 23 of circuit breaker, I try to involve Leodys with our daily chores and become my little helper. He will now help me to carry my laundry basket to the washing machine and take out clothes for me. After that, he will help me to bring back the basket and put at the original place. To me it is important to expose him to our daily lifestyle and learn life time skill. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #littlehelper #homebasedlearning #hbl #lifetimeskills #laundryhelper #wfh #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
