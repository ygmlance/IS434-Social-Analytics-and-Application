#day23 of #circuitbreakersg : yesterday i was feeling low energy despite of sufficient sleep so today i came back with a vegence; making ondeh ondeh for snacks and seafood tom yum soup for dinner
.
And i also ordered #tutukueh for the kids and they love it! They didnt show that much of enthusiasm when we bought at pasar malam, i guess they must be feeling quite deprived of snacks ðŸ˜‚
