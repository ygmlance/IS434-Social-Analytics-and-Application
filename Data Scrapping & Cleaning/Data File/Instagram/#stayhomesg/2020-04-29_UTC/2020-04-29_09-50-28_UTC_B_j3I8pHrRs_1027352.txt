@regentsingapore is a hotel with more than its fair share of F&B establishments that are independently famous, and over the years, a couple have even picked up awards and accolades. During this Circuit Breaker, a few have come together to offer their food and beverages so guests can #TakeRegentHome.
Compiled into a comprehensive ‚ÄúGourmet Meals To Go‚Äù Menu (delivery and self-collection are available), the choices range from simple dishes for a quick bite, to lavish Set Meals like the Basilico Brunch-To-Go ($588.79) that can feed a family of 8 to 10, to customising your own platters. No gastronomic need is left wanting. Just click on the link in @regentsingapore‚Äôs bio to order.
Thanks to @maria_hannah, Director of Communications and P.R. at #RegentSingapore who kindly sent a selection my way today, this is what I had:

1. From #BasilicoSG, the Italian Restaurant that always required early reservations to secure a table for their popular buffets, came a blob of Putignano Burrata served with Heirloom Tomatoes, and a large and very fragrant Focaccina con Tartufo Nero e Robiola ($29.91). The oven-baked foccacia was spread with Summer Truffle and soft-ripened Robiola Cheese. It‚Äôs really good piping hot, so just do what I did - reheat it in the oven when you want to eat.
2. From Chinese Executive Chef @liu.c.hai.1 at One MICHELIN Starred #SummerPalaceSG, I had Diced Beef with Asparagus and Black Pepper Sauce, and a masterfully executed Fried Rice with Scallops, Lobster and X.O. Sauce. I‚Äòve always enjoyed the food here and felt the latter traveled very well.
3. The Strawberry Shortcake (or Strawberry Torte) at #DolcettoByBasilico by Executive Pastry Chef @_alex_chong has long been a favourite of mine, so I was thrilled to see a whole cake included for dessert. For me, what elevates the fluffy vanilla sponge with light-as-air cream and strawberries is the crunchy toasted almonds coating the sides. 
4. Packed with the food was a mini whisky cocktail from @manhattan_sg, the bar ranked no. 2 on #Asias50Best and no. 11 on the #worlds50best. I took it as a sign that daytime drinking was allowed üòÅ. Thank you Maria, Executive Chef @angelo__ciccone & Team Regent.
