It's been a long time since I really had time to self practice and this is precisely why I'm so grateful for the extra time at home to revisit all that I've not worked on! 
As you can see, #eaglelegs - not a favourite - I've always been working on hip mobility but running/long distance running always brings me back to point 1 all over again LOL. And at the end was a cheat ðŸ¤ª video sped up 2x~
Inspired by @veektoriaa and @situ_kh_world to come back to finding my #handstand too and here's me struggling to float my L shape without trying to lean on Paul the wall.
