So happy to still be able to get my favourite foods while staying home! The popiah and mee siam from @qijisg are my comfort foods. We also ordered nasi lemak to keep for tomorrowâ€™s lunch ðŸ™Š is anyone else doing this for this period? Makes your delivery fee more worth it and saves some effort doing meal planning! -S
