Okay SO GUYS I don't expect I'm gonna trigger another buying frenzy with this post (hopefully), so if you go to a sufficiently large 'Fairprice Xtra' in the near-to-immediate future, keep a lookout for this adjustable easel if you wanna draw at home in relative comfort. The promo price at the time we encountered it was SG$9.90 - but surprisingly enough the build is reasonably good! ðŸ˜—
