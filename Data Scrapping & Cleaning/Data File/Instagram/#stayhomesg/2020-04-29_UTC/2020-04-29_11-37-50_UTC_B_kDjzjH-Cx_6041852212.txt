No chicken meals still.

Didn't decide what to cook. 
Only took minced pork out to thaw and didn't know what to cook.

Asked my hub what he wants and he tell me meatballs. So we have meatballs again today. This time with hidden carrots and shallots.

Stir fried some cabbage and mushroom to go along. Surprisingly, my boy loves the cabbage dish.

Nice surprise for an unplanned meal
