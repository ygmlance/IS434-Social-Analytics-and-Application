When the hub misses his mother-in-law's Bee Tai Mak so much that he's willing to make a trip to the supermarket late last night...left me no excuse not to cook 😅

So, here's my 20-min fried Bee Tai Mak!

50-60g minced pork
400g bee tai bak (rat noodles)
1 small carrot
A handful cabbage
1 clove garlic
1 knob of ginger (same size as garlic)
2 sprigs of spring onions
2 tbsp oil
2 eggs
200ml water (for cooking)

Pork marinade:
½ tsp cornstarch, ¼ tsp salt, ¼ tsp sugar, ½ tsp light soy, ½ tsp sesame oil

Seasoning:
¾ tsp salt, 1½ tsp light soy

1. Marinate pork. Soak Bee Tai Mak in boiling hot water.
2. Julienne carrot. Cut cabbage into bite size. Cut spring onion into 5cm lengths, separate greens and whites. Smash ginger and garlic with knife.
3. Put white parts of spring onion, ginger, garlic and oil into a frying pan. Start on low heat, fry till fragrant and aromatic starts browning.
4. Turn to high heat. Add in carrot and cabbage, season with ¼ tsp salt. Fry till slightly wilted. Add in pork, continue frying till pork almost cooked.
5. Add in Bee Tai Mak, remaining seasoning, give a mix, add water. Bring back to boil.
6. Add in eggs, swirl around, off fire, sprinkle on green parts of spring onion. Dish up and serve.
