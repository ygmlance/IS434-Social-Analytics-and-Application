‚Å£KFC- Korean fried cauliflower made with an instant tempura batter from @oki.singapore. I try not to deep fry at home so this felt like such a treat. The sauce is the same base I used for the Korean fried chicken I made in Italy! I don't like my savory foods to be sweet so I omit the sugar they usually goes into the sauce ‚†Ä
