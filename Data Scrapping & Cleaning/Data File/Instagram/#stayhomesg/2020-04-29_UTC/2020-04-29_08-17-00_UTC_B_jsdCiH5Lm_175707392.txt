Got inspired to do these 
Face Mask craft for the kids! 
After the CB ends not sure if they will need to wear their surgical mask to school whole day!
 I think practising wearing mask now and teaching them proper steps to keep away when eating/drinking disposing does help when times come. 
These mask can be easily made with materials we have at home. We used @offspringsingapore wet wipes! 
Try it! You can use kitchen towels too!
