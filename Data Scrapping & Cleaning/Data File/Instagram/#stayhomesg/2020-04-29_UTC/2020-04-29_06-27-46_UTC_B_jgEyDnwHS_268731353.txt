Needed more space to store groceries, so we ordered an extra fridge.
Fridge Review: 
1) Energy efficiency: excellent, requires no electricity at all.
2) Features: 2 functional doors, 4 internal shelves. Great for keeping plastic toy food fresh despite doors being ajar, extensive tests shows plastic ice cream did not melt.
3) Price: $0. Very affordable for a designer fridge, also thanks to child workforce.
4) Design: a little psychedelic, artists were clearly high (on sugar).
5) Winning feature: Versatility - fridge can transform into a closet or home for soft toys.
.
Verdict: highly recommended. Note that the artists need creative expression so expect them to be same colour as fridge. #stayhomesg #CircuitBreaker
