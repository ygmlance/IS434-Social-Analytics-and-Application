Pineapple Fried Rice🍍🍚
.
🍴Overall ease: 7/10
.
🛒Ingredients: pineapple, egg, shrimp, onions, capsicum, mixed spices (tumeric, cumin, mustard powder, coriander etc), raisins, fresh coriander
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: stir fry the shrimp, set aside. Stir fry the egg till scrambled, add the cooked rice, add back in the ingredients + seasonings and spices, and fry till satisfied!
.
😋Taste: 6/10. Perhaps our least successful dish in the past month. The flavour was there, but the rice was simply too wet. On hindsight, should have used overnight rice, or only fold the rice in at the end, after the ingredients have been fried till dry. Definitely will try and improve in the future! P.S. the cocktail on the side - two different gins, lemon juice, tonic water - was sick tho.
