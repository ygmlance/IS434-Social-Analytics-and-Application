My unsuccessful Korean dish of Seolleongtang (Korean milky beef bone soup) became Korean Muguk (beef radish soup). Or actually I dunno what it became. I pressure cooked the beef bones for a long time but it didnâ€™t turn milky at all. So I decided it was good enough because the bone marrow was already hollow. The beef was soft and tender and the beef balls from Hubers were very good tasting. The kimchi is store bought. Those I made were a bit too salty so itâ€™s back to the drawing board. ðŸ˜… they will be used to make kimchi soup.. ðŸ˜… a good meal of rice with tender beef slices in beef broth. ðŸ˜Š#cookingexperiments #stayhomesg
