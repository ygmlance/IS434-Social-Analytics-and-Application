The school holidays are around the corner and so is May the 4th!

This Circuit Breaker will not stop us from celebrating Star Wars Day and so we'd like to invite parents and children to participate in our exciting activities the next few weeks!

We'll be organizing activities that you can take part in, all from the comfort and safety of your home!

Watch this space the next few days as we announce more details on the activities and how you can also stand a chance to win prizes!
