Everyone has a dream in some sense. More often than not, we forget that we are capable of reaching them; simply because it is so much more comfortable to take things the easy way. We end up in a circular road of discontentment, unhappiness and frustration. When I first received this gift, I wondered what my dreams are. As time goes by, I realised that we can focus on our tiny dreams rather than trying to come up with a grandiose one. Starting a tiny dream of mine today and there are many people to thank for. @ada.chia is one of them who always encourages me, and gives me gifts like this to motivate me further. 
Now, think about what your dreams are and how you can start reaching for them. Do you also have tiny dreams that you didnâ€™t think count as a dream? ðŸ¥°
