Feeling loved for so many reasons, but being the foodie that I am, being fed awesome food is definitely an important one ü§£
.
A couple of days ago, I tasted my first a√ßai bowl at work, and fell in love! It was a buckini bowl (swipe for see) from @theacaicollective, sponsored by @snackboxdiaries, and organised by @drjadekua (hmmmm apparently cannot post photos at work so I post my illustrations, can? üòÇ).

Thank you Clare and @c0rde for your support for frontliners, and thank you Dr Jade for looking out for your juniors. Go show them some love! ‚ù§Ô∏è

If a√ßai bowls are your thing, go to my stories for a wallpaper you can screenshoot! ü•∞ .
Also, we NEED an a√ßai bowl emoji, no??? ü§£‚ù§Ô∏è

Stay strong and stay safe, my dears! ‚ù§Ô∏è
