**COPYWRITING IS A LOT LIKE FIXING YOUR CAR.** You can learn to do it yourself. Or not. Weâ€™re going to give you all the tips and tricks you need to get off to a running start, and then some if you do want to DIY. But be patient, itâ€™s going to take a lot of time to practice, and even more to master it. (Contrary to what those sleazy â€˜copywritingâ€™ coaches say - there is no quick fix or template to increase your sales magically by 90000x)

Or you could get a professional to do it for you. After all - do you really want to experiment on something that expensive? Also, saving you the time to do other more important entrepreneur-y things.

But still, itâ€™s essential to know about copywriting and communications. So you know about the various parts that make it what it is - and to know that youâ€™re getting what youâ€™re paying for! 
Follow our page @everyonecreativeco or #CopyByEveryone for a detailed step-by-step look at what makes great communications and turns organisations into great communicators. âœ¨Starting tomorrow!âœ¨ The best bit? Thereâ€™s no huge bill at the end of it all.
