Some slice of life in Singapore ~  two uncles playing checker under our HDB void deck 🏬. At the wet market, you see a seafood stall 🦐🐙🐟 called "Ah Cham Fish Stall" with abysmal business, while the "Ah Seng Fruits Stall" 🍎🍌🍍 had gone digital 💪. In fact, Ah Seng need not be present at the stall 🍎🍌🍍. He just need to reply emails, pack the orders and coordinate the delivery.

After the Covid, many businesses, big or small will go digital 😎 Those who choose to go on with their traditional way of doing businesses will see them lagging behind in time to come 😶

How many cats 🐱 have you seen so far? 😉
