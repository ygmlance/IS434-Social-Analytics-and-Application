LOL just kidding.

I am NOT a movement guru and do not preach about movements all the time. However, they are so useful and this is an example of real life mobility practice you can incorporate into your lifestyle. Functional movements are practical and essential to our daily livelihood but humans do not use them or not sure how to use them safely and functionally. If you are training heavy and I mean heavy, are you incorporating any mobility training?

If you are in the gym training a limited number of patterns over and over again and call it functional training I am sorry to tell you it is not.

Protect your fascia. Protect your joints. Get some real mobility practice for real.
