[A less-waste 🌱diversion from soaps] 
Suffering from the withdrawal symptoms - not from no BBT but from not being able to make soap 🧼 during this #circuitbreaker period.

So where can the creative energy flow?Baking! Please indulge me as I share a few #lesswaste tips for amateur bakers like myself. Experienced bakers 👩‍🍳👨‍🍳 pls be kind. 🤭😋

I'm no veteran baker, but I've done enough to gather experiences from many mistakes....and successes. So here's a candid list triggered by my no-knead bread🍞.
.
🥚A flatlay always looks good. And that's how I used to prepare baking ingredients...going down the recipe, one ingredient in one bowl, just like in the cooking shows where everything is prepared in advance. But what does that mean? 20 bowls to wash after the baking is done. 😓So what I've learnt? Study the recipe beforehand then tare it, top it up, and just combine the ingredients in consecutive steps together if possible. Or just leave them in the measuring cup! 👍
.
🥚Don't preheat the oven as the first step. UNLESS all the preparation work takes less than 10 minutes to complete. I've no idea how many times my oven has completed preheating and is just sitting wasting energy while I frantically get all the steps beforehand done. As you perfect the recipe, jot down which is a good point to preheat the oven . Don't trust your memory.
.
🥚In the process of looking for a wooden spoon in the kitchen, we found a brand new pack of wooden utensils that everybody denied buying....which means it was probably me. 😬Learning? Don't get all excited about buying new utensils after watching a Youtube video or learning a new recipe then chuck them into the cupboard and forget about them. Use what you have first, and if you buy, put it out to use, don't chuck into the cupboard.
.
🥚There was no expiry date on my packet of yeast. Tested it and no it didn't froth like the recipe said it would in 5 minutes. Would have thrown it out and gave up on this baking but MIL says old folks put it under the ☀️ . No harm right so that's what we did....and it frothed beautifully!! So regardless what the expiry or recipe says, test it out yourself.

Do you identify with any?
