Happy Hump Day! Itâ€™s end of April already... time flies...
Iâ€™m serving the popular street food for lunch - Roti John. ðŸ¥– 
I used minced beef instead of mutton. Itâ€™s a sandwich with minced  beef, onions, eggs and sambal plated on a fairly soft baguette bread and cooked on a pan. Thereâ€™s a chilli-tomato sauce mixture as a dipping sauce. 
My girl loves it very much. 
This is another meal for lunch.
