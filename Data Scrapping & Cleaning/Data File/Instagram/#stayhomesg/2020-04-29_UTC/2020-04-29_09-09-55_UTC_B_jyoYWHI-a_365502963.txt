üçû Fluffy Soft Pumpkin Bread
(Can even do yoga better than you!) üò±
Since I have some leftover pumpkin, I decided to turn it into a loaf bread. The result is simply stunning!
I will create a video when I'm free but meanwhile here's the recipe.

Ingredients:
For Dough:
350 grams of bread flour
2 tbsp of milk powder
4.5 grams or 1 ¬Ω tsp of instant yeast
2 tbsp of fine sugar
1/4 tsp of salt
175 ml of water
40 grams of softened salted butter
100 grams of pumpkin, mashed.

Egg wash:
1 egg

Instructions
Steam pumpkin until soft and mash them with a fork.
Put all of the ingredients into a breadmaker starting from the wet ingredients. You could also use a stand mixer with a dough attachment instead.
Knead the dough using the breadmaker for about 25 minutes. It will take about 15 minutes if you are using a stand mixer.
Let it proof for an hour until it triples in volume.
Then divide the dough into 2 equal portions on a lightly floured surface. Roll them into 2 long strips. Then braid them together accordingly.
Transfer into a greased bread tin and let it proof in a warm environment for about 50 minutes until it reaches 80% of the pan while you preheat your oven to 180C. 
Brush the top of the dough with some egg wash and bake it in the oven for about 25 to 30 minutes.
Once baked, let it cool for about 5 minutes before carefully unmould the bread to cool further over a wire rack with a piece of cloth covering lightly.
Once it is fully cooled, use a bread knife or an electric knife to slice the bread neatly in an orderly manner. Then wrap it up with a plastic wrap to store the bread.
