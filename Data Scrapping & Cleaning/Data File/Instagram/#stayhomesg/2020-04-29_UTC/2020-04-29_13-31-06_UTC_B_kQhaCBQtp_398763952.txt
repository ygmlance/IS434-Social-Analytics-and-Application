Throwback to a wedding performance in April 2013😍 Wow 7 years agooo?? This Circuit breaker really making alot of us miss playing gamelan together, especially now in Singapore we can’t have gathering in the mean time. Times are hard, may we be blessed this Ramadan. Cannot wait to meet up with the team and have dinner together..❤️
