NTU first virtual Admin Town Hall with Senior Vice President (Administration) and her team sharing some essential updates. I’m really appreciative of Aik Na’s team who has worked tirelessly in the last 97 days. It has not been an easy task for her team. They might not have all the answers. Not everyone may understand their decisions. Some might even feel more can be done. But one thing I’m sure is, the team has done more than beyond to ensure the best possible arrangement to keep everybody safe. I’m thankful for a team that’s passionate and committed to give beyond during a time such as this. THANK YOU. 29 Apr 2020. #NTUSG #StayHome #StayHomeSG #StayHomeforSG #NTUCEE #CEE #NTU
