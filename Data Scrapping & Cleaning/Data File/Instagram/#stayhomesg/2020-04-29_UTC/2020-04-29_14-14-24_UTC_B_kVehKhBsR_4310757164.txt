Day23 of #circuitbreakersg : Conflicting thoughts about either I love working from home or I miss working from office situation 🤔. Though Everyday seems very busy and productive working from home 🏠 still I do miss the work office space environment. But I love being home sitting next to my Husband, sharing the desk space, Having a meaningful talks in between work feels so different yet Love it thus conflicts 😝. This pic is taken at ofc cafeteria the time I enjoy every sip of my #blackcoffee 😇. As I’m totally deep driven into work mode, prepared very simple comforting lunch 🍴but Super yummy vegetable and good fats rich #dinner (typical me)🤪. 🌷
