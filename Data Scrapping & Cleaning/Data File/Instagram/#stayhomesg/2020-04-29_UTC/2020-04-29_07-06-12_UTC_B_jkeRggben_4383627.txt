Today I'm grateful for a healthy body; for waking up in my comfortable bed; for my abilities to dance, to walk, to smell the rain and taste the food I ordered which was delivered contactless to my door. I'm grateful I get to drink my ketones daily🍹, and have the ability to choose what flavours I want every morning. I know there are people who didn't even get to wake up today.

I'm so thankful for family members 💑👪👨‍👩‍👦👨‍👨‍👧‍👧👫 who are well and healthy, and who remain in positive spirits and are in harmony with one another, who talk, chat on group chats, watch tv and laugh together. I hear neighbours who fight with their families every day during this stay home period.

I'm grateful for having a working internet connection 🌐 and at least one device that allows me to connect with friends on multiple platforms, work my cloud-based business online and get paid every single week, and buy ebooks to improve myself. I'm grateful for the resources I have. I know there are those who would die to even own a mobile device and WiFi.

I'm grateful that I get to post this, that I have fingers and hands that are working, to write this, and I'm grateful for those of you who take time to read the stuff I write. I know there are people who live in the shadows and try very hard to get even one person to notice them or listen to what they say.

I'm grateful for you, who has the intellect and honours social responsibility to stay home and help protect everyone's family members so we can soon go out and enjoy the things and freedom we used to take for granted.

Thank you. You, and the little things in life we never used to pay attention to - thank you. ❤️
