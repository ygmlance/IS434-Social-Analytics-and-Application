We are coming to the end of HBL!!! ðŸ¥³. This was my first photo on the first day of HBL at 8am zzzzzzzz. .
Iâ€™m proud to share my original plan here (swipe) and report that NOTHING went according to plan ðŸ˜‚.
.
Swipe to see my daily workspace of nearly 12 hours a day...my kidsâ€™ room. I would do a workout while they have breakfast at ermmmm 10.30am? Then itâ€™s HBL time and we would end up with a late lunch and yup, late dinner, and late bedtimes ðŸ˜…. .
How are you all doing? Are you still keeping your kids to their usual bed time?.
