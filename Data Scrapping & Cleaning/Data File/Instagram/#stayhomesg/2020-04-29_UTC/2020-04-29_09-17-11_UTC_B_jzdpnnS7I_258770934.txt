Dinner on day 23/56. My house is filled with the aroma of sesame oil. 4 dishes today. Clearing the fridge leaving some for tomorrow because donâ€™t intend to cook during the long weekend ðŸ™ƒ #liuzaicook #instafood #sgfood #sgfooddiary #sgeats #sgmakan #homecookedmeal #stayhomesg #sesameoilchicken #onionegg
