I have been receiving many parents and student's feedback about how useful they think the Music History Online Camp was. Some students even asked me if there is anymore... Are you falling in love to music history?

I'm motivated by how successful the online lesson especially during this circuit breaker. Thanks to the technology today, we can continue to learn without disruption.

I've decided to do continue for 𝕸𝖚𝖘𝖎𝖈 𝕳𝖎𝖘𝖙𝖔𝖗𝖞 𝕺𝖓𝖑𝖎𝖓𝖊 𝕮𝖆𝖒𝖕 Part 2... Mark your 📅 Calendar down!

2/5/2020 Saturday 
Group 1: 1-2pm (6-9 years old)
Group 2: 2.30-3.30pm (10 years old and above)

See you in ZOOM ! ! ! •
