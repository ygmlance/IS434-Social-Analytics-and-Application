What i miss during this #covid19 period or #CBtime is this,  a nice sit down meal in a relaxing environment and enjoying the craftmanship and creativity of the #chef. No rush own time own target. Always love this wonderful meal at #cornerhouse. Excellent experience. So missing it.  Cant wait to get out and dash for it, a nice proper sit down dine in meal .
