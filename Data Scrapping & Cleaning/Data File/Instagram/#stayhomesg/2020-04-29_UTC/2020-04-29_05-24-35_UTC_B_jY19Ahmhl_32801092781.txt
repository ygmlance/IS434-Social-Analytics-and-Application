Circuit breaker Day 23: Lunch from @matchayasg 👍👍👍 Honestly was not expecting much since it’s like a matcha drinks store, but the Tokyo beef short ribs were soooo delicious! Generous portion of meat + good ratio of sauce to rice. Japanese chicken katsu curry was not bad (though obviously the katsu isn’t crispy by the time it’s delivered). Ordered because they have this buy 4 free 1 mains promo, added 2 drinks to hit the min. $60 spend. Total bill came up to $62. Not a matcha/hojicha connoisseur but I think it was pretty good, more tea than milk which is great!
