Never mind that I cannot visit my fav cafes these few weeks. I recreated my own “ cafe “ at home😁
.
I got these huge loaves of sourdough bread ( $7.40- $8.40) from @breadyboys . Sliced them up and added my own favourite breakfast must haves such as tuna, avocado, eggs and cheese.  While you are carting these welcoming loaves , make sure you add the Smoked French Butter( $9.90)  in your cart.

I kept going back to my fridge for more of the butter 😆. Best eaten with a slice of toasted Original rustic round sourdough. For those who prefer some sweetness and crunch , I would say get the Cranberry & Walnut loaf.
