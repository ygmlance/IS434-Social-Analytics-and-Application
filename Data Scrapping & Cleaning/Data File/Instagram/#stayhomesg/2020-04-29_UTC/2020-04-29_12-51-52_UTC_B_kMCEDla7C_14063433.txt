FaceTiming shoot with @paolatambunann !!!!! Shooting in face time can be pretty hard because the phone might not focus properly and you canâ€™t tap to focus. But it certainly trains one to direct their model or friends easier. And also your friends will probably know how to shoot by themselves with a tripod afterwards ðŸ˜‚

Photos are taken via FaceTiming live shoot
