Tang Hoon
One of my favourite noodles, Tang Hoon or also called Bean Vermicelli Noodles / Glass Noodles. It will basically soaks up any sauce and makes the noodles super flavourful. Cooking everything in a pot makes a quick fuss free meal! For this you can add any ingredients as you desired.

Seasoning:
Mix oyster sauce, light & dark soy sauce, salt, sugar and white pepper in a bowl first.

• Soak the Tang Hoon with warm water
• Heat wok with oil, add minced garlic and fry until fragrant.
• Add in sliced pork and louts roots, stir fried briefly then add in prawns.
• Remove the prawns once it is abt 80% cooked.
• Add in Tang Hoon, seasoning and water/stock that enough to cover half of it, allow it to simmer. • Add vegetables and prawns back to cook, simmer untils the sauce dried up and it's ready to serve.
