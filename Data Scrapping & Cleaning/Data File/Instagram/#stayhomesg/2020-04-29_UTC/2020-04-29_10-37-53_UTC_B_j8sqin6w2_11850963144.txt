Today I cooked... kimchi fried rice ðŸ¤¤ FAST and SIMPLE - recipe below. Super motivated to cook more this period â€˜cause every home-cooked meal/bake post means USD10 being donated to @savethechildren â€˜s global food security programs. Support this brilliant initiative by @ascott_ltd if you can!! âœ¨ #NOTSPONSORED

RECIPE for one: (1) Slice garlic into ultra thin pieces - like garlic chips! (2) Add oil into your heated pan. Throw in the garlic and fry till crisp. (3) Crack an egg into the pan, then pour in the rice - I used leftover white rice thatâ€™s just enough for one. Stir-fry them together. (4) Add 1 tablespoon of sesame oil + 1 tablespoon of light soya sauce. (5) Add in kimchi (~1/4 a rice bowl) and stir-fry over big fire ðŸ”¥

What Iâ€™m missing at home are onions to stir-fry and spring onions to garnish. You can also add bacon/ham/enoki shrooms and stir-fry them at the start if you wish! Thanks @8days_eat for the inspiration ðŸ˜‹
