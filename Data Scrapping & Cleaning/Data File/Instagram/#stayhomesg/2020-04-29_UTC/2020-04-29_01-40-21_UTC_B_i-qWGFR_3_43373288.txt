For the very first time in our nine-year history, current events have prevented us from heading out to photograph and interview people on the street—so we’re putting the camera in the hands of our very own Shentonistas. Starting this week, we bring you #MadeByShentonistas: a new segment where our Shentonistas share some useful tips, impart their knowledge, or just share something fun to try out as we #stayhome.
In our first episode, meet @dohkanlinh56, a hairstylist at @itto_lim. Impressions still matter, even though interactions take place online rather than in person, and if you’re in need of a quick, fuss-free hairstyle to tame your mane before your next online meeting, watch and learn.
