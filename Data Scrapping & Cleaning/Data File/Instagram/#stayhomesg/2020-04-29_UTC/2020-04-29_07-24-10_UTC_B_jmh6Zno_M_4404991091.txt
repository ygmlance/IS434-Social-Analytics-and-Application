Greetings from the Heart of Singapore.⁣
⁣
On behalf of all the team, we send our very best wishes to you all and trust you are safe and well. We are living through our extended “circuit breaker” in Singapore right now, where all non essential businesses are closed until 1st June. Thankfully, we are considered an essential service and can still have the opportunity to serve those who are experiencing these tumultuous times away from their country, and extend a second home to them.⁣
⁣
It is a little quieter than usual here at Carlton City, without the symphony of voices and flurry of activity that we have been used to on a daily basis. In our bid to stop the spread of the virus, we have closed our recreational facilities and some food outlets; however, we know that this is only temporary. Because tough times simply do not last, and we have faith that we will.⁣
⁣
We will thus stand strong and continue to take utmost care of all our guests and employees the best we can. The world may have closed borders, but our arms and doors remain open.⁣
⁣
To do so at the safety of both our guests and staff, all team members undergo temperature screenings everyday and wear face masks both in and outside of work. All areas of the hotel are also regularly cleaned to the highest standards, with extra attention paid to high touch areas such as door handles and lift buttons.⁣
⁣
At Carlton City, we understand that there is no real instruction manual in handling a period as unsure as this; but we believe that by coming together, all of us can soon usher in a new era of travels again. When that happens, you can expect to receive the same excellent service and attention to detail as you always have with us.⁣
⁣
We count the days towards the one where we can finally look up with a smile and say, “Welcome back to Carlton City Hotel.".⁣
⁣
⁣
Yours sincerely,⁣

General Manager of Carlton City Hotel Singapore⁣
