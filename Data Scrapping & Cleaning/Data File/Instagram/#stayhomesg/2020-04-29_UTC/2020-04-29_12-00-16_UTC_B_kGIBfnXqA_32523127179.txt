😋Taste: 7/10. Matcha anko  is usually a match made in heaven. However, the matcha taste wasn’t as strong as the last batch and had a slightly bitter aftertaste (used a different brand of matcha). The anko provided an added textural dimension and sweetness, but it also made the bread denser. We tried a new technique - lamination - so perhaps our lack of skill contributed to the dense crumb structure. Overall still tasty, but there’s definitely room for improvement!
