Cat/Cow Pose is a wonderful way to warm up the spine in the morning or at any point on or off your mat.

There are many 𝙥𝙝𝙮𝙨𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙡 𝙗𝙚𝙣𝙚𝙛𝙞𝙩𝙨 of Cat/Cow Pose, including toning the gastrointestinal tract and female reproductive system. The asana flow helps relieve stress from menstrual cramps, lower back pain, and sciatica. Cat/Cow Pose increases flexibility of the neck, shoulders, and spine. The movement also stretches the muscles of the hips, back, abdomen, chest, and lungs.

Cat Stretch held at its peak releases tension of the upper back and neck. Activation of the tailbone emphasizes the root movement of the spine, which increases flexibility for forward and backbends.

Additionally, the spine consists of both primary (thoracic and sacral) and secondary (cervical and lumbar) curves. Inhaling in spinal flexion (Cow Tilt) increases the primary spinal curves and decreases the secondary spinal curves. Exhaling in spinal extension (Cat Stretch) increases the secondary curves and decreases the primary curves.

Cat/Cow Pose strengthens and improves flexibility of the spine through utilization of the reciprocal relationship between the primary and secondary curves.
