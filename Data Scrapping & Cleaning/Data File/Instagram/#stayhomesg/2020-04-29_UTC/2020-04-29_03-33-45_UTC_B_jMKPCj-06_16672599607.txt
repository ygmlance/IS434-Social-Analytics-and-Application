Breaking Circuit D23...
Can't visit the Gastropub, so Gastropod... ðŸ¤” is visiting us. Pinky the gen(i)us Plectopylis from Terrestris, probably not searching for the Brain, is our new pet. Narf. He likes his aqua though. He does not like Nai Bai...and apparantly is safe here @ Balconia. Almost a week now. Exploring. Pinky probably knows he is to small too end up dressed in parsley in my escargotiÃ¨re.
