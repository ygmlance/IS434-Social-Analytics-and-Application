#CircuitBreaker Day23

We have seen quite a few posting of these so we decided to place an order for ourselves too. Frozen, freshly chilled dim sum delivery directly from Swatow Restaurant! They served authentic Teochew food and Dim Sum, all time famous for its freshness and fine quality. Feels great to be able to order their frozen dim sum and it’s so simple, just steam it up and ta-dang it’s ready to be serve!
