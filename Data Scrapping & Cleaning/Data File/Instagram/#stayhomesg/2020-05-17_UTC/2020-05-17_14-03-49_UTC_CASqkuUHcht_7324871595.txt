Hello lovely people! 🥰 I am opening another preorder for my DIY embroidery kits (sunflower and lavender pouch)! I believe anyone can make this. There are both PDF and video instructions, and I made them ultra easy to understand for beginners! 🤗 They will be ready in June, so do purchase if you are comfortable with it. Take note that these kits will not be available for some time after this preorder as I want to take a break from packing 😂 You can preorder them from my website (please pay by offline payment, Paynow)! ❤️

Thank you for all the love for these kits. I don’t think I’ve packed so intensely in my whole life 🤣
