A Special CCB Presentation: Homecoming

During this period of difficulty for many, even darkness for some, we hope our music can provide some comfort and light.

Do join us in our special 2-week release of Homecoming, Sing! Men’s Chorus’s annual concert held at Victoria Concert Hall, Singapore, on 4 November, 2018. Watch the performance at our bio link or go to our YouTube channel.

After trekking through Western repertoires for more than 10 years, Sing! Men’s Chorus delved into its first all-Asian concert in 2018.

Featuring a bumper crop of local arrangements and compositions, the concert also premiered our first non-singing work for percussion and speech, Ritual and Rain.

For many of us, this was our first foray into choral performance, let alone our adventure in music theory or lashing tongues with Hakka, Korean, Japanese and Tagalog.

It was a challenging year and our performance was not without flaws.

However, our audience told us they were touched by a quality that has become our trademark – our commitment to bare heart, mind and soul.

So we thought we’d drag out a live recording from our archives, cut out the minutes of waiting and intermission, and piece together the essentials for you

Sing Men’s Chorus presents our 2018 journey, Homecoming.
