One of the most popular activities during this period, would have to be baking and it was quite evident, from the newsfeed of our social media accounts! But like cooking, baking is not exactly for everyone also lah, although it can be a lot of fun with the family. Check out Stacci's accidental Mickey and Starri enjoying one!

However, @bakerisingapore had made it really simple and easy, even for a novice like me, to feel the satisfaction of baking oneâ€™s own cookies with their baking kits! All the raw ingredients (except eggs) are provided, so no headaches for me. Check out their latest collaboration with @littlemissbento on some kawaii baking kits too!

But of course their main products are still their cakes & pastries, and their brownies really rocks! I would recommend getting their Teabreak Pack on top of their baking kits when you order. Thanks for sending the kits over, we had so much fun baking our Earl Grey Chocolate cookies and will be trying your brownies next!
