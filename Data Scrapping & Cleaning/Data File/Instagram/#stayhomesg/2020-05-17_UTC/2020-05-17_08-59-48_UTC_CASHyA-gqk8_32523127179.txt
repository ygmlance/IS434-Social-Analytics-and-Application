😋Taste: 9/10 for the tortilla; 8/10 for the gambas. The tortilla exceeded our expectations too! Two years ago, we stood in line in San Sebastián for 1 hour to order 1 of 20 tortillas that was supposedly the best the town had to offer. Been relishing having one again, and while our homemade one will never match up to true Spanish artistry, we were happy enough with our version - sweet, salty, with slightly creamy eggs. The gambas was straightforward, classic, though no particular wow factor. Would make the tortilla again for #spanishfood night round 2!
