Mini wild flowers, wild grass and small blue! Nature is blooming, have you notice them in our urban city? I saw squirrels and sunbirds. I pause to enjoy these moments and soak in their positive energy. Life is beautiful. Prompt me to appreciate and sending loving kindness ❤️ #singapore #stayhomesg #covid19 #wildflowers #wildgrass #butterfly #beautyliesinthemind #joy #peace #calm #pause
