[TOILET PAPER CAKE]
as gimmicky as it looks,  let us thank @breadtalksg for its creativity in coming up with this 'rofl roll' cake to remind everyone to stay calm and positive while rolling on with life amid the covid-19 pandemic.🙏 the sponge cake within the exterior fondant is pretty soft, fluffy, and cottony too. great for pairing with tea!
