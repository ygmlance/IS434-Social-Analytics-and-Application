Day 41 of Circuit breaker.
天气有点暗了。
先吃这两个蛋挞冲击一下。
剩下两个就把它解决了!
香香的pandan味。我喜欢。
Settle my breakkie with these 2 egg tarts first as the sky is dark.
I need to make a round to the market. Eat and wait for the sky to be bright.
Nice pandan smell on the egg tart. I like. 😊
My Tai Cheong egg tart craving settled.
Full stop.
Will eat after Circuit breaker again! 😊
