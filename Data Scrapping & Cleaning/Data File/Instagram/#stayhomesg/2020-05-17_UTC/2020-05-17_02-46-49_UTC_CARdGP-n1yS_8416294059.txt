M A Y 2020
.
We are catching up alot more this month and period, trying to impart in more joy in everyone’s current home bound situation.

Sometimes all we need is some positive distraction and art play. On Friday, we had some play with plants and botanicals. It’s always interesting to see all the beauty everyone comes up with.
A fun afternoon indeed.
Till the next☺️
