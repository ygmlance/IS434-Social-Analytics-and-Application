☆Unicorn Divine & Saving Narwhales☆
A great teambonding session with the lovely ladies - Wee Fong, Kelly, Charlene, Agnes & Janet! While CB separates us, art connects with the help of Zoom!

A private session for these fun loving bunch of art enthusiats, I was trying to keep calm and maintain pace while teaching 2 artworks simultaneously 😅

Wouldn't have been possible without such understanding and eager participants who caught on the concepts and idea fast and applied them well! 👏👏👏👏 I'm so pleased that we actually finished slightly earlier than our stipulated duration and ended the session on a great note!

Thanks for the company and laughter, Wee Fong and team! I hope we can have the chance to paint together again!
