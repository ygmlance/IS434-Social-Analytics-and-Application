Guess whoâ€™s back, back again? 
This indulgent key lime chia seed tart is as zesty as it is delicious, and delightfully sweet with just the right amount of tartness. May your days be as bright as this sunny tart during this trying period.

On a side note, our cakes and tarts are now available for delivery and takeaway from all our outlets. (Yes, finally!) You can order your favourites via GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo. Island-wide delivery (link in bio) is also available with minimum order of $25. While stocks last.
