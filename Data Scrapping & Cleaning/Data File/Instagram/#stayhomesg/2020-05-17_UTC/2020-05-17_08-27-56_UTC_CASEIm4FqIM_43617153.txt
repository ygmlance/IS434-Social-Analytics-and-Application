Decided to make rosti as the potatoes were turning bad. Sour cream is homemade. Added toast w homemade orange marmalade, scrambled eggs, bacon, half plate of wild rocket, shredded carrots, shredded beetroot and baby tomatoes to my big breakfast. Accompanying it with Nutrisoy oats and quinoa soya milk.

Rosti
Grate 2 potatoes into thin slices.
Let it rest and squeeze out the water.
Sprinkle salt and pepper.
Pan fry a layer of potatoes over low heat.
Add another layer until it is big enough.
Cook for 15 mins till the bottom turns brown.
Flip the rosti and cook the other side for 6-8 mins.
Top it with homemade sour cream and rosemary.

Toast
Toast Gardenia enriched white bread for 4 mins.
Spread homemade orange marmalade.
