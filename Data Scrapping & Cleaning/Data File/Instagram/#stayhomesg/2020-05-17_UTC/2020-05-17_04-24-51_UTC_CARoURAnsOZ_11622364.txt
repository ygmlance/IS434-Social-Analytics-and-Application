Fresh pasta has always intimidated me. The simple equation of flour, eggs, labour, and time, plus differing ratios that have come to define different styles and types only become more complicated once I think about it (...or maybe it’s just a ‘me’ problem)

This was my first guided attempt where I learnt how to breathe, feel, and appreciate the transformation of ingredients into comfort food for the person who patiently taught me the basics. Thank you, @matteo.chef
