Making dumplings again today! Adding a new purple color and a new pattern this time. Took up more time to prepare, from blending the various veggies to get the different colours to preparing the dumpling skin. I spent almost 3 hrs on this  alone. 😅
These dumplings were supposed to be for my lunch, but they ended up being my dinner instead! I passed a plate of the dumplings to my neighbor and the response was very encouraging! 😆

今天又做水饺了，加了新的颜色和款式。也花了我好几个小时。我的午餐变成了晚饭了。我也请隔壁邻居吃，他们都说好吃！😁
