Late breakfast for mum and myself today. Mum came out with an idea to make Maggi Mee into a cake! 😂  Staying Home this Circuit Breaker makes her more creative. 
#CooktheDifferencewithMAGGI #MaggiSG #InstantNoodlesCake #noodlecake [Curry Maggi “Cake”] Recipe: 
➊ Cook the noodles for close to 2 mins, then away the water. 
➋ Toss the noodles evenly in half a packet of curry seasoning (feel free to use other flavours but curry is our favourite). ➌ Put the noodles into a bowl/container, press the noodles so that it is compact, cling wrap the bowl and place it into the chiller for about an hour. 
➍ Remove from the chiller and we heat up the noodles in the air fryer for a few mins. 
➎ Decorate. We used tomato sauce, chili sauce and mayonnaise for the word.
