Have been trying to commit to early morning jogs while #toto wfh too. Sneaking in a breakfast jog while the 2 宝贝 are still snug in bed. One thing #stayhomesg and #covid taught me is to be disciplined in life and commit to keeping to daily and life goals. I still have lotsa room for improvement and hope i have enuff time to do so. #busydad #stayhomesg #sgunited #jogs #sgfitfam #fitfam #unclehunkwannabe #igsg #sgig #stayhealthy #staysafe #messyhair #cavemanlook #sundays #sgboy
