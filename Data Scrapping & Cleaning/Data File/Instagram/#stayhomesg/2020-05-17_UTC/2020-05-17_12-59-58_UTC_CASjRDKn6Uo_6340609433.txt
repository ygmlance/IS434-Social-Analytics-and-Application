Tonight dinner from 𝙿𝚘𝚙𝚎𝚢𝚎𝚜! 🍗 ⠀

Good for 5, $32.80. 5pcs Chicken, 5pcs Chicken Tenders, 3pcs biscuit with strawberry jam, 1 large mashed potatoes with Cajun gravy and 4 drinks. Because we love their Mash Potatoes with Cajun gravy so much so we add on 1 additional regular ala carte, $2.60. ⠀
⠀
One of our fav Fast Food for delectable & finger licking good fried chicken! Love their crispy spicy battered, and as you bite in the chicken underneath is still so tender, tasty and juicy! Perfectly fried to perfection💯! That Mash Potatoes with Cajun gravy is another of our fav, it’s so delicious, and there’s small chunks of meat, so irresistible! ⠀
