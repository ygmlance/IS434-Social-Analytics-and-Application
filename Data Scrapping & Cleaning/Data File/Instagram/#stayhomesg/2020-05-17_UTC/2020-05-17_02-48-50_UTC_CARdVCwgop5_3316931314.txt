 𝓫𝓾𝓽 𝓶𝓪𝓴𝓮 𝓲𝓽 𝓯𝓪𝓼𝓱𝓲𝓸𝓷 ❣️🦠❣️🦠 Industry Conversation starter: 
I run the closed FB Pro pairing to @beautycollaborators with @luckymakeup and as I’m sure you can imagine, the conversations about kits and covid are nonstop. 
I can attest that many of us are taking countless online courses, some free and some we are paying for (and they aren’t cheap either) 
Artists are curious as to:

1️⃣ the thoughts from producers / directors / editors / photographers etc... as far as budgets are concerned, do you see it as an option for artists to start charging a ‘sanitization fee’ given that we are now having to add items to our kits that we’ve never needed before. 
2️⃣ maybe it’s still too premature, but what are your expectations from the beauty department given this ‘new normal’ ? 
3️⃣ Talent: how are you feeling about the industry moving forward? 
4️⃣ What are your expectations in the beauty chair? Will you want to bring your own beauty products? 
5️⃣ Do you have any fears, comments or recommendations? 
6️⃣ Studios: just like having first aid kits, will you carry sanitization kits IE UV-C boxes? ⏭ moving forward: any questions or comments?
