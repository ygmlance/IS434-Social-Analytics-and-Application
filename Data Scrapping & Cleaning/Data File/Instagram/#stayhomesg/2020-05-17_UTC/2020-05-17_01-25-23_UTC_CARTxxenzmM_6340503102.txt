I love Big Macs and I cannot lie 🤪 burgers are cultures in their own right! .
.
I haven’t been able to lay my hands on one yet, since @mcdsg reopened this week in Singapore 🍔 staying safe first!
.
.
And what do we do when we crave for food? Apparently, draw it, animate it, and then maybe make a felt version of it 🍔 >> swipe to see! 🤣🤣🤣 . . 
Disclaimer: I liberally swapped out pickles for tomatoes... who’s with me? Comment with a 🍅 for Team Tomato or 🥒 for Team Pickles if you’ve read this far! 😊
.
. 
Hope everyone is doing well! As usual, I’m just a text message or phone call away if you ever need to talk or need help in any way ❤️
.
.
Stay strong and stay safe, my dears! ❤️
