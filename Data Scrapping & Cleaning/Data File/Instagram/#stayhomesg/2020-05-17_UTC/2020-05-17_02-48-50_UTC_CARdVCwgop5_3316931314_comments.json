I think it\u2019s so hard for us to know yet as the science keeps shifting so deeply.... we all want to work, and we all want nothing more than the person to feel safe, and precautions to be backed by science and not just opinion. I have friends in China who say it\u2019s just all pretty much life back to normal now, except people wear masks outside out of politeness (but not necessarily by state order). That was just one friend though so also could be way wrong. I\u2019ve personally gone ahead and done the barbacide courses along with studying up protocols from AICP & a couple other still unofficial resources. I\u2019ve gotten one of those UV boxes, gloves, masks, as well as face shields, but who knows if I\u2019ll have to wear them all at once or if we find out they\u2019re unnecessary! \nI want whoever is in my chair feeling comfortable and safe too :)",
