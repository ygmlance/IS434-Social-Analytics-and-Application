FAT LOSS TIP!

If you struggle to lose weight or keep the weight off during Ramadan, read on.👇🏻

✋🏻Stop eating excessively✋🏻
.
Overeating is always the number 1 reason why we are not losing weight at any time of the month. We might never think that we can overeat during the month of Ramadan as we are fasting for the most part of the day. In fact we tend to overeat at this period during Ramadan - Suhoor, Iftar and over the weekends.
.
For Suhoor, do give yourself enough time to prepare and have a quality meal. Often we can overeat due to not giving ourselves enough time before the fast starts as we will grab and gobble up anything and everything to ensure enough food to sustain for the day.
.
Plan your food ahead of time for iftar.  Having small bites and hydrating yourself first can help to control your hunger signals before filling your plate. We tend to overeat during this time as our hunger signals are at the highest since we have been fasting for the most part of the day.
.
When you plan for gatherings over the weekends, do also plan for your food for these gatherings. We often cut loose during the weekends as it is less structured which usually results in consuming more calories for the whole week.
