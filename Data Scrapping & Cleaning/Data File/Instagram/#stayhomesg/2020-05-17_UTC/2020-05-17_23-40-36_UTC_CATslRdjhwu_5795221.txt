ðŸŒ¤"Today I will be as useless as the 'G' in lasagna." ðŸ˜‚ I spent the last few days relaxing, refreshing, recharging & recovering from my hamstring strain. I can't believe I'm at the point of enjoying moving & sweating that rest days seem like an eternity to me ðŸ˜‚ But as always after rest day/s my body feels so much better & I come back stronger (even though I'm still going to be taking it really easy ðŸ¤—) â€¢
