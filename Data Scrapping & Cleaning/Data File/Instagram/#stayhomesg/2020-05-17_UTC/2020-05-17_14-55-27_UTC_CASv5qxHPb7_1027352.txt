Having salivated over @szeliang888’s multiple Instagram Stories whenever he posted about his favourite biryani place - @mrbiryanisg, I gleefully accepted his offer of a treat from there.
And now it’s crystal clear to me why he is a big fan. Everything in the spread of food he ordered was in-your-face delicious.
Take your regular #biryani and amplify it, and you’ll get an idea of what #mrbiryanisg’s is like. If I thought their Chicken Biryani was a joy to eat, their vegetarian Green Brinjal #Biryani was the real shocker. Unbelievably tasty, the spice-rich basmati rice had whole mini, plump eggplants from Thailand buried in there, lying in wait to send every one of us to gastronomic heaven with their squishy-softness. 
All the dishes seem to possess an intensity in aroma and flavour I hadn’t encountered in a long time. And a few were total mindblowers.
For eg. I don’t usually order #PalakPaneer when I dine at an Indian restaurant but I would definitely make an exception for Mr. Biryani’s. Theirs is not “jelak” at all. And those cubes of cottage cheese did such an uncanny impersonation of chicken meat @huatkaliao and his brother were convinced it was poultry 😂😂
Also beautifully balanced was the
#ButterChicken. Many places do versions that veer into “just-too-much” territory but not these guys. They were right on the button.
The Bhindi Marsala was another dish that fell into my “one-of-the-best-I’ve-eaten” category. It enthralled with its mix of spices and oiliness. I know the naysayers will whine about it not being healthy but the liberal use of oil is partly the reason why the food is so darn flavourful.
An exception would be the grilled Tandoori Chicken which was smoky, tender and moist within. I contemplated for a couple of seconds before abandoning my cutlery to eat it with fingers. It was so good. 
@szeliang888, thank you again for opening my eyes (and appetite) to the wonders of this restaurant! My family is also won over. So henceforth, no prizes for guessing where we’ll order from when the #dumbiryani craving hits.
