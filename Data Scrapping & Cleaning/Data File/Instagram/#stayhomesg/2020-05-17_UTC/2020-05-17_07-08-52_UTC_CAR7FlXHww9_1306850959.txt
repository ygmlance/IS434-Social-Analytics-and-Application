🌿The sun shines. The rain falls. The grass grows - The world is doing just what it should. 🌿 Did all of you notice the beautiful wild flowers that are growing along pathways in your neighborhood? So pretty and such a happy sight! Let’s slow down and enjoy our surroundings. 🥰 Today, I’m eating vegetarian bee hoon. Sometimes, I wonder if this kind of vegetarian bee hoon is “made in Singapore” only or also sold in other Asian countries, with the same preparation and presentation? Anyway, it’s one of those comfort brunch locally. On my way home from Chong Pang, I walked past many huge trees and got the idea to recreate my vegetarian bee hoon into a bird nest on a tree. I especially 加料with 2 hard boiled eggs for this bird nest! 🤣Interestingly, I received other different interpretations of this piece of food art, such as Cookie Monster, snail etc. 🤪🤪🤪 What do you think? Food for thought... 😆Happy Sunday everyone! I hope I’ll be able to release episode 6 of my study trip and complete more online brush lettering classes today! 💪💪💪🥳🥳🥳
