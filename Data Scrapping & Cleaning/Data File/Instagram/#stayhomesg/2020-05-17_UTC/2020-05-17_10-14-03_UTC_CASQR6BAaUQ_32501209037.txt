It's May; the month when Mother's Day occurs, we thought of our maternal grandma and late paternal granny whose birthday falls in the same month.

When my mother was pregnant with the youngest of us, we were hit financially hard. It was shortly after the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 when we had yet to recover from my father's business wind down.

During this difficult period when even a bowl of rice was tough to obtain, our paternal grandmother purchased, prepared and cooked for us, especially for my mother during her confinement. Our maternal grandmother had also bought a bottle of Dom Benedictine as a tonic to replenish my mother's health.

During confinement, Sesame Oil Chicken is an important dish to dispel pathogenic wind (qu feng), and ginger is a must-have ingredient. Despite her old age, our granny hand pounded kilogrammes of ginger daily, putting painstaking effort into this dish. To add greater medicinal value to the dish, Dom Benedictine was added as well.

Today, during CB period, a situation similar to a confinement whereby we have to stay indoor for our own good, we decided to whip up this dish. 
It's been more than two decades and yet this dish and the memories which accompany still warm our hearts. If only granny were still here, she could have tasted this very dish handcrafted by her grown up grandchildren.
