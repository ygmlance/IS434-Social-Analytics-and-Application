circuit breaker day [???] totally lost count of how many days CB has been and havent been updating this acct for a long time because work has been weighing me down emotionally till i decided to take time off work for days. 
But, bellies still needa be filled; the sun will still rise the next day, and so i have chosen to focus on happiness instead. 
And happiness is in doing what we love, progressing in our hobby at our own pace, and having a homecooked meal with loved ones. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 #sgfooddiary #stayhomesg #singaporehomecooks #igfood #happybellyhappymind #homecookedfood
