WASABI SALMON TOAST?!
Prepared a hearty breakfast to clear my nose with a generous amount of wasabi! So for this week’s theme on #CBfoodieSG, it is SALMON, and the perfect combination will be with Wasabi and Avocado haha.

For a dessert toast, I decided to make the same checkered toast with alternating matcha jam and Baker & Cook’s Raspberry Jam
