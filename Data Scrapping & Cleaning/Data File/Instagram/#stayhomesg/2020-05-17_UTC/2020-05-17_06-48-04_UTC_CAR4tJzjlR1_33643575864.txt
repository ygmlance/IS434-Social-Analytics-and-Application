We're back with a new session next Saturday - this time for parents who are juggling #WFH with #HBL on top of the pandemic crisis.

Join us on 23rd May, 4 PM with Shan Wee (@dadleycooper), Kiss92 DJ and author of the book ‘99 Rules For New Dads’, and psychotherapist Jolene Hwee (@dear_clarity) in a candid discussion about parenting in a pandemic and how parents can take care of their own mental health during this period.
