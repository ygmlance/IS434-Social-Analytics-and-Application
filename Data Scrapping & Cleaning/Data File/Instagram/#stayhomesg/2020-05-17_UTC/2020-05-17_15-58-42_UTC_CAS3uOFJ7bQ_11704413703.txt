☆EVER HEARD YOUR MUMMY SAYS: BECAUSE OF YOU, I BECOME THIS SIZE🤭

Mummy you are wrong..Look at her! Stacey lost 7kg in 2 months after her pregnancy. With determination and consistency. She did it.

Water plays a very important part in weight loss journey. Is ok to hug the toilet bowl or just move yourself to stay near the toilet..walking to-and-fro is a form of exercise too.🤭
.
I'm not looking for another Stacey, but I want people who has the will to change, ready or not is ok as long you are on fire🔥🔥🔥
