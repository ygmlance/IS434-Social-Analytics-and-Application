#athomewithnature as our balcony garden is expanding. Today we planted from seeds some lettuce, cucumber and passion fruit, some tomato from cutting and some celery and onion from kitchen scrap. Will update in few weeks what worked better ! Ioana learned better from planting, watering and plucking tomatoes the plant life cycle and the related vocabulary. #montessoricuioana check out these accounts for more ideas of bringing more nature into your home: @natventurebooks @mrsahgohgoh @ourmindfulpod @ow.montessori.family
