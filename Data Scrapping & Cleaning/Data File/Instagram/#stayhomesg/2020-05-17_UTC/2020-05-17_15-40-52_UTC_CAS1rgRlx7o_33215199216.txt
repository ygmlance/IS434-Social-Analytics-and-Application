The cosy interiors of @grandmamascafe in Juhu, Mumbai.

It's been quite a while since we last went out for a meal. In fact, we cannot even remember when the last time was. A month ago? Two months ago? Who can tell? Eating out was something we kinda took for granted.

That said, we are still quite lucky to be in the comfort of our homes, with the ability to order in once in a while. Hawker centres remain open in Singapore, but with dining not allowed, take-away is still possible. Even if we feel lazy or want to just stay away from the kitchen for a day, we know there is this option we can exercise.

Apps like @swiggyindia and @zomatoin are going the extra mile by ensuring restaurants meet the necessary hygiene standards as well as introducing initiatives like contactless delivery. @grab_sg in Singapore has started an initiative called Local Heroes to support smaller businesses that have been severely impacted.

In these circumstances, we should be more thankful to the people behind the industry who ensure things keep ticking. From chefs in delivery kitchens to the delivery agents working in these trying times, they have all been working extra hard during these uncertain times to help ensure regular office-goers who are working from home now are well fed.
