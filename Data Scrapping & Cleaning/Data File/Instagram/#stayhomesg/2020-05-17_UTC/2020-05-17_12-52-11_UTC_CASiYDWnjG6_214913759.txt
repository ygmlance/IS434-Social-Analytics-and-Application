This dense and moist brandied fruitcake is the real deal.
Emptied a whole bottle of Martell to soak the fruits in for I forgot how long until I decided to bake it. For the last 2 weeks, it’s been sitting in my sister’s freezer (mine is bursting) wrapped with a VSOP soaked towel. Okay, I might have gone just a little overboard with the alcohol but mum approved. Now to let in continue resting in the freezer.  My late cousin first introduced brandied fruitcake to us when I was little but I didn’t like it much then. And when I finally can appreciate it... So I tried to recreate the texture and taste of her baking. It’s close but not quite there yet. Something I can’t put my finger on. Yet. #iamnotafruitcake #bakingafruitcakeinmay
