Sunday morning craft! 😁 Mummy noticed that I like cutting up paper with my new scissors ✂️ so she came up with this craft idea. She drew out lines on a piece of red paper and asked me to cut them out. I cut out 8 strips of paper! We glued the ends together to form a sort of paper ball. To complete the look of an apple, Mummy cut out a brown pipe cleaner and stuck it on top, and I attached a green paper leaf to it... Tada - my red apple!!! 🍎
