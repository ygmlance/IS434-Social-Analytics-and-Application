So I’ve been asked what I’ve been up do during CB. Besides trying to keep up with HBL & keeping kids occupied every single day for the past 7 weeks, team & I have also been working hard to create useful & uplifting content under an initiative we started, called #HerWorldWithYou. We have stories on surviving the home office battle, tips for staying sane while staying home & more. Fun part, team also got together to share our #WFH style tips and here’s mine. What I like about #wfh so far is that I get to wake up, wash up & get to work in 5 min! Tbh, I’ve attended teleconferences in my PJs too for those of us who have the option to turn off the camera. But for those who are required to look more presentable for your video calls, it’s really easy to simply accessorise with the stuff you possibly already have at home (or not. But accessorising can be rather inexpensive too). Tap #LinkinBio for more chic tips. •
