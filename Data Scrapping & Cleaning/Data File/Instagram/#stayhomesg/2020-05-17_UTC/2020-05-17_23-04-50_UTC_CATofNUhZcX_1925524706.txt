The covid-19 pandemic has brought lots of changes to our lives. Some bad, some good. Although the number of cases in SG is still rising (i think we have more than 26k confirmed cases at the moment and 22 deaths), let's not lose hope and keep counting our blessings.

Thank you to the medical/health care team for still hanging in there and giving your best to cope with the situation. Thank you to the other frontliners for your hardwork (from cleaning public places to delivering food to our doors). Thank you to everyone who has been staying at home in our attempt to keep the infection rate low. Let's continue to work together and not congregate (regardless of our urge to do so) yet after this extended CB period is over.
