After we created our paper apple 🍎, we thought it looked lonely 😔 so we decided to create a paper banana🍌 to accompany it! Again, Mummy drew lines on a piece of yellow paper and I cut out six strips. We glued the strips onto a toilet roll and folded in the tops and ends. Mummy coloured them the way a banana would look and drew lines down its body... Now my paper apple is no longer lonely cos it has a paper banana for companionship! 🤗
