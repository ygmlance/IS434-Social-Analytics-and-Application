yo gurls @charliethewauzer and I got into the TOP 20 of @singforsg , a virtual singing competition to raise funds for Food Bank SG. 
You can tune in LIVE to the quarter finals tomorrow 18 May 7.30pm (GMT+8) on the @singforsg FB page. I will be presenting my song LIVE alongside 9 other participants. Audience votes makes up part of my score so after the performance, go on to @singforsg FB page and like plus share my performance vid! Every like counts ðŸ˜‰

You can most definitely help by donating $10 or more so that Food Bank SG can distribute food to families who need it. 
Drop me a DM, I can send you the link if you need!
