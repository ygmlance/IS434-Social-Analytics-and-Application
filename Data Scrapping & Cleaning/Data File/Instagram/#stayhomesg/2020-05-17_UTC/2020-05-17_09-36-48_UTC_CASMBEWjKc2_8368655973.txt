Homemade Char Siew Pau! Mom buying pau flour instead of bread flour turned out to a silver lining because we ended up having lots of fun making this and the paus turned out to be 老少皆宜 - both the parents and the nephews liked them! Though we should really work on the consistency of the size of the pau (see the diff between 2nd and 3rd pic) the next time 😄
