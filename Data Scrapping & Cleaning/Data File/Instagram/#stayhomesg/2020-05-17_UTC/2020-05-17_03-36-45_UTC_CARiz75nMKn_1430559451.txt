Giving does make me feel alive.

In the afterword of this editon, @MitchAlbom shares the biggest message of his book: giving is living. His college professor Morris Schwartz was 'invested in giving himself away (to others). At some some point, during his dying, it became his immortality.' Morris succumbed to ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) in 1995, and his joint 'thesis' with Albom on the meaning of life was published 2 years later.

I reread a few pages just before going to bed earlier this morning. This personal copy is among the 190+ items I hope to list in a digital catalogue—yup, the book I'm writing—by July and in turn raise a modest sum to support an ongoing project lifting others out of the coronavirus crisis. More details soon!

Moreover, I'm still looking to move abroad. Whenever I look at it this way, I can see how absurd it is that I hoard possessions.

Blessed weekend, everyone!
