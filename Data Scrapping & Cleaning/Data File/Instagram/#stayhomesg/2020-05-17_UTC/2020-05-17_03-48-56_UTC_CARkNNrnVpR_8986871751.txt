Girlsourced stylists are located around the world, bringing you style recommendations with an international perspective. Keep a lookout as we handover our IG account to them! 😎⁠⠀
⁠⠀
We are starting with a throwback to #Stylistnumber1 Costina Iodarche @costinai, based in Romania and a little peek into her life now. Like most other countries the COVID-19 situation is affecting Romania and so Costina makes sure she and her little one, Leah mask up whenever they are up and about. Here, Leah and her are donning handmade masks from local Romanian brand @mamisileah.ro, who are donating masks for the front liners in Romania with every purchase made.⁠⠀

Look out for more from Costina as she takes over our Insta account this week! Get ready for the takeover finale where she will bring you style tips by video 📹 that you can use at this time 💃 home or not.⁠⠀
