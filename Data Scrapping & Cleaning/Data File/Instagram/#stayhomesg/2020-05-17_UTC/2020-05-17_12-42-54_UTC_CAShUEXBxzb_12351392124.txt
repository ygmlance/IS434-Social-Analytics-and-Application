It was indeed a fruitful and useful meeting between @rrg_sg members and our Indonesian Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW) friends on #zoom. 
Some of the topics that were covered include hot-button issues such as rejecting #fakenews, performing #hariraya #aidilfitri prayers at home, and payment of #zakat online. 
Our FDWs have raised many concerns and the RRG members assured them that the government of #singapore has done everything possible to curb the #virus. 
Thank you Ustaz Abdul Manaf Rahmat, Ustaz Dr @leyaket_ali, and Ustazah @kalthom_isa for leading the meeting. Special mention to Ustaz Muslim Amad (@musallam_amad) from @almuttaqinsg for sharing his knowledge with the FDWs too!
