82% Hydration Basic Sourdough 🍞
.
🍴Overall ease: 2/10
.
🛒Ingredients: 20% rye starter, flour, salt, water
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: same process, but to increase the hydration to 82%. Decided to do a spiral design for scoring.
.
😋Taste: 8/10. We were hoping for larger air pockets, but it didn’t live up to our hopes. Might be the scoring, or the fermentation, or the oven temp... who knows 😂 Back to the drawing board!
