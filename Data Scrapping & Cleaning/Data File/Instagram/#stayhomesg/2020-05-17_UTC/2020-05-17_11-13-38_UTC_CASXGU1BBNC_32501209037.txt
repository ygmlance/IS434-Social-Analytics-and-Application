When it comes to sweet potato, I'm sure it rings a bell in many Singaporeans. Not only was it a survival food item during the WWII era, it definitely was a fond childhood memory for us.

Years ago, when times were tough, our family merely survived with porridge and soya sauce. My mother recalled how we, the then young kids, often whined about how other children got to eat rice and drumsticks while we always had the same plain food. Little did we know, mother and father barely ate and gave most of the food that we have to us, in hope that it will fill our tiny stomachs.

One day, our mother came home with a bag of groceries, and something unfamiliar to us caught our attention. Beaming with happiness, she said, "Today, we won't be having soya sauce. I bought some sweet potatoes. Let's try them!" We were exhilirated and loved it the moment we tasted it. Contrary to the saltiness that we were all too familiar with, the sweet potato gives off a sweet and pleasant taste, satisfying our taste buds effortlessly.

As sweet potatoes come in a variety of colours, mother cooked a different coloured one each day and we were all fascinated by it. I remembered how my sister loved the orange coloured one because she believed it was orange flavoured, while my brother loved the purple coloured one simply because it was his favourite colour.

Sweet potato porridge has created a lot of fond memories for us as it has sweetened our days and made the hardships less agonising.

It may be a cheap food item that many children dread today, but it is one of our most valued and appreciated food till today.
