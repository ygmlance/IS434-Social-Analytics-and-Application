Love in many language. One of them is through the tummy! Hubs surprised me buying my fav buah keluak for dinner on friday and I at the same time(without knowing)had prepared to surprise him with his fav laksa on sat! It need not be elaborate, but depending on how you know your partner's love language, if we can meet 1 of it this period, it is worthwhile to consider doing it. üòç
Hubs knows how i dread making this laborious dish so i thought while I can afford to this during #circuitbreaker #stayhomesg I better do it now! My helper and I laboured almost 5hrs to make this dish. It's my 2nd time making only. Am grateful to be able to do that.
Both of us felt full in the tummies and full in our hearts.
It can be something simple but meaningful, what is it? May you have a good sunday rest!
