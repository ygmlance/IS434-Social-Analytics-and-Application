Their first art jam together! We are currently experiencing our one month of #stayhome season, all the non-essential shops are closed and we ran out of paint at day 5 ðŸ˜„ So I made some that is baby friendly too so that Harley can have a go and they had a blast at their little pop-up atelier! The ingredients are safe for babies, just be prepared for a somewhat coloured splashed children for the rest of the day! Here is a simple edible recipe from learning4kids: 
Ingredients:  4 Tablespoons of corn flour  Cold water  1 cup of boiling water
Method:  In a medium saucepan, mix the cornflour with enough cold water to make a paste. (Not too runny).
Pour in 1 cup of boiling water and stir thoroughly so there are no lumps.
Turn on medium heat on the stove and mix. The mixture will start to change and you will notice some clear streaks forming in the mixture. Once you see this, turn off the heat and continue stirring. It will start to thicken and turn into a wonderful, custard-like consistency.
Spoon equal amounts into empty jars, cups or containers and add food colouring. Mix until completely combined. For each colour, add 3 drops of yellow, green, red and blue. To make orange, add 1 drop of red and 2 yellow and to make purple, add 1 drop of blue and 2 red.
Store in the fridge covered with cling wrap for up to 2 weeks. This paint recipe does not have any preservative in it, so it is important to check that the paint has not expired before giving it to children.
