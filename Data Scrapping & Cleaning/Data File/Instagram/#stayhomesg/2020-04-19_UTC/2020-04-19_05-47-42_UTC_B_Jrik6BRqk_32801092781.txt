Circuit breaker Day 13: Vietnamese food 👍👍👍 Favvv place to have pho & dry viet noodles! The BBQ pork is so delicious. Ordered 5 mains for 4 of us, managed to finish it all. Wish they offered hot coffee on their takeaway menu but too bad there’s only iced variations. Avocado smoothie 🥑 on point as always!
📍Mrs Pho (Rangoon road)
