ZENG ZENG! 曾煮母开门大吉！

What begun as an annual CNY tradition since 20+ years ago for Mama Zeng to remember her hometown is now coming into your homes! This circuit breaker period, we're delivering pockets of sunshine to our love ones starting with a 'family-only-secret-recipe' dumplings! 
Though we're not together now, but as these babies would say - 团圆在眼前, 温暖在心尖 ❤️
