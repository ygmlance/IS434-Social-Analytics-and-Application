My favourite thing this week has been opening up the submissions page to see what people have added. Even though fear is the emotion that I struggle the most with, looking at these marks and colours that people have put onto paper makes me feel connected to the people around me in a way that is hard to put into words. Thank you to everyone who has added to the reservoir of drawings! I hope the process was good for you in some way too. ⁠
