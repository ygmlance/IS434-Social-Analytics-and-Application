CB Day 54: My Hi-tea Ladies are the best friends to be extra with. Before CB, we caught up every month over fancy pants lunch or tea and a show. We also set up elaborate picnics every now and then. Because we miss our shenanigans so much, we decided to have a Fatih watch party on Zoom and ordered the same atas cheese box from @nomads.soiree to feel even more like together-gether.

Thank you, @nomads.soiree, for the delectable selection of cheese, fruit, crackers, dips and other goodies in our boxes. And thank you, @esplanadesingapore, for streaming this epic production! Love the music, aesthetics and energy of Fatih. Got Game of Thrones Night King cameo all! ðŸ˜‚ (Refer to final pic... It's actually a sea god lah. Lol!)
