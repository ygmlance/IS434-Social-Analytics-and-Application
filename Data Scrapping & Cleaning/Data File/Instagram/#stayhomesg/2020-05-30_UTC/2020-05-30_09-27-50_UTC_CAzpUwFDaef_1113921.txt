[Fleur de Sel] - A very lovely takeaway lunch from @fleurdesel_sg at Tras Street. They have recently launched their 3rd edition menu. They are sous-vide packed and you just need to warm them up at home to eat.

I had the Beef Cheek Bourguignon, Lobster Bisque and Seabass Papillote. I felt like a fine dining chef at home with the easy to prep meals.
