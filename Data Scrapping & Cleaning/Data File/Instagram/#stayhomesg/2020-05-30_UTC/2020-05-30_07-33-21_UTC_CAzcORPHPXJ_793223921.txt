Here’s some awesome news to kick off the last weekend of the #circuitbreaker: We have restocked our Rose Lychee cakes! (You asked and we heard you!) We’ve got many requests from fans of this delish and gorgeous cake to bring it back, so we had decided to make a small batch and they are now available to order from our online store (link in bio). The cakes are limited, so don’t wait and place your order while they last!
