Breaking Circuit 54...
Virtual traveling with our friends. Currently residing in 4 different countries. River, our group akela, took us for a walk in Singapore. His advice, 'to check page “69” of the Geylang guide book talking about pleasures...'. ' Quite a challenge with the masks on!'. It is a bit different than the 'Summer of 69 by Brian Adams. The Canadian government of South Park officially apologized for that...Closely connected in a sanitized, Covid-friendly way. It's all about laughs, love and friends. Connoisseur way!
PS: Thank you unknown creator of this fantastic Lonely Planet series. You made my day. Now I am going for my actual walk.
