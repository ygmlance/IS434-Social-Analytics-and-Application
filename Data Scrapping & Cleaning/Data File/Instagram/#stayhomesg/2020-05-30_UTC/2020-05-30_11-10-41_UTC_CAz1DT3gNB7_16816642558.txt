#B4IMGONEChallenge

It's Hiphop Saturday and today I'm posting Rapped entries! In light of what's happening in America right now, I'm sending love to all Emcees and Hiphop artists to use their lyrics to bring change - words are power! Check out the words of my brother from the Westcoast. 
Name: @youguey ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡® Country: Ivory Coast 
Love me #B4ImGone:  Originating from Ivory coast, West Africa, BONY  Youguey is a brainchild of old school of hip hop. Continuously setting his bar high in order to become the best version of himself he looks to icons like 2pac, Notorious B.I.G, Kendrick Lamar, J.Cole and Rapsody as influences. This Ivorian rapper knows it's bigger than Hiphop and is an emcee pursuing a bachelor in finance as he pens his life journeys in his music. His lyrics are truthful, his message positive and maintains a humble attitude of constant self improvement. He has blessed stages from Abidjan & Accra to Taipei, Kaohsiung and Hualien in Taiwan,  recording his music in French and English. 
Masia's fave #youguey song: His most recent release 'Amazing Grace' asks difficult and sometimes controversial questions in thinking of the existence of a God and the suffering of this world. I love rappers that are actually saying something with their lyrics!
