“This Nutty, smooth, moist in texture and ghee laden sweet porridge was our breakfast today 😍
-
I don't like halwa/porridge when its white (not roasted in ghee well) & dry (It should have sufficient amount of ghee)
-
This Porridge keeps the hunger away for long, bcz of all ingredients it has. Swipe right to see what goes in this delicious #porridge ❤️ Of course you can add or remove any ingredient as per choice but whole-wheat flour, sugar/jaggery, ghee and water is must.

Ingredients:
➡️Whole-wheat flour
➡️Clarified butter (ghee)
➡️Sugar or jaggery
➡️Organic Nuts (I've used cashew, almonds, raisins, Pistachio & dried Coconut)
➡️Organic Saffron ➡️Water

I've used "Organic Raw Sugar" from @naturesglorysg , one of my most favorite & trusted brand. I recommend it without a single thought, they support a Non-GMO policy for all their products.
This Raw sugar is pesticide free, no colouring no additives ❤️
