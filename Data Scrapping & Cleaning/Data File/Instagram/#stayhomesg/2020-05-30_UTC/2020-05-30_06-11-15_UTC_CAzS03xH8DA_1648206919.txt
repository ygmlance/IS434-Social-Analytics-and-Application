Here’s one dish that we’re pretty certain everyone has tasted at least once in their life, albeit in some form or another.

Otah is basically a fishcake made with spices and coconut milk, and due to its popularity, there are are many versions of this, not just in Singapore, but throughout the world.

True to our Nonya roots, our otah includes turmeric and galangal, and is wrapped in banana leaves before steaming.

Inside you get pieces of mackerel and prawns - texture is what makes or breaks this simple dish.

To finish off the process, these lovely otahs are placed on the grill for a couple of minutes, so that you get that amazing charred aroma from the banana leaves.

You can get this ala-carte or with our family meal sets. We’re open everyday for lunch and dinner, and we offer FREE ISLANDWIDE DELIVERY for orders $50 and above. Link in bio.
