As the weekend is here and Circuit Breaker comes to an end, why not indulge in some sweet treats and good coffee?

Acoustic Cafe focuses on serving coffee, light bites and brunch! Their popular bakes are their in-house brownies!

Their key concept is to enjoy quality music with specialty coffee. With the current dine-in restrictions, you can however, STILL enjoy their sound system when you hop on to their store for takeaway and while waiting for your food!

For takeaway, you can pre-order via their Telegram channel
(https://t.me/acousticcafe) or via Facebook messenger. Alternatively, they can be found on Grab Food and Foodpanda for delivery services.

Operating hours: 10:00am - 7:00pm, closed on Tuesday
