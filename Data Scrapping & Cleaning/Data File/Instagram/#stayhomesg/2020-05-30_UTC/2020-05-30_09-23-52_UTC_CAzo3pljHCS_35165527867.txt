🍰 Finally got my craving for carrot cake for months fixed! 😂 (it took long because I have so many cravings so they need to queue up 😅😅😅) This is my first time having carrot cake from @starbuckssg , I’ve heard a lot of good reviews on their carrot cakes and it really is GOOD! the cake part is sooo moistttt, great amount of carrots, AND A LOT of walnuts!! (I’m giving extra hearts for this 💓🥰). The sweetness is on point!!! but I do wish it’s a bit more dense...Also...the cream cheese is wayyyyy tooo sweeeettt for me, but pls take note i’m the less-sweet kind of person 😅 
so I scraped cream cheese off a bit 😬 and it’s just almost perfect to me hehee 😋😋😋😋😋 anyway, I’m SATISFIED.

Price: 6.5sgd (it’s so big though like a slice on top of another slice 😂) Follow me @snacko.muncho for moreeee snacks to come 😬🤤😋
