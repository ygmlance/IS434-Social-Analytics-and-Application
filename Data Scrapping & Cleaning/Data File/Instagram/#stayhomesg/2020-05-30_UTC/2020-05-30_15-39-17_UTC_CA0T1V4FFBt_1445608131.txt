[LAST CHANCE] Our Ziwi Peak pet food bundle promotions are ending tomorrow! 🐶🐱 Did you know? In 2004, Ziwi Peak Pet Food became the first to develop Air-Dried Pet Food based on the nature-inspired WholePrey Diet. 🍖

As natural carnivores, cats & dogs are intrinsically inclined to choose meat. Ziwi Peak’s unique, meaty texture, taste and aroma have made these scrumptious morsels hard to resist! 😋

Made in New Zealand with premium, locally-sourced ingredients, Ziwi Peak Pet Food does not contain glycerine or any fillers like grains, potatoes, peas, rice and corn. 🇳🇿 All of their recipes have a high meat content of 96% and are rich in protein — 
A convenient way to give your pet the nutrients he needs and craves! 🐺 Grab them now while you still can!
