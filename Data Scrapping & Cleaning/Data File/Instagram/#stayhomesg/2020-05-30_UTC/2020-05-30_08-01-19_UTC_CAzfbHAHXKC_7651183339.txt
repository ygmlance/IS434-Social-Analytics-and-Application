“At first, they were shy. Being able to speak in the same tongue helped to bridge the gap so I could better meet their needs,” - Iam Thamo, volunteer.

Iam has volunteered EVERY DAY of his time this past month to deliver food to migrant workers in need! For him, volunteering with Wok the Talk is about building meaningful connections and truly giving to others. Knowing that some migrant workers he was helping to deliver food to enjoyed pickled mangoes, he personally bought 20 cans as gifts for them! We are truly moved by his generosity!
