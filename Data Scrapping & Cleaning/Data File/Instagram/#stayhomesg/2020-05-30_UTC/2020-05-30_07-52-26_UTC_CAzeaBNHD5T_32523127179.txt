😋Taste: 10/10. So straightforward and yet a mighty flavour bomb with a bounty of ingredients! Would suggest to use high quality seafood and tomatoes for maximum payoff. Also recommend to constantly taste and adjust - our stew tasted bland 30 mins in, so we amp-ed up the flavour by reducing it further and adding in more chicken stock.

P.S. It tasted even better the next day!
