I decided to put on my fanciest dress and cooked Filipino spaghetti in style! Since I can’t wear it out this circuit breaker, I might as well wear it at home! Everyday is a gift especially during this time. Let’s not waste it on negativity and find ways to make yourself smile despite the pandemic. Life is beautiful with family and friends to laugh with you even through social media!
