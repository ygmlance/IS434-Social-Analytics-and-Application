🎈I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow, but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing. 🎈 We all love living and being alive so just make the best out of your life, in your own unique way, at your own pace. ❤️ Last night, I came across a video posted by my dear friend @mlondoh on a very simple hotdog puff recipe. Coincidentally, I have the relevant ingredients in my fridge! 😁😁😁 So, here I am, eating mini hotdog puffs! Of course, I have to do some patterns and I recreated them as balloons held by a little cute girl with her pet dog and puppy! Holding balloons is always such a lovely and dreamy experience and I think most children (including myself) love it! However, as we grow older, I feel that being able to have the courage to let go of balloons (or anything that you are holding on so tightly that it hurts) is even more beautiful and touching, don’t you think so? 😌 In any case, if you are keen to try out this recipe, you can refer to the YouTube link below. I added some shredded cheese and paired them with tomato sauce (see the hearts on the plate) and mustard sauce (recreated as grassland). Have a hopeful, lovely and dreamy weekend just like these beautiful hotdog puff balloons!🎈🎈🎈
