As immaculately prepared as I expect of @taro.chef’s food, his #GuerillaBento this week was infinitely more WOW than I could imagine, especially since it cost only $38! The #Barachirashi Takayama-style boasted much bigger-than-normal cuts of fish, scallop and seafood and they were all superb in quality and taste. There was a freshly-baked mini Burnt Matcha Cheesecake with Strawberry Sauce for dessert as well. You bet I was wreathed in smiles as I ravished my set meal.
For the benefit of those who DM-ed me, Chef Taro’s “Guerilla #Bento” is available only on Saturdays and it changes every time. He prepares only 20 sets, and you never know what is going to be in there until he shares a snippet of what’s coming in his Instagram Stories, sometime in the middle of the week. These meals are inspired by moments in his life, such as a favourite childhood dish or something he recalls enjoying at a point in his travels. Therefore, his Guerilla Bentos are really quite special because of that emotional connection you’ll have to him. 
To book one for yourself, please follow @taro.chef since ordering is only via DM to him (not @sgtakayama restaurant).
