Day 54 of Circuit breaker.
I do not want to waste these two slices of bread crust from my Gardenia bread.
Anyway i am using for toasting. So I think it is more crispy this way.
I steamed the Otar and meshed it and spread on the bread layer with cheese slice.
Wrapped with foil and toast. You can use oven to toast too. I preferred my mini grilled pan.
I save time so I just overlapped both together to grilled it at one go.
Served with a poached egg and steam eggs, some lettuces and tomatoes.
This Loaf of Gardenia served up to 5 different breakfast from last Sunday onwards. Pretty cool. And I really like all the out come.
Everything made were all my first attempt !
