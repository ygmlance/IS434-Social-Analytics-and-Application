Not only did I receive bags of @tiaptiapwithsoph’s homemade savoury and sweet food, but also a great tip on how to enjoy her Steamed Radish Kueh and Yam Kueh even more.
So I followed her suggestion and dipped slices of them in beaten egg before pan-frying. The result was wonderful as the fragrance was enhanced and more texture was added. Glad to see Sophie also included garnishes with every order of her Kueh because a sprinkle of fried shallots, chopped chives and sliced red chillies went a long way. 
If you asked me which I’d order again, I would pick the Radish Kueh as its softness is extremely appealing to me, plus there are thin slices of “lap cheong” buried in there and I am mad for that.
