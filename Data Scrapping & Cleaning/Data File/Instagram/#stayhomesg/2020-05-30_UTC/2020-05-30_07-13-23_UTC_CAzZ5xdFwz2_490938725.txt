It’s the weekend again! It’s sometimes hard to keep track these days. Here at the Kow residence, we enjoy unwinding during the weekend with a good movie in the comforts of our in-house Gold Class. Especially now with the theatres closed, a movie room definitely comes in handy and the best part, it is not a hard task to achieve with a spare room and the Nic & Wes Lifestlye touch!
