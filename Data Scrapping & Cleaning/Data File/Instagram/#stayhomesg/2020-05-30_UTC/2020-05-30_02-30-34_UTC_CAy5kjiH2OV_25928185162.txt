Our Story | The Handyman⠀⁣⁣
⠀⁣⁣
While living alone, P would spend 3-4 hours every weekend doing the household chores. Without fail, that would always trigger her upper back to begin its chronic sharp searing pain (due to bone spurs). ⠀⁣⁣
⠀⁣⁣
After A moved in, he decided to take over most of the weekly heavy-duty chores. Like a handyman, he maneuvres around the room, cleaning efficiently while listening to podcasts on his Beats headphones. ⠀⁣⁣
⠀⁣⁣
There were a few times when P tried to help. ⁣
⁣
A: “Aiya you don’t help la. You so 小力 one. You just be princess can already.”⠀⁣⁣
⠀⁣⁣
P: “Aww does that make you the prince then?”⠀⁣⁣
⠀⁣⁣
A:” No, that makes me the slave.” 👨🏻‍🔧
