Viviane of @asweetmesssg was so sweet to deliver more of her homemade goodies yesterday. She shared that because of her love for all things Pandan, she adapted her Strawberry Shortcake chiffon-like cake batter to create this Gula Melaka Cupcake. I must say, the lady did an excellent job because it‘s wonderfully calibrated in terms of texture - soft, light and fluffy but with a degree of sturdiness to support the fried grated coconut with gula melaka coconut that makes up its filling. On top sits a dollop of cream frosting drizzled with gula melaka coconut milk syrup. This #cupcake needs to be eaten in a big enough bite so as to get a bit of everything at one go - that’s when “ding-ding-ding”, all the essential flavour and texture points are hit, and terrific scrumptiousness envelopes your senses.
As you can guess, I was very taken with it, as much if not more than I was with her Banana Bonanza Cake and Rainbow Ondeh Ondeh.
Do stalk @asweetmesssg if you want to get your hands on these or any of her other creations which I’m sure, are equally impressive.
