@arnoldsfriedchicken for lunch today. I ordered 1 spring chicken and also some chicken parts which comes with bun, fries and a choice of coleslaw or mash potato ðŸ¥”
.
The skin was crispy and meat was tender and juicy. Chicken parts were slightly more spicy than the spring chicken which is the kind of spice level I enjoy. The bun was delicious and I thought it might taste even better if I dip it in the mash potato gravy. Sadly, they missed out my order for gravy add-on.
