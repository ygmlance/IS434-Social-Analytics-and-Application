It came as a really major surprise when my song "承受” came into the Top #10 charts under iTunes Singapore on the same day it has been released! I was #11 on the evening, and got pushed up the charts at midnight. 🤣

I guess I have to thank all of you out there who had rushed in to download/stream as soon as it was out, and I am simply overwhelmed by the support! Definitely a milestone I would never have expected in my life. Of course, I know it can't remain as top #10 forever, so I've captured this as a momento! And if you have yet to download, please do feel free to do so and keep me on the charts for as long as I can live! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 HAHAHAHA.

Thanks to the lovely team for being a part of the milestone together!!! @amyrabadawn @voz_management
