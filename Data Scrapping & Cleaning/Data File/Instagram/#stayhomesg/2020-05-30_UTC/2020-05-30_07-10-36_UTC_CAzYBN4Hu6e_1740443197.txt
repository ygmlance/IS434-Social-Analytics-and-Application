Thank you @terrencetey1188 for constantly upskilling us during the circuit breaker/MCO period. In the past 3 months, you have run 34 zoom calls for us, with an average of 2 hours per call (some up to 4 hours). You've spent so much of your own personal time, choosing to share with us with so much passion and enthusiasm and really just wanting us to become a better version of ourselves. Thank you Terrence, for everything you've done for the @transforminnovategrow organisation! You truly lead by example and at the time where most companies are choosing to cut costs and to save themselves, you instead choose to fight for more and more opportunities for us, and constantly reassure us that you will be there for us. We love you and we appreciate you. Thank you TT! ‚ù§
