For ARPC Members & Regulars only ... Jesus told us to ask, seek and knock (A.S.K). We all have questions about God and faith or fear at home, school, work. 
Come chat & pray with Pastor Chris Chia as we transit into Safe Reopening, Safe Transition & Safe Nation as a Saved Church. 
June 6 (Sat) & June 20 (Sat) @ 8 pm
