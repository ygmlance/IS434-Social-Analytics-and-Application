Cotton Soft Two-tone Chiffon Cake üòç
A challenge with @shootandspoon and @shitty_vince to make this two tone chiffon cake! I'll make a video someday when I'm free meanwhile here's the recipe.

Ingredients
2 egg yolks 
2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp Vanilla extract
2 tbsp milk
2 tbsp oil
50 gr cake flour
1/2 tsp baking powder

2 eggs white (around 80grams)
3 tbsp sugar 
1/4 tsp vinegar

2 tsp cocoa powder 
1/2 tsp of charcoal powder (optical for extra color)
Alittle water

Beat egg yolks and sugar until fluffy.
Add in vanilla, milk and oil. Then stir in flour and baking powder. Set aside.
Whip egg white and vinegar until bubbly.
Then gradually add in sugar until stiff peaks.
Transfer a dollop of beaten egg white into the egg yolk mixture and mix well.
Combine both mixture together, folding in gently.
Once combined, divide batter into two and stir in cocoa mixture into the one of the batter.
Dollap them into a 6 inch chiffon cake pan.
Bake 140 degrees for 45 - 50 mins
Let it cool completely upside down. Then remove from mold and serve.
