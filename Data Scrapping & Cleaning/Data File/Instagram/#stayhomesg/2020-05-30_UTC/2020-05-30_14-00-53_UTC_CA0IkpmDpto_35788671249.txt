The holidays are almost ending, and although I can't wait to see my friends again, I'm also uncertain about school will be like with covid-19 precautions. I feel this picture perfectly describes my feelings now haha -- a little wistful but still enjoying life. ðŸ˜Š This picture was actually taken during the 2018 nov-dec holidays at Halong Bay, Hanoi. I can't wait till we can travel again!
Pic taken by my mum ðŸ“¸
