Skipping into the weekend like this. ðŸ˜Š
I used to detest skipping cos I suck at it - every few jumps, I would tripped on the rope and it made me feel so lousy.

This circuit breaker period has gotten me to fall in love with skipping as it is a quick way for me to get my heart rate up. Now I skip everyday. Then proceed on with some weight training.

Today marks the first day of me achieving 1,000 times of skipping. ðŸ’ª Sure felt good after! ðŸ”¥
