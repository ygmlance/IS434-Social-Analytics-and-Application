#B4IMGONEChallenge

It's Hiphop Saturday and today I'm posting Rapped entries! In light of what's happening in America right now, I'm sending love to all Emcees and Hiphop artists to use their lyrics to bring change - words are power! Check out the words of my brother from the Westcoast. 
Name: @sabotawj ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Country: USA, California 
Love me #B4ImGone:  Sabotawj is an MC and founding member of Buhay Cali. This artist hails out of Southeast San Diego, CA is a versatile songwriter and has written both and produced music from street anthems to soulful love jams. He is prolific, having released more albums that I can count and collaborated with artists like Hussein Fatal (2pac's Outlawz), Bo Roc of The Doveshack, Daz, King T, Craig G, Raekwon, DJ Bless, Blame One, Snowgoons, @DJSarasa and of course yours truly.  Tawj isn't about that Hollywood life, or riding the latest trends; he simply delves deep into a love for his lyrical art, and steadily creates music that contributes to his legacy. 
Masia's Fave #Sabotawj Song: '2 Be Alive' shows the true craft and  struggle of being an emcee and the decision to keep your head up. I also love our collabs "Daygo Evenings" ft. @JessicaKaya and "Luv Bout Ya Love" ft. Bo Roc, creating true love songs for the Hiphop head. ----
Sing your own cover for the song by @masiaone "You'll Only Love Me When I'm Gone" and tag @masiaone #B4ImGone ðŸ‘‘
