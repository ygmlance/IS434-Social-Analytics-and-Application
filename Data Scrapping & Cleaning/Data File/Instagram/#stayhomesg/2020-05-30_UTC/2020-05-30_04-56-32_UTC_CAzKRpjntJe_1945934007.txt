Nothing supersedes a run 🏃‍♀️🏃🏼‍♂️ .
.
Put on my favourite running attire and want for run with hubby earlier.  My last run was 6 weeks ago and great to run again.  Time to build & pick up my pace & mileage. .
.
A good 4.3km at a reasonably good pace.  I used an Adidas app to track my run today to join in the #hometeamherochallenge which Adidas will donate $1 to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the World Health Organization (WHO), with a goal of hitting one million hours which kicked off yesterday to June 7.

Doesn’t matter the choice of sport or discipline of choice, ability level, or current stage of coronavirus lockdown, Adidas’s #HOMETEAMHERO Challenge is a chance for us to do good (and feel good) as we show our gratitude for COVID-19 frontline workers.
.
.
Yeah... workout for a good cause and we abide the laws too... wear a mask before & after run 😝
