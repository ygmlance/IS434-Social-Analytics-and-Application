For the first time ever in my life, I successfully made some Chinese meat pies with minced beef and onion. A historical moment for me, finally I could trace back the flavour left by my dear parents. No matter how clumsy the pies may look like, I have never been so proud to be a self-made man at my 40s... in retrospect, my mommy told me at my childhood when I was eating the pies she made for me and praising her, “other than eating, you should learn to cook for yourself, else no one will help you once mommy left this world. ” Yes, it is so true. My daddy has left me for 15 years, then Mommy for 5 years. The moment I bite my pies, everything came back as if we three are together, again.
