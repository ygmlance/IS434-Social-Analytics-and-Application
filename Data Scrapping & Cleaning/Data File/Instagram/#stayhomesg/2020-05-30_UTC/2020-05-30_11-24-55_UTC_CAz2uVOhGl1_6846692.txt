Lunch was having Vietnamese vegetarian spring rolls. In place of regular prawns, this time I used pan fried tofu instead. These healthy spring rolls went so well with the creamy peanut butter dipping sauce! 🌸🌼🌻🌿🍃 #circuitbreaker day54 #stayhomesg #vegetarian #springrolls #lunch #asianfood #marksandspencerfood #peanutbutter
