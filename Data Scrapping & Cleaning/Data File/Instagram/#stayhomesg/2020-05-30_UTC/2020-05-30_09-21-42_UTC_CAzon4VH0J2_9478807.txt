Alright, probably the last outfit I'm sewing for the girls during this #circuitbreaker. Run out of fabric would love to add a #waistband, well we can wait till June since we have no where to go to. Would love this more if the dress is in full white.
Nonetheless I had fun sewing these dresses for my girls and it's gonna be a memories when we look back in years. Love u both so much ðŸ’–ðŸ’–
