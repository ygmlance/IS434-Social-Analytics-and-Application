@redchefasia Spicy Sakura Prawn Soup Noodles. I wasn't disappointed when I saw the paste within after the amazing experience with MyKuali prawn cup noodles , and true enough pastes create a delicious soup that's really spicy and fragrant and thick. Enough for two bowls.
And I added the very versatile frozen oysters again.
BTW I didn't know before this that @theramenrater was a thing! Even on the wrapper!
