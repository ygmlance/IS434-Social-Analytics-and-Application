#B4IMGONEChallenge

The last one for Hiphop Saturday while the world is burning & standing up against injustice. 
Name: @noyz134 ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ Country: Malaysia 
Love me #B4ImGone:  Noyz is what happens with someone who loves Hiphop as a culture and not just as a 'fashion', and developed his skills in the elements of Graf and MC'ing. With his art, Noyz has a flair with  lines, from paper to the wall mural, conceptualizing characters and bringing them to life in his own unique style. Over the past years, he has worked on projects with Gap, Expedia, and had the chance to paint a wall for King Kawahu Restaurant in Taiwan. I used to hear Noyz kick freestyles at Starsound Studios in Klang, and his poetics would go on forever. At some point I would realize that the incredible wildstyle mural behind him, was also his creation.  If I would exclaim "Holy s*%# you're talented" he would always reply, "No lah, just having fun." This is the last of a dying breed and a facade of Hiphop culture I must champion #B4ImGone. ----
