Here’s a snippet of the latest song called “STAY HOME” thats dropping.

Video link is in my bio.

This song was inspired by @universalmusicsg - Stay Home and I thought to myself, why not try to do another version of it? So I ended up combining forces with @vessail & @ralphalvern to deliver this masterpiece.

The song is basically enforcing the idea of the importance of staying home amidst the epidemic while also giving gratitude to the ones dedicating themselves to saving the lives that are affected. I hope you guys will check it out and enjoy the lyric video that comes with it!
