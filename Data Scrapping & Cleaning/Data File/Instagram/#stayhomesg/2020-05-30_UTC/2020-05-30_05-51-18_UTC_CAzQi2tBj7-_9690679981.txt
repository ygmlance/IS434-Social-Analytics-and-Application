LISTEN, let them finish FIRST then respond. 🤚Not talk back or interrupt them. Be silent and listen. 👊Yes, you heard it a billion times (that means you have or have not done it a billion times, no?)⁣

The objective here is to stop their nagging. It will not change overnight, you wouldn’t also. Show her that you are making an effort to communicate. They will understand what you are doing, SLOWLY. IF the frequency and intensity reduces, it’s a WIN already!⁣🤟🤟🤟

Understand that they are the only ones that care, that's why they nag. Don’t be fake, condescending or even belittle them when you respond. Sit them down (dining table?), or find a place where both of you cannot take an aggressive stance. Remember your goal here. STOP the nagging? Lessen it, maybe. For the WIN, ok?⁣🤟

I am not a child nor parent expert. It's just that I have worked with many teenagers and parents over the years in a private setting (mainly home tuition) that I have seen such challenges caused negativity in some of my past students. And that had reduced their effectiveness to concentrate or cause morale issues. I hope I can reduce some stress for you, you know who to share these to, right?⁣😆😆😆
