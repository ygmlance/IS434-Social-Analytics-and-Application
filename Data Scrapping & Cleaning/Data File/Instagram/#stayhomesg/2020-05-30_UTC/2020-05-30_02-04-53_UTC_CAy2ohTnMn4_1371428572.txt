We are now 8 weeks into CB since 7th April. The endless online delivery of the daily necessities to you has slowly become a norm of our daily operation. The Bakers worked relentlessly 24/7 to keep the supply going, bringing you the best French goodies to your doorsteps. And thanks to the Farmers in France and @bellotminoteries where our flour are shipped from. Thank you!
