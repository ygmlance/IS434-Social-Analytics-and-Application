Quick photo before I rush off to run  errands! These are three of my current fave flavours this season. Some call this their magic powder and I think it's pretty apt.❤️ The most obvious benefits I've had these few months were that I've broken the plateau in my weight loss and am at the lightest I've been in years, been sleeping better, have better energy to deal with work (no mid afternoon crashes) and better performance at my exercise classes.

And yes, it's Freebie Saturday! We've seen quite a few Singaporean winners  and I really do hope you'll be next, if you're still reading this! Haha. Really have to try it to know what I'm trying to say!
