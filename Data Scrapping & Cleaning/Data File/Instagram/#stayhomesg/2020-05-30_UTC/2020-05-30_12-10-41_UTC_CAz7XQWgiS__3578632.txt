in just 5mins. 
I understand that because of Covid-19 pandemic many businesses have disruptions and facing a steep drop of sales . ⁣
⁣
Hence , I decided to share some of my tips with you guys today and I hope that this can help you guys to improve your online sales tactics. ⁣
Especially those who just moved from traditional biz to online biz and those micro business bosses out there who are lost on doing sales. ⁣
⁣
I have learnt a lot along the way through these 5yrs experiences on doing micro business . I have been doing sales script for my bosses to help them get sales all these while.⁣
⁣
Developing a strong sales program is the most critical aspect of any business. Without effective sales strategies, companies will not be able to compete and grow. Sales professionals must learn how to implement proven sales tactics that work. These sorts of sales tactics do more than just help them to close individual sales; they help to generate additional prospects for future sales too. ⁣

💛Share this to your friends who are doing business/online sales and let’s help them get through this tough time! 💪🏻⁣

Anyway, side note... ⁣
I personally have received many dms from insurance agents all these while, and some of their sales scripts I really 看不下去😢 I have attached one of the screenshot in the video, not to fame them but I think they really can do better and that is one of the most turn off scripts to me. ⁣
I hope that no one will make the same mistake as the person and never make your potential customer feeling turn off. ⁣
