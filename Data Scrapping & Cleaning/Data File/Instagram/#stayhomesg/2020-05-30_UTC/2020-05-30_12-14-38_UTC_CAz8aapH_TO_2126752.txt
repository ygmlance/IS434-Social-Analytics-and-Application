@joopboutique always say that my “pattern more than badminton”! 😆haha! 🤣 But truly, this has been my type of #StayHome sports for the past 2 months – electrocuting insects with my loyal bug killer racket! 🦟💥PAM!
.
This Cobalt Blue L’amour De Vie Dress brings so much great energy and refreshing vibes! Also love the adjustable drawstring waist skirt (so you still can wear the same dress even if you grow horizontally 10x, or even as a maternity wear). Can’t wait to matchy matchy this number with my gorgeous sister @sugar73 (check out her OOTD in the same piece in black)!
