This week, one of our local staff members made nikujaga (肉じゃが)! Nikujaga, as its name suggests, is a Japanese home-cooked dish that consists of meat (肉 ‘niku’) and potatoes (じゃが ‘jaga’). 🍖🥔 Although sliced beef is the most commonly used in Japan, sliced pork is said to be used more often in homes in eastern Japan. ⁣

For this version of nikujaga, our staff stir-fried thinly sliced pork, roughly chopped potatoes and carrots, onions, and mushrooms in a pot. Water, soy sauce, mirin, cooking sake, and sugar is added and the ingredients are left to simmer on a low heat. (Usually, dashi and shirataki (konnyaku noodles) are added to nikujaga but if you don’t have these ingredients, you can still make the dish without these like our staff did.) After 20~30 minutes, the meat and vegetables soak up the delicious taste of the sauce, making a tasty stew. With lots of vegetables and a clear soup, when served with white rice, the stew makes for a hearty but light lunchtime meal! ⁣
