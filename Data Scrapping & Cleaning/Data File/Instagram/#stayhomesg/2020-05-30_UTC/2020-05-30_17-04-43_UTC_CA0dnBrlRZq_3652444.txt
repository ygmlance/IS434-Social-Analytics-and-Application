My first attempt of no yeast, no knead #pandesal and it was baked using toaster oven. I got this recipe from youtube. The taste is good but I think I need to modify the measurement (since Iâ€™m using a different brand of flour) to get the right shape and texture. Practice makes perfect and once I perfect this, will share the correct measurement! ðŸ¤—
