@lwleong and I had fun jamming this song a couple days ago and thought we’d try recording too it for keepsake :) This is such a beautifully written song by legendary Joni Mitchell. I first heard it when I was little and was enchanted by its tune, but I never truly understood the lyrics until lately because of y’know, #lifelessons. Hope you guys’ll enjoy our little rendition! Not perfect but we do hope it’ll warm hearts :)
