[Long post ALERT]

This has gotta be the most tiring week of the entire Circuit Breaker!

But I am glad that Iâ€™ve finally gotten into the groove of working from home with a productive routine. Iâ€™m actually liking it hahah! Not sure whether itâ€™s a blessing that we need to go on with WFH despite the lifting of CB in June 2.

As tiring as it was, it was fulfilling to accomplished so much in a short week and at the same time helped a couple of my friends & clients with their goals for the future.

To be frank, everyone have goals and actually know their WANTS fairly well, the challenge lies in HOW to get there.

With the help of a fantastic software, everyone that went through it got clarity and know EXACTLY what they need to do to reach their WANTS. - ALL WITHIN an hour.

Not only they know what they CAN achieve, they know what they have to STOP doing if they want it bad enough.

I guess, this has made me realise why I enjoy going for fortune telling/geomancy consultations. Because, I walked out every single time knowing exactly what I need to do and what to avoid for a brighter future. It brings hope, and hope brings directions which results in positivity. And to me, paying to get myself out of a rut is worth every penny.

What about you guys? Do you go for such consultations? (Or am I the weird one here?) #sgmoney #sgentrepreneurs #sgentrepreneurship #sgentrepreneurlifestyle #workfromhomesg #sgbusiness #sgbusinessowners #sgventure #sghomebusiness #motivationsg
