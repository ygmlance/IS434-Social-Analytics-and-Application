‚Å£‚Å£Gnocchi, this version uses no egg so the dough is a huge pain in the ass to work with because it's very brittle, but the upside is that you'll get the fluffiest, lightest gnocchi, almost like eating a pillow of soft mashed potato‚†Ä‚†Ä

-Microwave or bake your potatoes‚†Ä‚†Ä
-Push the potato through a ricer ‚†Ä‚†Ä
-Pass it through a tamis(this is really tough because the potato is meant to be really dry, but this makes the gnocchi really smooth)‚†Ä‚†Ä
-Transfer it onto a floured surface and press it flat, sprinkle a layer of flour and the fold the dough into the flour, then press it out and repeat until it comes together. The less flour you use, the lighter the gnocchi will be, but the harder it will be to handle ‚†Ä‚†Ä
-Roll it out into a weird sausage and cut it into bite sized pieces. You can use it as is or roll it on a gnocchi board‚†Ä
-Boil in salted water and sauce itüòå‚†Ä‚†Ä
