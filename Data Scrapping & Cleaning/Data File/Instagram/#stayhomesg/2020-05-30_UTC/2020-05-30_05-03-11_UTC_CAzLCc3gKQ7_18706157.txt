Day 54 into the circuit breaker. .
Countdown to the second last post of my circuit breaker daily sharing project. Thanks for all the comments and likes over the days. I will get back to the #3pixweekly after the circuit breaker. .
During the circuit breaker, many things had happened to me. I had changed the job, running over 100km per month, and Netflix a lot more. .
Finally, I wish all remain strong and positive for the coming phase 1. And look forward to the shops and restaurants opening in phase 2.
