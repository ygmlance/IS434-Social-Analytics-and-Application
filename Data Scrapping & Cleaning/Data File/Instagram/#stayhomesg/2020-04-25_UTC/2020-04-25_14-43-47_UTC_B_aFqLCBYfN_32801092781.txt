Circuit breaker Day 19: @theburningoaksg rice bowls👍👍👍 Ordered beforehand & drove to Bedok to pick these bowls up! Sooooo good the:
- 10hr slow cooked pork (so tender!) &
- truffle mince (this on rice is really all you need).
Beef skewers were real smoky & tender, piece of foie gras was huge too. Portions are super value for money, taste is on point, love that they’re located in a hawker centre! Definitely will order again. (If you don’t eat that much should tell them less rice!)
📍The Burning Oak (Bedok Rd)
