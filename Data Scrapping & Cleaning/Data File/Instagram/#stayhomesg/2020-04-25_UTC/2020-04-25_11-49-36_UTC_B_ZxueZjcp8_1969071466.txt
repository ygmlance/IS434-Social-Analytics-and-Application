How’s everyone? What have you been doing lately? Hang in there. Stay home stay safe! There are many things to do while staying home. I have tried out some recipes I saw online and today I tried to make my 1st face mask following a tutorial. The nose part doesn’t really fit my nose. May be I should try another tutorial that has the wire sewn.😊👍🏻 I’m using loose pieces of Batik that I have. I bought the sewn on interfacing as filter as suggested by the fabric shop. #batikmask #handmademask #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomesg
