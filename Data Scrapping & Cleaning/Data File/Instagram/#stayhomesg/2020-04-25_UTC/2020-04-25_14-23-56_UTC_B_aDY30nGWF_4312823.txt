Happiest in the kitchen when I'm doing my stuff & totally in my own zone. Grooving & singing along to music without caring if I am in tune.

Today I did everything with joy & love. 
Today I realised that, I managed to unblock a part of me, the part of me who loves being loud and fun.

Today I reclaimed back a part of me. The part which got lost in the mist of life.

Today, I also missed my chef uniform. üåù . .
