Raise your hand if you’re tired of planning your meals every day. No sooner are you done with getting lunch sorted, you have to start planning for dinner. Not to worry – we can bring our hearty and wholesome food directly to your door and take all the hassle out of cooking this #stayhome weekend. From this uber flavourful and comforting Skillet Baked Eggs (our all-time favourite by the way) to our nourishing Smashed Avocado Tartine, we’ve got you covered.
If you are located near our outlets, you can have our food and coffee delivered to you via our delivery partners, @grabfoodsg, @foodpandasg and @deliveroo_sg. If you are located outside their delivery radius, don’t fret, we can deliver island-wide with just a minimum order of $25. Hit the link to order! Also available for takeaway from our outlets except Millenia Walk outlet. ⠀
