ðŸ’­ From the lanes of Singapore â€¢ Re-created Gulabo ~ our fav gin cocktail at @flyingmonkeysg.
Why use one gin when you can use two ðŸ˜‰
Homemade strawberry infused gin @hendricksgin and #musgravegin from South Africa. Bonus points to this gin for the rose water notes ðŸ’•
The gin concoction gave us this beautiful pink hue hence decided to skip @hamdardroohafza 
Used @schweppes tonic water for little hints of sweetness and @polarseltzersg lemon seltzer for that extra lemony zing.
Serve it in a tall glass, high ball style like we did in our go to choice of drink ware from  @villeroybochsg
