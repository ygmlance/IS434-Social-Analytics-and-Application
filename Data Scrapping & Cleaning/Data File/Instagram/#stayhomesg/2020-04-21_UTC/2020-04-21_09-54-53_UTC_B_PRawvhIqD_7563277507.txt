Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy! We are excited to share that we are launching our Stay Home Art Kit inclusive of delivery/courier service - to keep our little picassos' creative juice at home flowing while practicing social distancing. One Art kit costs $25 each, which can deduct 1 session at $25 from one term package to purchase 1 art kit. We will deliver or courier it to you within the next 2 to 3 working days. We have online FREE art tutorials on our Instagram & Facebook to work on these crafts so the kids can download and paint at home! Do let us know if you like to purchase any (Set A or Set B) and we will deliver it to you within the next two days. :) We only have limited supplies on the first batch!  #stayhomekit #photooftheday #creativity #artkit
