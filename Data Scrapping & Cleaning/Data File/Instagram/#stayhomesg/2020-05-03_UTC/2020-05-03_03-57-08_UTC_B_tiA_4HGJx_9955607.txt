Weekend baking - blueberry yoghurt muffins, a low sugar recipe from @scrummylane . Instead of greek yoghurt, I had used meiji, natural flavour. Worked pretty well, super fast and quite a foolproof recipe. Halved the quantities to make 6 muffins. The carbon steel muffin pan from Redman was nonstick enough for me not to have to use any liners, just some oil. #sgunited #stayhomesg #blueberrymuffins
