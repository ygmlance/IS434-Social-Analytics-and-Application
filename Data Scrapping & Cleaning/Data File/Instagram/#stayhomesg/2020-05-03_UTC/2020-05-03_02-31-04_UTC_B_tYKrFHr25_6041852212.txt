Low energy these few days

My first attempt at fried noodles (chow mien) for lunch. Added in sliced capsicum, carrots and minced pork

Dinner was pork ribs bitter melon soup with some air fried nuggets and fried eggs with onions and tomato

Highlight for the day: My boy actually loves the bitter melon soup.
