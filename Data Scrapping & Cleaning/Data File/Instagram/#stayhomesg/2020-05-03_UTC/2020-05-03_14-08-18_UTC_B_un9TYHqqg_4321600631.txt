[CHUN TSUBAKI PREMIX] Mum's the word with Mother's Day coming up in just a week, so how about cooking mum a meal to pamper her for a change? If you don't know where to start, our Nori Cereal Furikake is a good starter, great for breading proteins like prawns, chicken or even tofu! The best part? Working together with @gen_lxn, part of our profits goes to supporting Migrant Workers. Shop now via our link in bio and get it delivered to your home! #chuntsubaki #refineandredefine
