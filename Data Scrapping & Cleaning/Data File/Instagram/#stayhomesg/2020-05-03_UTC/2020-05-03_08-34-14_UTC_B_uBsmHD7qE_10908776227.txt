april 2020 challenge 2/3 
as part 1 of our quarantine ends and part 2 begins tomorrow, here's me looking back at the challenges that kept me (and some friends) occupied in the past month - also leaving this here for others to try!
--
this pullup version of the #toiletpaperchallenge was from watching people balance toilet rolls on their horses (search the hashtags) and since I didn't want to put an unused toilet roll on a sweaty head, I used a cup instead:
1. balance something that you have in abundance on your head
2. do 3 pull ups
