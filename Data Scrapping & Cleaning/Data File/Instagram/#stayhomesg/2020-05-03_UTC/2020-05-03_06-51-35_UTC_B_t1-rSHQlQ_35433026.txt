Afternoon coffee break with the hubby. I'm not usually a coffee drinker but since I can't get my hands on bubble tea, coffee it is. I chanced upon @kopiboy.sg's IG story and was immediately enthralled by it. We tried the authentic kopi, caramel latte and smooth latte - but our favourite hands down is the authentic kopi (Thank God I ordered a large bottle of that) One of the things we like is that the coffee wasn't too sweet, and we could better taste the roast this way. Thumbs up - would totally order this again!
