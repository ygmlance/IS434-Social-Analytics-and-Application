Since we can't go out for a picnic, we brought the picnic home.

Prepared some fillings (salmon spread, egg mayo, cucumber and tomato) for the croissants. Added in blueberries as the side.

Laid a small mat at home near to the window for us to do a home picnic.

Win-win situation for us. 
It got my boy really excited as he loves to go for picnics at the parks. He finished his lunch and fruits smiling. For me, I didn't have to prepare much except for the fillings and I got a breather from the usual cooking
