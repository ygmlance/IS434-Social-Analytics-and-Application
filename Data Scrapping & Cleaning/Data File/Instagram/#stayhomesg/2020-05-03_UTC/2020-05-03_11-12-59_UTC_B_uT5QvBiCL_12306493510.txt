popeyes !!! biscuits 🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪/5
even tho kfc has bttr fried chicken as compared to popeyes (bcos of kfc's fried chicken's seasoning/spices), i still insisted on ordering this as i LOVE popeyes' buttermilk biscuits !! it's soooo buttery, warm, fluffy and kina salty which perfectly complements the sweet strawberry jam 😩♥️ cajun fries 🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟/5
just the perfect amt of seasoning on each  stick/fry/fries haha!! fried chicken 🐔🐔🐔🐔/5
it's nubbad considering the tenderness of the chicken and all but i think the seasoning and the batter of their fried chicken still has rm for improvement 😙
