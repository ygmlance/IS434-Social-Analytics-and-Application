Songfa bakkutteh delivery (the other day) !! .
Their delivery service was very organise and love the fact that they gave us two extra packet of soups (in effort for their free flow soup!) I'm a lazy person that love the pork tenderloin as I don't have to use my hands to deal with the bones at the ribs hehe 🤪 plus points is that they give ALOT of meat!!! It was so much so filling 👍🏽👍🏽 Ohh and this is @foodkingnoc good too!!! .
