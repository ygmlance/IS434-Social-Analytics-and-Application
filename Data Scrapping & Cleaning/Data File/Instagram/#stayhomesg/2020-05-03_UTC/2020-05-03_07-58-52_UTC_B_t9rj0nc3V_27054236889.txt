Wholewheat Jaggery Cumin Cookies • A page from the childhood journal ~~ As an army kid, I have traveled the length & breadth of the country (India). Lived in metros as well as burbs that don't even show up on the map. Amidst this constant chaos (the good kind) we always found our footing in two spots - the local confectioner's shop and the town bakery 😄
Going to the bakery was my weekly highlight ~ the smell of baked goods tantalising 4 shops down, me making a mental list of all the things I'd ask my parents to buy and all the things we'd end up buying coz 'it's new, pls try' or 'this is hot outta the oven'. Full hands - full hearts 😍
While these cumin biscuits made guest appearances in our pantry I guess they found a permanent spot in my fond food memories. A little bitta sweet, a tad bit salty but always crunchy with hints of roasted cumin seeds ❤ I made these last week to share with the husband and now there are 2 cumin cookie lovers in this household 🍪
