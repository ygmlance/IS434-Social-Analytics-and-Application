Mother‚Äôs Day is coming & its time to show gratitude to Moms out there!
My mom raise me and my 3 sisters single handedly without help. It wasn‚Äôt an easy journey for her and it took me a while to understand. 
Now that I‚Äôm a mom, and there are many times and many months that I need do this hood with my 3 Maxi alone, even this CB period. But 1 thing for sure, I‚Äôm luckier than her, becuase I have her to help me all these while and she have her grandsons as companion now.
