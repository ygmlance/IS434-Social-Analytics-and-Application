Set B - Pork Chops, 1 Veg, 1 Egg & Rice, $6.50.⠀
⠀
Our food received was still hot even though it’s delivery. A strong aroma arises as we slowly open the nostalgic brown paper pack. We always find food taste so delicious when packed in brown papers rather than styrofoam boxes. Their signature Pork chops was still crispy, long bean were fragrant, sunshine egg were perfectly fried with watery egg yolk and everything was fully soaked in their signature Hainanese Curry gravy that’s so delectable! Every grain of white rice was fully infused with the curry and it’s not mushy at all. Definitely one of the food we missed so much during circuit breaker period and we are so glad that they are doing islandwide delivery! ⠀
