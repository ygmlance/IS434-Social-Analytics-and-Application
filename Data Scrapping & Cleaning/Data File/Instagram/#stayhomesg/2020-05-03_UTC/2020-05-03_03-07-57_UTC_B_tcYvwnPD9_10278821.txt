Been sometime since I get to dress up so I gotta snap some photos while I can! This circuit breaker had given me my alone time to reflect and realign my life, career, vision, passion & purpose together. Rarely we have such time in our entire life so gotta treasure well. Also, this digital painting we got for our house means a lot to Kazu & I, it represents the Lion of Judah that signifies majesty, dignity & power of God in our life. .
