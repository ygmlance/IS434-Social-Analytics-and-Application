SOUFFLÉ OMELETTE?!
And the theme for this week #CBfoodieSG is CURRY! All you need to make the Insta-worthy Soufflé Omelette are EGGS and I decided to add a local twist using ready-made Curry gravy (SGD 2) from @Foodyo_Cafe!
.
Steps
1️⃣ Separate the egg yolk and egg white
2️⃣ Whisk the egg white 1000 times (it’s called 1000 times Omelette in Korea)
3️⃣ Add in one-third of the beaten egg white into egg yolk and mix well
4️⃣ Pour in the rest of the beaten egg white quickly and mix well before the air bubbles disappear
5️⃣ Heat the pan at Low fire
6️⃣ Grease the pan with a little butter
7️⃣ Pour the egg batter in
8️⃣ Low heat for 3 mins
9️⃣ Flip it halfway and hold there
🔟 Finish with some curry sauce!
