Homemade paper birthday cake and we decorated our place with bunting and pompoms. We are still celebrating my dad's birthday with cheer through technology! And many thanks to @ollella_singapore for delivering their ondeh-ondeh cake on time. My dad had a real cake to make a wish and blow his candle. The kids all sang their birthday wishes to their grandpa and grandpa was really happy.
