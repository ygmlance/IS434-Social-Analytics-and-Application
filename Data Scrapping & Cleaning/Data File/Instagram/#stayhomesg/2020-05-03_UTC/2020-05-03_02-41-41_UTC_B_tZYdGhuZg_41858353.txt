‚Å£So far I've only been ordering food in on the weekend, it gives me something to look forward to and some semblance of time and what day of the week it is‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Yesterday was the biggest treat thus far- a takeaway pithivier from Odette, filled with pigeon, foie, and bresse chicken. It's served alongside truffled pomme puree, sauce Perigueux(Demi glac√© with truffle and Madeira), and a Kombu salad. ‚†Ä

Odette is currently running a #odetteathome plating competition with some really amazing top 3 prizes. It's actually a lot of fun... because let's be real, plating is the most fun when you don't have to do any of the mise en place üôÑ, also, when else will you get to see 3 Michelin starred food on your decades old Corelle dinnerware
