CP Food Delivery

During days when my mum feel lazy to cook, @cpfoodssg immediately came to my mind whenever I need to whip up a quick meal. Today’s lunch was CP Food’s ready-to-eat meals gifted by the ladies from @brandcellar during this stay home period - CP Glass Noodles with Baked Shrimp, CP Spaghetti with Chicken Sauce, CP Teriyaki Chicken with Rice and CP Japanese Crispy Gyoza. CP's frozen food retain their nutrients and flavours by using high tech freezing method and it was so easy to whip up a delectable meal.
