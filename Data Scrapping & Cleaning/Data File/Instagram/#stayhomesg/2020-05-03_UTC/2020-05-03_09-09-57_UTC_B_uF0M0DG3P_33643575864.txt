One of the questions that came up from yesterday's panel session was: how can one support a loved one battling mental illness, when the circuit breaker can't allow you to be there from them physically? 
In these times, we have to replicate social interaction through digital means, whether it's facetiming and eating dinner with that person, playing an online game, or watching a movie together. It's not quite an equivalent, but it is a way of showing that person that you are there if they need you. Offer your availability without judgement. There's no need to rush to give them solutions for any issues they're having, but just be that safe holding space for that person. 
You can catch the replay of yesterday's panel on our facebook page: facebook.com/calmcollectiveasia/ and make sure to sign up for next week's sessions which start at 2PM SGT on 9th May.
