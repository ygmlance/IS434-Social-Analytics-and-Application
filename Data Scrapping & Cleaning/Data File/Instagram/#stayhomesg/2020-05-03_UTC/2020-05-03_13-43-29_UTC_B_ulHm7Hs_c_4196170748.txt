Barre time bonding with my Mum! 💞 this #stayhomesg period has definitely allowed us to do more activities together like this awesome Webarre sesh!! ⁣

I love how it’s low impact and suitable for my Mum 🥰  try barre if you’re keen on something that’s low impact, but still works up a sweat. 💦 They are having a Mother's Day class as well!!😍 ⁣

Our instructor, Linda, who was able to smile through it all really made the difference. We were yelping halfway through core session and stayed on cos she was still persisting!! Your instructor matters for sure 😛 ⁣- 💓A ⁣
Have you tried barre before? :) ⁣ ⁣
