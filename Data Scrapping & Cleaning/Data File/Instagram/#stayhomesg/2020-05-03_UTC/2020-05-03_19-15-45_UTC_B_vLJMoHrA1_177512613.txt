The kiddos had fun building the ANBOX MYHOUSE Art Board Playhouse from @bymoly.sg together the other day. Well if you have cardboard boxes around the house, you can probably diy one too. But these come ready cut with instructions and looked pretty cool too. Plus the kiddos can colour it whichever ways they wanted too. Might be worth getting during this period. Check it out at https://www.bymoly.sg/anbox-myhouse. I think preorder before 06 May and you can receive on 18 May.
