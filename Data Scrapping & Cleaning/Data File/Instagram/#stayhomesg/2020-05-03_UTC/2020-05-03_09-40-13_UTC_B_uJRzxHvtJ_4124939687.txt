â™¡Sliced Pork with Garlic Sauceâ™¡
è’œæ³¥ç™½è‚‰ - I miss having this delicious Sichuan dish when we are eating out. Just plain boiled pork slices then match it with cucumbers & drizzle with spicy garlic sauce! So yummy...ðŸ˜‹
.
I just use ready sliced pork collar that is used for shabu shabu, can also use pork belly. Prepare a pot of boiling water, throw in ginger slices n splash of rice wine. Cook abt 2mins or until cooked thru, drain n place on plate.

Spicy Garlic Sauce:
â€¢ 2 tbsp minced garlic
â€¢ 3 tbsp soy sauce
â€¢ 1 tsp sweet sauce â€¢ 1 tsp chilli oil â€¢ 1/2 tsp sesame oil
Mix together n drizzle over cooked pork. .
