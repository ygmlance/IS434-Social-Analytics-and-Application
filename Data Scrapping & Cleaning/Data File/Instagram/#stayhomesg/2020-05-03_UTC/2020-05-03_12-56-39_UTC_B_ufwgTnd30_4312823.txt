When it comes to chocolate cake, I really hate those overly soft & fluffy ones that tasted like cheap chocolate. I'm not picky, just.. particular.

This chocolate ganache cake I made today hits all the right spot. Soft, moist, fluffy yet not overly so. It has a good texture & very chocolatey. Definitely one of the better chocolate cake I ever had.

Shio pan was made using tangzhong method and was pretty good too. Just like my life, it could do with a little more crispy crust, butter and salt thou. ðŸ™ƒ .
