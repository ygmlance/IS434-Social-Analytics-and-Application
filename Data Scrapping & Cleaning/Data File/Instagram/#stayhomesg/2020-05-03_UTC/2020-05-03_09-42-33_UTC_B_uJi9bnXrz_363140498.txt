It's always nice to glam up the washroom & give it a new look with some flowers 💐in the form of an envelope floral box from @ellysera.florist.

Followed by taking a relaxing bath with @refreshwellness 💦Shower Filter. Besides the benefits of having smoother skin, it also removes chlorine & harmful metals from the water. Certified & tested in laboratories, proven to fight eczema.

Lastly, indulge in some face & body 🧖🏻‍♀️skincare with @chanel.beauty. Never neglect your skin regardless of your age.

I hope that you have now gotten some clues on how to pamper your mum on👩🏻 Mother's Day!
