Tagged by my mummy @joannepeh for her #stayhomewithjp Challenge 3 "Happy Feet". Took me a few days to think and plan what to dance. Inspired by jiejie @heyhihazelle and @gwenstefani. 
Not my best but #stayathome so I have alot of time to work on it. 
One of my fav quote #bestquote - If you hit a wall, climb over it, crawl under it, or dance on top of it.

So here's the goofy dance challenge 
1. Pick your favourite song
2. Upload a video of yourself dancing/moving to it. Feel free to use props 
3. Tag 3 friends who love music and dancing.  I am tagging @fangrong @boonhuilu @heyhihazelle to join me in this one.
