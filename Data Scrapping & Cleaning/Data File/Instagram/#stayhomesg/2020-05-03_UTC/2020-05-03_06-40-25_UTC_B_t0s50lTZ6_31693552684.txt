Was craving watercress soup, so glad I managed to make some ðŸ˜‹
.
The challenge with cooking is keeping up with the ingredients inventory, making sure there's enough yet not too much to prevent wastage. Add on the challenge of heading to the supermarkets during covid19 times or having to meet MOQ for online grocers...

Story behind the craving: I worked in Bugis for a good 8 years and we frequent a roast meat eatery called Alex Eating House. Seriously amongst the best roast meats I have had. They also sold watercress soup for $1.80 (I think). A worthwhile cheap buy while waiting out the crowd for the roast meats. .
