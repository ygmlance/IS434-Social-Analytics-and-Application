This post is part of our series for the duration of the Circuit Breaker measures to shine a spotlight on SingLit books that we find to be uniquely encouraging. If you already own the books, perhaps you might want to dig out your copies to read again. If you would like to buy your own copies or purchase for a friend, you can order it via our Facebook shop or WhatsApp. (Link in bio.)
