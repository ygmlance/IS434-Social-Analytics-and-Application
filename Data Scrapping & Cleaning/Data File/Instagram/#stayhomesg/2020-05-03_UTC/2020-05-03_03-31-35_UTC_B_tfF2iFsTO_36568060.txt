Yes. Today is Sunday and it is a work day for my son. We switch around the day. Monday shall be the day for house keeping. 
It  is  good to give thanks to the Lord , And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High; To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning, And Your faithfulness every night, On an instrument of ten strings, On the lute, And on the harp, With harmonious sound. For You, Lord , have made me glad through Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands. O Lord , how great are Your works! Your thoughts are very deep. A senseless man does not know, Nor does a fool understand this. When the wicked spring up like grass, And when all the workers of iniquity flourish, It  is that they may be destroyed forever. But You, Lord , are on high forevermore. For behold, Your enemies, O Lord , For behold, Your enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. But my horn You have exalted like a wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil. My eye also has seen my  desire on my enemies; My ears hear my  desire on the wicked Who rise up against me. The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those who are planted in the house of the Lord Shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bear fruit in old age; They shall be fresh and flourishing, To declare that the Lord is upright; He  is my rock, and there  is no unrighteousness in Him.
Psalms 92:1‭-‬15 NKJV
