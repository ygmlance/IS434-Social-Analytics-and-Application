april 2020 challenge 3/3 
as part 1 of our quarantine ends and part 2 begins tomorrow, here's me looking back at the challenges that kept me (and some friends) occupied in the past month - also leaving this here for others to try!
--
the biggest question here is: is it #pistonsquat or #pistolsquat? in any case, this most recent challenge I did was inspired by the winner of the @boulder_plus squat challenge and also because I haven't worn my climbing shoes in a month:
1. shrimp squat
2. piston / pistol squat
3. put on climbing shoe (or any footwear of choice)
4. repeat on the other side
