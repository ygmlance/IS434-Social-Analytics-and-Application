Circuit breaker Day 27: Chicken rice for the first time this CB 👍👍 Honestly not the kind to eat chicken rice every week & there is only one chicken rice champion for me (Tian Tian at Maxwell). There was nothing out of place with this one - chicken well cooked, skin light & not too much gelatin, chilli & ginger on point, lotus root peanut soup good. Generous portion & value for money - all this for $26.
📍Sam Leong Hainanese Chicken Rice (opp City Sq Mall)
