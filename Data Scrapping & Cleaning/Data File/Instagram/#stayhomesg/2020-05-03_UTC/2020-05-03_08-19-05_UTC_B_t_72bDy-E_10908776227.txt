april 2020 challenge 1/3 
as part 1 of our quarantine ends and part 2 begins tomorrow, here's me looking back at the challenges that kept me (and some friends) occupied in the past month - also leaving this here for others to try!

this deadhang version of the #tshirtchallenge came about because I couldn't really do a handstand and wanted to see how long I can hang onto a bar:
1. wear shirt
2. do 1 pull-up
3. take off shirt
4. do 1 pull up
