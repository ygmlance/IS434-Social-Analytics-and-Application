This Circuit Breaker Period has given me some time to try out some new recipes. It’s pineapple 🍍 season right now and it’s certainly great to grab one to make fresh pineapple juice on this hot day! ☺️ Learnt this Tempura Prawns recipe from Rosalina Kitchen ( 塔塔的厨房). It’s super easy to make. This Pina Colada drink was an impromptu job! 😂 lol. Tasted not too bad, could do with a little more sweetness next time. 🍹🌺
