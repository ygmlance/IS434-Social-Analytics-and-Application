What to do when you have 2 kids that need to do an assignment each for school?

Combine both!

Chloe is learning about the lifecycle of butterflies 🦋 in pre-school, so we folded butterfly origami shapes together.

Hunter’s assignment for his Primary 3 class was to create something nice for a classmate. So he folded dinosaurs 🦖

But of green scrap paper, bit of paint, bit of glue.. and voila! A wee “dinosaur world” in an ice cream tub, for Hunter to bring to school to give to his friend👌🏻
