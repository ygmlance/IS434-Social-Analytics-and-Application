3 May 20 [#CircuitBreakerSG Day 27] :: Thank you everyone for making time to come online for our First Unrehearsed All Spontaneous IG Live session today at 1.30pm! We had so much fun dramatising ROOM ON THE BROOM by Julia Donaldson for you and your children. I couldn't believe I actually perspired by the end of the play!
.
Here's the playback if you've missed it. The first 5 minutes was of us interacting with our viewers, talking about ours and their favourite Julia Donaldson books, introducing our casts and making silly faces. I personally do find it rather entertaining but if you'd rather skip that, just go straight to 5.25 onwards for the story!
.
We crafted our masks from scratch using drawing papers, crayons, colour pencils, straws and tapes! We scoured the home for props like laundry basket for our Witch's cauldron and extendable mop as the broomstick! It's super that we managed to go to the extend of breaking our "broomstick" into two *haha* I had a good laugh myself while doing it. .
Thank you for all your kind words of encouragement during and after the IG Live session! Ewan and Faye had lots of fun although they couldn't see you. Hope you parents got inspired by us with this new way of dramatising a storybook and bringing it to life!
.
Stay Home Stay Safe! Happy School Holidays!
