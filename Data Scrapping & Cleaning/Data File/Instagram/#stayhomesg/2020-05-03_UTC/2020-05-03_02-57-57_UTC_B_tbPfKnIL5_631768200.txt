Day 27 of Circuit breaker.
Home cooked pig trotter Mee Sua.
I used sweet potatoes organic Mee sua to fried.
I wake up blur blur on this rainy morning.
I forgot to add in my Favourite Lup Cheong. 😑 Alamak.
Nevermind, this is a two portion meal. I can save the next portion for dinner, with added lup cheong and omelette strips. As i still have balance canned of the pig trotter.
I only need to cook a sweet potato soup to go with.
Haha. Then my dinner will be settled. 不用烦。
