💐Let happiness be yours today as you find what brings you beauty... the fresh flowers on your table, the fragile seashell on your desk.💐 I continue buying fresh flowers during this CB period because they simply brighten up my day and kept me company at home. Is there any habits you continue to maintain despite working from home? 😍Today I am able to have freshly baked plain honey Madeleines 🥰(hehe..again) as I already prepared the batter last night. Pairing them with cute and pretty Khong Guan fancy gems biscuits and Mango tea in exquisite Noritake cup. After the fake Tai Tai afternoon tea, it’s time to put on my productive cap! Am intending to try another improvised version of the chocolate cake and release episode 2 of #miwastudytrip2017 @jrvacationsg 🤨🤓💪💪💪@jrvacationsg is another Japan travel blog that I have been co-managing for a while and it’s time for a revamp! Happy efficient Sunday! ✌️
