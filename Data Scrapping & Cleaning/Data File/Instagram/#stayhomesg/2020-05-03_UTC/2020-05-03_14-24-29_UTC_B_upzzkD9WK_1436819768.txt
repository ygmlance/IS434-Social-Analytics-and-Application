Almost forgot to snap this ,  everything put together finally for this Wanton Mee dinner. It's so easy to grab a takeaway of wanton noodles from the hawker stall that it's hard to believe that it  took so much effort to put this dish together from scratch , almost. It was wonderful I had @anais_pan_ 's help to wrap the wanton dumplings and mama @kimhoonivy made the sauce and put the noodles together and  at long last I could enjoy my green chilli pickles ! Gosh ,what a meal ! #circuitbreakerday27 #circuitbreakerchronicles  #stayhomesg #homecooked #combinedefforts #hawkerfare #sgfood #sgmummy #sgfamily #familymeals #sundaydinner #sgmum #sgfoodie #kolomee #puttogethertogether
