Sunday NOT BAKES: Sweet Corn Santan Custard. Some call it Sweet Corn pudding. Santan is a Malay word for coconut milk. .

Back in my grandmother time story - In the 80s or 90s there will always be school excursions, events etc etc and what I feel the school did to save cost (my theory here) was to ask the student to bring/donate food from home. Back then, most parent will cook good stuff for the kids to donate for the event. It became more like a pot luck party. Funny I donâ€™t remember bringing anything to school but I do remember eating all the good stuff my friends parents baked or cooked then skipped the event totally. We are all in it for the food. One of my favs was this simple Sweet Corn Custard Pudding. Is this dessert still a thing now? Sorry I anti-social also nowadays food all so atas liao.

Do you notice an increase in traffic outside? Is the circuit breaker over or what? We got so many grab delivery outside? Supermarket is crowded too with families going by and kids screaming getting candies. Do we need another PM speech to wake everyone up again? Just because thereâ€™s some changes, it does not mean life goes back as normal. Smlj la. .

Some people use milk for this but I used santan as Iâ€™m still lactose intolerant. If I had a choice, Iâ€™d rather go with the milk version ðŸ˜­ This still, though, taste good and best eaten cold. .

400 ml coconut milk (I used one box of 200ml and a box of water to dilute this. Do not use pure thick coconut from the box and expecting your food to be lemak. Thatâ€˜s overkill)
Sweet corn cream style (I used one whole box here)
300 ml water
Â¾ cup custard powder
Â½ cup sugar
