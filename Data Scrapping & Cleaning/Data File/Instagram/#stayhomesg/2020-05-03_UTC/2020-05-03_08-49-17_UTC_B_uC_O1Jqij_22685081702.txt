Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it’s breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you’ll get by.

If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile, and maybe tomorrow
You’ll see the sun come shining through for you.

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
Now’s the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what’s the use of crying?
You’ll see that life is still worthwhile 
If you’d just smile :) #smilenatkingcole #smile #stayhome  #stayhomesg #bedroomjam #sgmusic
