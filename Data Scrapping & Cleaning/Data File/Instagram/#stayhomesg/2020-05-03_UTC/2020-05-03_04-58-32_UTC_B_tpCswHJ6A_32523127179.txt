Chrysanthemum Pearls | Green Tea | Oolong Tea 🥤
.
🍴Overall ease: 7/10
.
🛒Ingredients:
5g chrysanthemum flower 
30g brown sugar (we prefer less sweet but feel free to use 40-50g)
100g tapioca starch
70ml water
Oolong & green tea
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process:
1. Add grounded chrysanthemum and brown sugar into boiling water. Stir until the sugar has dissolved
2. Add ~20g of tapioca flour and stir until it reaches a gooey texture
3. Remove from heat and add the remaining tapioca flour.
4. Work the dough into a smooth ball. Roll out into strips and then tiny pearl-sized balls.
5. Boil the pearls for ~20 minutes. Optional: boil again in sugar syrup for extra sweetness. 
6. Serve with your choice of tea 
Note: extra pearls can be kept in the freezer for a pretty long time
.
😋Taste: 8/10. The #chrysanthemumpearls were still good and chewy, despite cooking it from frozen. For our second attempt, we decided to use store-bought Authentic Tea House green tea and Pokka oolong tea; both have 0 sugar. We added honey and it accentuated the slightly sweet and floral pearls. Still can’t beat #bubbletea bought from outside (miss you @chichasanchen.sg!), but this will do to satisfy cravings during this period
