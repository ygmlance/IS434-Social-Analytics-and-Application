Many friends shared food they cooked they baked on social media in the past few weeks, my mum cooks so I don’t really cook. Today finally I cooked something decent myself during this cb, and it’s char siew!!!!
.
The meat, Iberico pork shoulder, was purchased from Singapore Home cook group buy, the marbling was great but still not fat enough if you want your char siew taste like 肥婆 char siew.
.

I used Dr. Leslie ieatishootipost recipe, great recipe, my char siew taste like bak kwa, I like! The only down side is the cut of the meat I used, should have 飞机肉 aka 不见天 (pork armpit) as mentioned in doctor recipe. .
