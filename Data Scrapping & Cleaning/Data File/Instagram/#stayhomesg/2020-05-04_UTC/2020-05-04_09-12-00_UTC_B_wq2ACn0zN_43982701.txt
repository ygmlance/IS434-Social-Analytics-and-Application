Healthier cookies for the constant snacking during this #circuitbreaker period. Granola cluster cookies, they are just granola (nuts, seeds, rolled oats) held together by some egg whites. Much neater to eat then granola, donâ€™t need a bowl, just pop one into your mouth when feeling peckish #granola #granolacookies #eathealthy #homebaking #singaporehomecooks #sgbakes #stayhomesg #sgeats #sgfood #stfoodtrending #burpple #8dayseat #stayhomecookingchallenge #sgfoodies #foodphotography #beautifulcuisines #feedfeed #f52grams #huffposttaste #buzzfeedfood #bonappetit #foodgram #eatclean #eatrealfood #seriouseats #gloobyfood #heresmyfood #foodstagram #quarantinecooking
