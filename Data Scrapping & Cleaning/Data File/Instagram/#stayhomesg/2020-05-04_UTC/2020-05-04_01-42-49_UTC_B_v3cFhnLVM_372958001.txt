4 May 20 [#CircuitBreakerSG Day 28] :: Today marks the last day of Home-Based Learning! May the Force [Fourth] be with You this May Holidays.

We asked ourselves if our son had been happy being stuck with us at home. Daddy doesn’t think #bigbro文’s been really happy because we’ve been nagging at him every day, many a times escalating to punishments for misbehaviours. I don’t know… so I looked back at his daily well-being check-in answers he’s required to fill in first thing every morning before HBL. .
.
It seems like he IS happy after all. .
.
1. “I woke up and felt Happy.” How fortunate it is for a child to wake up feeling unafraid of what the day might bring.
.
2. “I am Happy because I woke up when the sun rose.” *sigh* On school mornings, they’d dilly-dally to get out of the door. On weekend or even HBL mornings, I have my kids waking between 5.45am and 6.45am. On this day, he was happy he managed to sleep beyond 7am when the sun rose! .
.
3. “I am Happy because I can see an eagle everyday outside my window.” Whenever Ewan lifts his head from his work to take a breather, his feathered friend will always be there in the far greeting him back with its silhouette. .
.
4. “I feel Happy because my reward is to shower at the balcony.” Simple joys! I told the kids they will get outdoor play time equipped with soap, a water hose and swimsuits.
.
5. “I feel Happy because my mum always gives me P.E. even when there are no P.E. Lessons.” I look forward daily to our one hour of P.E. time as essential breaks in between problem sums, 习字, comprehensions and crankiness too.
.
6. “I FEEL EXCITED BECAUSE I GET TO WATCH A MOVIE TOMORROW EVENING!” I witnessed his very first Excited mood this entire HBL sesh! We definitely do not need cinemas to make a child happy.
.
7. “Actually, I feel sleepy but there is no Sleepy option.” There. This was that morning he woke up at 5.45am. What option did he click since there was no Sleepy option? Happy.
.
He is even Happy he gets to do SLS. I don’t know what made me take pictures of these personal thoughts but I think the mother in me wanted to capture his rawest feelings and hold on tight to them through the years that’ll soon pass.
