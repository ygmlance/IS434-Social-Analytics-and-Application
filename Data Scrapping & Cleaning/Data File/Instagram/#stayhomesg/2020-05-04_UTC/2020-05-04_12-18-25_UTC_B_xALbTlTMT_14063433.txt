FACETIME shoot with @mommy_nannan at 3am because itâ€™s morning in California ðŸ˜‚

One thing about doing face time shoot, it can be very tiring because the model have to adjust the angle & distance for you so you can snap! And at the same time you have to know how to direct your friends/models well if not itâ€™s very awkward. But besides that, it can be a very good time to catch up on old times since we canâ€™t travel to find our friends ~

Con side : quality can be pretty bad but I guess it trains your directing skills ðŸ˜‚
