This is the first post I am doing for @banleongwahhoe during this Circuit Breaker period in Singapore. In recent weeks there are so many choices daily on food delivery and when it comes to Tze Char, the first restaurant that comes to mind is this heartland stall at Casuarina Road. 
It would seem that whenever I’m there, my family and I do not need to look at the menu to decide what we want. It is always the “template” orders (@ewayiseeit correct or not?) “err.. chilli crab , .. sambal kangkong... har cheong kai.. 铁板豆腐”. Likewise when I ordered delivery, the dishes I ordered were predictably the same. .
Thank you everyone at banleongwahhoe for cooking our favourite dishes during this tough period. From Chefs to Helpers and even the friendly delivery uncle who delivered the dishes way earlier than the estimated time!! ..

【Tze Char (Chinese: 煮炒; pinyin: zhǔ chǎo (zhú chǎo); literally: 'cook and fry'), also romanised Zi Char, is a Hokkien term used in Singapore to describe a Chinese food stall which provides a wide selection of common and affordable dishes which approximate home-cooked meals.】
