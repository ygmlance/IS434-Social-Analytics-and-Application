4 May 2020. Heyy its me again! After 3 weeks of training and 1 complete rest week (with the exception of messing around on the bar and hangboard) i decided to test my progress. 
1-arm pull-ups: much easier to do now, but i can't seem to get my chin cleanly over the bar yet. Left is obviously weaker and still needs work. 
1-arm chin-ups: terrible because i still need the swing to get up. Likewise, my left needs work. ðŸ˜”

Front Lever: Horrible ðŸ˜‚. I couldn't even hold it up. On the bright side, i can hold the one-legged version pretty good. Looks like i'm on the right track for this. 
Guess its time to continue the training.
