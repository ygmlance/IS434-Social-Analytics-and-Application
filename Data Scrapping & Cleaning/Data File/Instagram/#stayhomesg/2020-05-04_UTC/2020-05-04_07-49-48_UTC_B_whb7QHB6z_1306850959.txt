☘️One small surprise...A letter. A lost thing found. Kindness from a stranger. A skein of geese strewn across the sky. Celandines in the ditch. A perfect batch of scones. A ring around the moon. ☘️ I think the nicest surprise would be to find an item which you thought was lost. I’m still hopeful that I can find my two pretty and precious Hello Kitty and Jill Stuart beauty travel toiletries bags... they have been missing for almost 5 months. 🤣Anyway, today’s biggest surprise is that the KFC American Twister is not nice. 😞Maybe I should have selected the Original Twister (with colonel chicken) instead of the ang mo bacon one or maybe I should downplay my expectations (but then again, I took super extra efforts to travel to Northpoint City KFC to pick up the items as delivery only starts at 12pm). 😓Nevertheless, the saving grace was the extra egg tarts which I ordered. Still yummy! Also, I bought more versions of Starbucks 3-in-1 coffee to try. 😚 So, in the end, I still managed to put together nice breakfast set-up paired with Starbucks 3-in-1 cappuccino though I wish it tasted as good as it looked. 🤣 Maybe I should try Burger King or Subway breakfast next.
