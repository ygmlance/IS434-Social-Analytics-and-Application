As our regular followers, this is no surprise.  This is still our most favourite Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee stall! It’s fried till wok hei fragrant shiok with a nice aroma. Their version is the dry kind and with yellow and thin bee hoon! Heavenly goooooood even when we tapao it back home! Squeeze in lime, stir in their sambal chilli & chilli padi, give it a good stir and let the flavours tease your tastebuds!⠀
