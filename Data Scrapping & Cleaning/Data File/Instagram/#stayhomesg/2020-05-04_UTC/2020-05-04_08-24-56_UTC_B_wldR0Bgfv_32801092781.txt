Circuit breaker Day 28: Dry ban mian $4👍👍 Aesthetics is a 0, but at least it tastes good! Good for a dry ban mian, noodles surprisingly not that soggy yet when dabaoed & soup was tasty. But I have had better dry ban mians that offer their own drier chilli when tossed. Ordered the Rojak next door too, a tad on the sweet side.
📍A1 Handmade Ban Mian (Macpherson Lane)
