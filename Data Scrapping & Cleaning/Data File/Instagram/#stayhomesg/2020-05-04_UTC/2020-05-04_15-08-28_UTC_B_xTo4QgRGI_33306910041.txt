On Saturday night (2-May-2020), our son drew a self-sustained #caravan (a home that is movable from the harm of any #secondhandsmoke) equipped with a #tripledeckerbed (perhaps inspired from visits to @ikeasingapore in 2019), a playground with a #monkeybar and a slide that allows one to go a level below without having to take the stairs, a #rooftopgarden, a mini swimming pool, two football goal posts to accommodate his little sister, mother, grandmother, his pet (fish) and himself. The caravan is robot-driven. I wonder how his multi-decks caravan will be able to travel beneath overhead bridges;  yet the innocence and imagination of childhood made me optimistic. I am also thankful that his little sister tried to emulate what he did, by drawing her pink version of caravan. He himself has been inspired by #AntoniGaudi since he was 4 years old; the #architect himself was inspired by #motherNature and God. Our prayer also goes to people in Spain, where the number of cases rank 2nd worldwide as of 4-May-2020 (May the Force be with the world to survive this pandemic). Hope that our son could visit Barcelona again, bringing his little sister to admire the #GaudiArchitecture and contribute (albeit in a tiny amount) to the completion of the #LaSagradaFamilia.  #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious
