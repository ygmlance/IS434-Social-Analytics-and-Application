Circuit Breaker Day 28:
.
LAST DAY OF HBL!!!!
.
Thank you teachers for being very patient with me as I juggle work and trying very hard to complete the SLS and Koobits assignments #jsps
.

Thank you to the preschool teachers for your time for online learning. You really engage them despite only for an hour. They just want more! #ppisprc2
.

A silent appreciation to my Boss who I know understands the challenges working moms go through during this time. Thank you for guiding and accommodating. .

Thank you to my helpers who watched over the younger 2 kids while mummy is busy juggling it all.
.
Thank you to my husband of course for keeping me sane during this HBL period, giving me light Wife Duties and my time-out sessions.
.
Thank you for setting up our study and work stations every morning.

After today, mummy will be more focused with work and we will only do light revision for May Holidays. .
