Finally first time I think my bread making has turned out somewhat decent . Attempted a whole-wheat brioche loaf today (Trying to be healthier then getting the ones outside) and turned out pretty well, perfect with my left over bacon butter from Cure restaurant. Perfect also for soaking up the yummy sauce from home cooked prawn and tomato stew, served with a spicy herb salad - from Falastin cookbook by @ottolenghi. That said I still enjoy baking cakes rather then bread for sure! .
