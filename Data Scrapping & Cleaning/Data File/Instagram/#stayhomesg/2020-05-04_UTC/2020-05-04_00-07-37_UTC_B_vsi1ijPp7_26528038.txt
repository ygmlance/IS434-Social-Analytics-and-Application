Banana bread did not fix all the problems like the bloggers said it would. 🍌 .

False advertising. I was still upset after eating nearly an entire loaf by myself. And then nauseous. But at least I had delicious banana bread to eat under the blanket on the couch. And because it has bananas in it it’s basically a health food so I called it breakfast for the kids. They will be fine. I’ll try baking a cake and see if that fixes the world. Worth a shot. 🤷🏼‍♀️✌🏻
