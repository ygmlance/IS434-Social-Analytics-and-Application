(Family physical/. psychological well being.)\n3.  Family bond/upbringing/  Environment.\n\nThus, when any 1 of these 3 factors emerged is likely to cause chaos.\nNow, these 3 are happening at simultaneously. \nTogether with movement confinement, it\u2019s \u201cadding fuel to fire\u201d.\nTo overcome this is to keep oneself occupied with their respective activities. \nI switched my mindset to \u201cPatience Reflection and self-cultivation\u201d.\nWhatever one may do, KEEP CALM & DO NOT THROW TEMPER. \nAll will be well.\n\nCherish what we have, who we have. For if it is lost it will never be back, no point crying over spilled milk.\n\nCheers, Keep Strong and contented.\n\u4eba\u751f\u65e0\u5e38\uff0c\u77e5\u8db3\u5e38\u4e50 \u4e5f\u2764\ufe0f",
