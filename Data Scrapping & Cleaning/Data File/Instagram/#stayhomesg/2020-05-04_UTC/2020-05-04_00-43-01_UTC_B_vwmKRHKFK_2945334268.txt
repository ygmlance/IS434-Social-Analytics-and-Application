⁣
Hanjuku Egg / Ni-Tamago / Ajitsuke Tamago /  Ramen Egg.⁣
⁣
Bring pot of water to a boil. Ensure adequate water to completely submerge the eggs.⁣
Dunk eggs straight from the fridge into boiling water.  Reduce heat to a simmer.⁣
⁣
6 minutes later, remove eggs and plunge them straight into ice bath to stop the cooking process.⁣
⁣
Marinate bath. 3 parts water : 1 part light soya sauce : 1 part mirin : 0.5 part dark soya sauce : 0.5 part sugar. ⁣
Boil to dissolve sugar and then chill.⁣
⁣
Deshell eggs gently.  This is when you can tell if your eggs will make it.  If the white is formed but soft (and not hard like in hard boiled eggs), then likely you are okay. ⁣
Dunk eggs into marinate.⁣
⁣
Leave overnight.⁣

Deeply satisfying to see the yolks turn out right.⁣
Probably much easier and maybe cheaper to just get them from the shops, although this was kinda fun to make. ⁣
⁣
Just past the halfway mark for Circuit Breaker, and it does feel rather miserable already.  Clusters are still popping up, and even though community cases are down, it is not consistently single digit number.⁣
⁣
I am getting more and more regular virtual meals arranged with friends.⁣
Do we really need to get used to catching up with friends over Zoom meals?⁣
⁣
Cannot! Wo bu yao!⁣ ⁣
