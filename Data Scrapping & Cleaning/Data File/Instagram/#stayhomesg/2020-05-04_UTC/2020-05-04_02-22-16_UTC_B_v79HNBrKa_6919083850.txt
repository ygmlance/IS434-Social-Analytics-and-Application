Had a fruitful zoom crochet-a-long with @hugayarn (2nd pic). We both wanted to use up some of our leftover stash and a phone pouch would be a quick make. We were focused and completed it in one session. Yeah!

This pattern is from a YouTube video by Adel Handmade. 
Yarn: Polyester
Hook: 3.5mm @cloverusa
