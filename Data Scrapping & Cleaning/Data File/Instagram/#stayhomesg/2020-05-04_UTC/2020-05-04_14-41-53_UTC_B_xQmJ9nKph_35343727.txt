It's my birthday! I guess i should feel special since not everyone gets to experience a cb #quarantinebirthday. Truly a unique once in a lifetime experience which I hope it does not happen again. I was all prepped for a zoom yoga session but stunned to see so many ppl. 
Greatly blessed and loved by everyone of them. Can cry ㅠㅠ so happy I still get cake during this period and not just any cake, but a super yummy basque burnt cheesecake!! What have I done to deserve such wonderful people in my life?! Maybe lots of great things in my past life. Lol. Can't wait to see all of u physically n give lots of hugs n kisses. X 
Also receive soso many deliveries today I would like to thank my doorbell for working so hard 🤣

Ps: why the singing not unsynchronized one?
