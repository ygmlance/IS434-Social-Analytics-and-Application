From #instasgSundayWindowView - we found this awesome shot by @ongwill. We love how the frame is split to 3 columns with landmark filling the side while the subject takes the middle one. Nice composition, and also the fact itâ€™s not over-edited as itâ€™s quite easy for Instagrammers to slide into the HDR mode to pump up the shadow. For us, we love whatâ€™s supposed to be silhouette stays as silhouette.

Thanks to everyone who has joined! Any guess what would be the next theme for this weekend? ðŸ˜¬
