Praying hard that things get better soon. We're doing great guys. But don't get impatient and complacent now ya. The virus isn't going away when CB ends. Not until a cure is found. So life CANNOT be the same as before. Be wise and be responsible. We need to not take this progress for granted. Let's be thankful but not forget to think before acting. Stay safe and sane people. We can do this!
