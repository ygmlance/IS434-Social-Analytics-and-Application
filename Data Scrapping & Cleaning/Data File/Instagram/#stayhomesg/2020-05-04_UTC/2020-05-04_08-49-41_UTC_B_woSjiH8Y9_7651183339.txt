Over the past few weeks, our volunteers have been delivering hawker meals to Factory Converted Dormitories (FCDs) as part of Project Wok the Talk.‚Å£
‚Å£
Project Wok the Talk is an initiative by the YMCA of Singapore to reach out and support both service providers and vulnerable groups during this season.‚Å£
‚Å£
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruption to vulnerable groups, as well as service providers including hawkers, taxi/private hire drivers and migrant workers.‚Å£
‚Å£
As part of Wok the Talk, we engage our hawker and taxi/private hire drivers to deliver care packages to vulnerable groups such as persons with special needs, seniors, migrant workers, and less-privileged youth who face difficulties affording or accessing food and necessities during this time.‚Å£
‚Å£
Wok the Talk with us by donating to the link in our bio! Your donation will provide meals and groceries to the vulnerable communities we serve üíô.
