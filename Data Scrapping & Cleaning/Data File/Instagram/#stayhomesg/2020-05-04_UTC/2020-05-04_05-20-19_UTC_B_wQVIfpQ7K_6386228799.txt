Another Buddha bowl for today. Yesterday I cooked some quinoa, black rice, made hummus, and roasted different types of vegetables. With those prepared veggies and grains, I can prepare easy meals for this week. Today I got roasted broccoli, green beans, red cabbage and marinated carrots with lettuce and quinoa. I made a simple dressing with sesame oil and yuzu sauce. It was delicious! Have you tried making your own Buddha bowl?
