#stayhomesg: One Pot Olive Vegetable Rice! 
Extremely busy today. Instead of Olive Vegetable Fried Rice, I just throw in Olive Vegetable into the rice cooker with washed rice grains. Adding a little colour, throw in carrot dice too. Sprinkle some Chinese celery bits and serve in cute tea cup. The night scene is beautiful outside my house, beautiful peaceful night.
