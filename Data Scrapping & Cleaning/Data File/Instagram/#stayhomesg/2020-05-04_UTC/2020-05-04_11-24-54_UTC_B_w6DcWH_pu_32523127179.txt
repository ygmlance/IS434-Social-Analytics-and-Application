😋Taste: 8/10. Decided to create rice bowls based on what we had in the fridge. We built our bowl around 1kg of pork ribs that we wanted to use up, and the giant green eye squid which we love (and spent a considerable amount of time scouring wet markets for). A playful experiment with different flavours and textures - definitely an “Angmoh cai peng” sort of meal
