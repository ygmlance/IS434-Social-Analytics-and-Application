🏋🏻‍♀️Home workout tip🏋🏻‍♀️
If you have limited equipment, tempo training should be your best friend. You can use bodyweight, bands, dumbbells or whatever weight you have access to. Chasing the pump is key to retaining muscle mass you’ve worked hard to build.💪🏻

If you aren’t using tempo in your own routine, then there is a huge piece missing if you want to get maximum results. This applies to strength, muscle building, fat loss, sports performance etc.

So what exactly is tempo? Tempo refers to the speed of one rep of an exercise.
