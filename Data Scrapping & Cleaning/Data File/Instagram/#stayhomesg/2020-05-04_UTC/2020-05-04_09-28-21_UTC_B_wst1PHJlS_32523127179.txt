Basic Sourdough 🍞
.
🍴Overall ease: 5/10
.
🛒Ingredients: starter, flour, water, salt
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: changed our starter (“Mr Q”) to a full white starter (“Mr W”), which meant that we worked with a new and weak starter. The process was as per usual, although we added water into the DO during baking, to allow for more blistering.
.
😋Taste: 6/10. Tried to return to basics to test new recipes. Evidently a weak starter given the uneven hole sizes within the crumb. It also did not have as much oven spring as we hoped for. Nonetheless, the taste and texture were still great!
