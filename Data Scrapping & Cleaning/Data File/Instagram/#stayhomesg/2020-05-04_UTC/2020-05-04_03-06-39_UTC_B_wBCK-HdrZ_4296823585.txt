From crisp, golden crepes to fluffy American-style pancakes, we have something here for everyone 🥞⁠

When you are on a fat-loss diet or trying to stick to a healthier food plan, most traditional pancakes won't be for you. ⁠
.⁠
.⁠
Often high in sugar and refined carbohydrates, pancakes aren't your friend when it comes to staying on track.⁠
.⁠
.⁠
So, we've compiled four delicious pancake recipes for you to try, which are higher in protein and with healthier toppings. ⁠

We've included whey protein in some of the recipes, and paired our favourite flavours with various toppings – but feel free to mix and match with your own preference in flavour.⁠
