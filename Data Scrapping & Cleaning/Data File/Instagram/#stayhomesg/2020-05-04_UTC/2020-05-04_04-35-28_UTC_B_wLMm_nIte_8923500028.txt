It's day TWENTY-EIGHT of the #CircuitBreaker and I'm craving for Laksa and Lor Mee. But with the news about domestic waste going up by 40% over the past 2 months, I couldn't justify buying takeaway with disposables! So what did I do?? I checked the list of vendors on the @barepack.co app and found out that @kopifellas was on it! I then proceded to get (not one) but BOTH of them for myself and my brother! â €
â €
They delivered it to my doorstep piping hot and the contactless QR scanning to check out my barePack containers were done in no more than 3 seconds. â €
â €
I was so happy with this treat I nearly forgot we were going through a pandemic. ðŸ¤£â €
â €
What are your favourite local delicacy eateries that you'd like to see on the @barepack.co app soon?? Tag them in the comments! â €
