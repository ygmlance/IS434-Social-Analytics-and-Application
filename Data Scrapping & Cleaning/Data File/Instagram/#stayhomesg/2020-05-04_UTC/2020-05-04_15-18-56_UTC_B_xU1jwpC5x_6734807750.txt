Painting our emotions. Inspired by @tinkertots.my and some of Hugoâ€™s favourite books which he has read so many times in the past year. First we read the books together and then I asked him what colors does he feel with you each emotion (eg happy, sadness, anger, love) and he picked a colour and we painted next to the corresponding emotions. Then he painted the various emotions on a blank card. This can be a great introduction to understanding his own emotions and later on using art as an outlet to express them too! #followingjoy #followthechild #reggioinspired #paintingwithtoddlers #expressiveart #paintyouremotion #toddlerart thecolormonster #todayiam #whatsyourfavouritecolour #thecolourbook #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited
