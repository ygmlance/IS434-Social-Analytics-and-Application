Carnival game: Toss the ring

Homemade verion to keep the girls busy. They were well engaged from point of making to the challenge on who has the most ring hook.

Throwing the ring game is simple to make and is a great way for children to have fun and expend their creativity while developing the important gross motor skills and balancing.
