This entire week, we’re taking the time to celebrate the people who gave us life, and teach us how to live—in the lead up to Mother’s Day, we’ll be sharing the stories of three special women, who have documented their stories through a series of snapshots.  In today’s feature, meet Grace: a mother of two, a creative through and through, and an optimist who knows the importance of looking on the sunny side of things, despite the dark clouds.  Read the full feature on #shentonista at the link in our profile.
