Savoury Tarts ☁️KID-FRIENDLY☁️ || What did Hope have for dinner? No one asked. But I’m telling you 😂 : Creamy Salmon Tarts!

Anyway, I made a yummy, creamy Béchamel sauce for Hope’s pasta lunch (yummy to the adults anyway) and I had the hardest time watching her eat. For a child who usually gobbles up her food, she was so distracted and refused to eat halfway. Spent an hour with her and I  lost my patience - moms you feel me?

I didn’t want to waste a perfectly good sauce and was adamant to make something with the same Béchamel. So Creamy Salmon Tarts it is!

I learned this cheat recipe for a quick dinner for mums who don’t have the time. (So must share! Think it was from me binge-watching @foodnetworkasia ) I used puff pastry and even baked this in the toaster this time. Total win!

Came out yums and she loved it! I had substituted salmon with chicken before, done a medley of vegetables, substituted white sauce with a tomato-based sauce - so go wild! (Hence the video only centre around working with the puff pastry / assembling) Enjoy!
