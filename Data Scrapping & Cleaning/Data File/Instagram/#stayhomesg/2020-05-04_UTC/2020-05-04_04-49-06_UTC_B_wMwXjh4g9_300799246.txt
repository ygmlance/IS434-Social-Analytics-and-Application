Who says doing delivery is easy?

We have to look for parking (without being fined coz theres goes the earnings for that day)

When parking is closed, we have to parked to the building opposite road...
Push the trolley with the packages to the designated location (handling with care so that the package will not be damaged, esp when it's raining)

When finally reached, we have to keep calling security post to release the door...
Look how tired & long we waited, till the Abg singpost cekak pinggang üòÇ

Sesungguhnye kami berpuasa...Ya Allah, kami mohon agar dipermudahkan segala urusan kami kerana kami keluar utk mencari rezeki yg Halal...aammiinn ya rabbal alamin... Like Jamal always say, Hustle Demi Hasil ‚ù§
