Postpartum Day 25!

Wrapping back my waist and aiming to lose those tummy flabs! @envyhersingapore Tummy Lift Recovery Binder defo did a wonderful job in bringing me back my confidence. & also wearing their new collection Shona Seamless Wire-less T-shirt Nuring Bralette, which is really comfortable and lightweight! Making it so much breathable for me in the recent SG weather ðŸ¥µ! Anyway canâ€™t wait to get my hands on fast food and ice cream after this confinement. So tempted right now!
