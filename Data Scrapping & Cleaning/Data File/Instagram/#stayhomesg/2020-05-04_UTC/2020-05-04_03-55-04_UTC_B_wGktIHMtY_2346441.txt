Day 28 of #circuitbreaker: Weekday breakfast in bed can only happen during this stay home period 😆 I am always on a look out for healthier breakfast choice :) Tried Kellogg’s New Mueslix Raisin & Almond Crunch yesterday and am hooked on eating it daily now. It just feels so healthy will all that grains & nuts inside. Super fuss free, just pour & serve & there u have your goodness inside a bowl 😛 ⁣
