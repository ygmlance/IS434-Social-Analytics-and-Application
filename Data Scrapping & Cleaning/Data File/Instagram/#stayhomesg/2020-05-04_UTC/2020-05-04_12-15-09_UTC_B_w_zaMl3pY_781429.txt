Made kaya the other day with 3 simple ingredients- eggs, gula melaka and fresh coconut milk. If there is one thing that I have learnt during the whole Circuit Breaker, that is appreciation. Appreciating the effort put in to every dish that is served on the table as well as every single thing in life that I used to take for granted of.
