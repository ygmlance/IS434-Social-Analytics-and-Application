Stir fry 🥗 with teriyaki 🐤 tsukune (Japanese meat ball) that I’ve bought near office warehouse and pan fried salmon drizzled in garlic butter sauce.  Simple home cooked dinner for circuit breaker day x (I’ve lost count of how many days had past 😅) #circuitbreaker #food #asian #homecooking #stayhomesg #garlicbuttersalmon #spinach #tsukune #jigglyjiggscook #foodblogger
