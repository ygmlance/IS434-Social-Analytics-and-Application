Around the world, we are adjusting to a new reality in every part of our lives as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We extend our sympathy to all who are impacted. We also offer our gratitude to those workers and organisations that are on the front lines battling this unprecedented event.
Savills wishes you, your loved ones and fellow colleagues a safe passage through this difficult period.
Please take care, stay positive and find some time for having fun and smiling.
