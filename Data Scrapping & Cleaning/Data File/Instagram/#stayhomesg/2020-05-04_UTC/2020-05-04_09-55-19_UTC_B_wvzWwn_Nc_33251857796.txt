We have made it to the 1st work from home day in May! Pour yourself a cuppa & give yourself a pat on the back for staying strong & keeping your family safe. Big kudos to parents who juggled between babysitters & corporate workers, teachers who kept students engaged & all essential workers who kept the whole country going 💪🏻💪🏻 Take this midway milestone to give thanks, reflect & START what you have been putting off despite the time at home. Whether its getting down to consolidating your finances in the current climate, getting that home fitness regime going or that dreaded spring clean that never happened, START NOW! 🤺

May the Fourth be with us!
