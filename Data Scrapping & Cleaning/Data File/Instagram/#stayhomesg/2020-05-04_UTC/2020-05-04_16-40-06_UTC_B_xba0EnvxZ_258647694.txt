Circuit Breaker Hack - Clean up, clean up, spending the last 2 days to clean up the house. Mummy and little Carrick have a challenge! Who’s better in this?

Alright, back to topic. We all need a clean and healthy environment especially this period when we are all cooped up at home.

Effective in fighting viruses and bacteria, the Nursery and Toy Disinfectant Spray from @sgswipe is highly recommended cos one of the active ingredients in the product is NEA and HSA approved. It’s non-toxic so definitely safe for children in the house.

Check out their wide range of household cleaning and baby products in their website.
