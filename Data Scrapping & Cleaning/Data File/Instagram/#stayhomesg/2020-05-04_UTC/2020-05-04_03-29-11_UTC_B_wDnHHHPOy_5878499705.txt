You know what's better than watches? Watches with cats on them. The Olivia Burton Illustrated Animals had exactly that without the design being too cartoonish & it immediately called out to me! 
Having the watch art look like Catalina is definitely a bonus. ðŸ˜»

Huge thanks to @cocomicom for this lovely watch! ðŸ’• They have loads of other designs & watch brands [Olivia Burton, Paul Hewitt, Bering, etc.] up on their website so do check them out to see what they have to offer!

Oh & I totally know it's Moody Monday, i-it's not like I forgot what day it is because of CB. I-I totally know it's M-Monday. Y-yeh. -sweats nervously-

Please tell me I'm not the only one who's losing track of what day it is. ðŸ™ƒ
