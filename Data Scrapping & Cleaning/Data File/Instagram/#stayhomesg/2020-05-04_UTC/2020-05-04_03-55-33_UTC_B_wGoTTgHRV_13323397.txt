I am adding the @hausbrew.sg Yuzu Jasmine tea to my fav drink list! The weather has been crazy of late and this flavour together with Haus Brew’s other 10 flavours are gonna be my must drink during the hot afternoons.
.

I have jazzed up my glass with some blue pea ice cubes and lemon juice. Sure brightens and refreshes any hot tropical day! It’s good that fruity teas are not overly sweet! It also comes with the HPB healthier choice logo👍🏻
