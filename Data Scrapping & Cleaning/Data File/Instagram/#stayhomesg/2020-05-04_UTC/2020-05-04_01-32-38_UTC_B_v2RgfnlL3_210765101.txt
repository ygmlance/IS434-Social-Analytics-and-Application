today marks end of the one month circuit breaker but, also the start of extended month .

honestly, i did not do much this one month . and through this circuit breaker, am somehow grateful that i got to;
spend all the time i have with my annoyin husband,
have all the rest i needed,
eat my husband's cookin more than usual,
heal the mental damage from previous reportin head,
--- which all these i dont get to when i was in my previous job

so, extended month, new daily outline 💪🏿
lets all continue to stay safe 🌈

p.s : i do miss cancellin plans though 😛
