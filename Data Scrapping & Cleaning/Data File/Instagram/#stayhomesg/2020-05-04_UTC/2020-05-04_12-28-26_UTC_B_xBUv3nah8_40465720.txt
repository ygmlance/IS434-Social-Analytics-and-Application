My usual morning starts off with a 30 min workout 🧘🏻‍♀️ from YouTube channels and followed by lots of water...Before my day starts to get crazy with the kids😵.
.
I’ve been adding a capful of probiotics beverage from 
@Legenze_Asia to my water. This is day 7 of having the beverage 👍🏻 and I am starting to enjoy the taste, it taste a little  like adding lemons 🍋 to water. .
So what’s actually in it? Here are the ingredients:
Soy Protein, Soy Peptide, Green Tea, Lemon, Oat Bran, Ganoderma, Ginger, Brown Rice, Black Rice, Sesame, Lactobacillus Casei, and Yeast. .
Good stuff! Hit them up if you want to find out more. .
