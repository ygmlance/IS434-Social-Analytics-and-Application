#blogged: @8crabs fresh feast!
Good Morning! During this #circuitbreaker #stayhome period if you're craving some restaurant standard seafood crabs, here's a fresh feast for you to consider! Also, this is a first that my hubs did a review on my behalf while i took photos. Love that he can now do the foodie review! This blog is truly a family's effort.😍 Thank you 8crabs for the fresh feast!
Have great week ahead!
