End of the day we do everything to AVOID or ACHIEVE a feeling. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
It’s important to manage your emotions because it’s one of the key to success. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
If you’re not able to manage your emotions, you will eventually stop whatever you’re doing. You will not make calls, meet prospect etc. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
If your world is smaller everything becomes bigger. You get upset about everything more easily. ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
You can create a bigger world by finding mentors, reading books. When your world is bigger, things start to seem smaller and you will manage your emotions better. ⠀⠀
