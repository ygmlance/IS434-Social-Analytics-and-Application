2015, the year I decided to be an Insurance Agent.
•
A shot taken by the fiancee of me mugging the books in my old messy room back then.
•
It's the year where I just ORD and decisions had to be made, it's the year where i roughly vaguely knew what I deep down wanted in life but nothing was concrete, and it's also the year where I still had my jawline.
•
Took that step at 2015, and baby steps till 5 years later today, I look back to see how far I've come, yet I still continue to look forward to everyday towards the future as theres so much more to grow and potential to unveil!
•
2020, the year where YOU decided to be an Insurance Agent. My Team's expanding.
•
May this year be a year of growth and change for you my friends.
