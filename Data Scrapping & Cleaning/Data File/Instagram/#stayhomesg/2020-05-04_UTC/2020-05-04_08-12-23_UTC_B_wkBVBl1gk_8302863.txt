Gabriel is not a big fan of vegetables. So we always try to find ways to sneak in some greens 🥬 in his food.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Over the weekend he wanted to try making this mini pizzas 🍕Though my patience in baking bread normally is pretty low (proof, shape, rest, proof again, etc)😅, I gave it a go, as I could sneak in vegetables for the toppings 🥬🍅😀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This recipe will produce soft, bread-like pizza bases, hence you can use this recipe to make other bread like sausage bread, chocolate bread, cheese bread, etc😋

1. Mix A. Add B a little bit at a time and knead until dough smooth.

3. Cover and let rise until doubled for about 30mins.
4. Punch dough to release gas. Weigh dough 30gr each and shape into small balls. Put on a tray that has been lined with baking paper.
