Today we are gonna introduce the "Down" exercise. It's one of the more difficult ones as it involves getting the dog onto the ground, which sometimes is a submissive behaviour they don't like. And also for bigger dogs! But if Zelda can do it, so can any dog!
Feel free to PM if you need further advise. Stay home, stay safe!
