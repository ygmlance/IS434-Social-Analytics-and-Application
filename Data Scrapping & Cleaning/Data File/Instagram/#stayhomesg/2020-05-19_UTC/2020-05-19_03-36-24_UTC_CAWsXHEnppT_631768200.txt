Day 43 of Circuit breaker.
I decided to have a different breakfast experience.
I have been eating bread mostly.ðŸ˜Š
This Meiji Plain crackers was bought on the eve of Circuit breaker 6-4-20. It was intended for tea time snacks just incase i am hungry. However i am very blessed with other snacks.
Since Circuit breaker is coming to an end. I better clear it.
Ths is my first time making a Cheese omelette.
The Ingredients are luncheon meat, tomatoes,  carrots. And of course cheese & eggs.
Chopped up the first 3 ingredients and stirred fried them, add the egg & finally the cheese. 
Fold the cook omelette, sprinkled with dried Parsley and garnish with lettuces. I like it spicy with Hay Bee Hiam chilli too.
Trust me these Meiji crackers really goes well with this cheese omelette & chilli.
Very Yummy!
