What is dry-aging? It’s actually a simple scientific process where the meat is left to mature in a climate-controlled space, long enough for the natural enzymes to work their magic into the meat.⁣
⁣
At Ginett, our dry-aged beef is done in-house – aged to a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks in order to give the steak not just a more developed, umami beefy flavor, but also making the texture more tender at the same time.⁣
