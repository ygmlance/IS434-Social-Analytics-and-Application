Let’s cool down ❄️❄️☃️
.
They filled up balloons with water and kept them in freezer last evening 🎈💧
.
Today they took them out and wanted to carve some artistic piece of art with a butter knife, which was not happening 😅
.
Then they decided to paint the ice 🎨👩🏻‍🎨👨🏻‍🎨Resulted in messy pools of water all over the table 💦 The messier the merrier I guess 😅
.
Though none of their plans with the ice blocks worked as they wanted to, they were still so happy and had a lot of fun 😀
.
I kept the ice back into the freezer when they had to go back to their school work, so they could play with it again later.
.
Time is tough. Glad that they still can find joy in the little things 💕
