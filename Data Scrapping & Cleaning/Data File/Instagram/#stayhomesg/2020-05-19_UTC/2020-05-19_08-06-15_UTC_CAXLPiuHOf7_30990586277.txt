Made from the leaves of the Yerba mate (ilex Paraguariensis) plant, the consumption of this tea is an age-old tradition, enjoyed by generations across South America and the world. Weâ€™ve since developed our vision of the modern mate: a crisp, sparkling tea for your enjoyment, whether itâ€™s day or night.â €
