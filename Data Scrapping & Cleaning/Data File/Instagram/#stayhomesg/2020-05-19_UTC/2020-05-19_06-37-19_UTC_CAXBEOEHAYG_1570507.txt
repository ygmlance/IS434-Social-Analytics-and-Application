My wife is a Great Cook. Her taste bud is incredibly sharp  and she likes to challenge herself duplicating dishes she fancy or I like.
So during this period, she had slightly more time and she came up with a few to show off a bit!😁😁
Dalgana coffee
Tiramisu 
Chocolate Eclair
Bacon & Egg Quiche
Creamy "better than KFC style" mashed potato without sauce!
(I claimed it..🤭🤭)
Mango yogurt popsicle 
Cream cheese almond biscuit
Honestly, they taste really good and I particularly like the Quiche and mashed potato!😁
