Any Aaron Kwok fans here?! ❤️ His online live concert two weeks back was so good, and he is still looking soooo good at 54 years old. Omg I just cannot... ❤️ Para Para dance was all the rage in the early 2000s, and here’s my take (with my lookalike girl squad) on Aaron Kwok’s Para Para Sakura! Don’t laugh ah! I actually went to learn the whole dance but TikTok (add me @xinyicyndisoh) doesn’t have the full length of the music. So here’s the chorus! I shall try recording the full dance next time 😂.
