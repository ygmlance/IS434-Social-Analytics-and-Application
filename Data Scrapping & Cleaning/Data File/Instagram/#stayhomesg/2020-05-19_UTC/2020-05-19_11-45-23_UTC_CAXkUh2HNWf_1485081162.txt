Ginkgo Barley with Beancurd

Dessert bar is common in wedding party because dessert are sweet and we hope to be blessed with lifetime of sweetness in our marriage. However in reality, life will never sweet all the time especially now with Covid-19 spreading fiercely around the whole world which affected lots of families financially. I hope we can walk through this difficult times and bring back all the sweet time again.

Today we represent Ginkgo Barley with beancurd dessert or Chinese called “白果腐竹糖水” This dessert is very easy to make, very popular in Chinese home cooking. The cooking time of the dried beancurd depends on how you like it. Some people like it cooked until completely dissolved, that looks like soy milk, others like them reserving some bits and pieces. This dessert can be served hot or cold, suitable for all seasons.
