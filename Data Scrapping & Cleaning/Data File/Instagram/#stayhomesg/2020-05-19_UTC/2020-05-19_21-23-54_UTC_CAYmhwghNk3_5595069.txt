Spending the whole morning making soya milk todayðŸ¥›
It was quite an experience I have to say ðŸ˜…
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
It was definitely nicer (in our opinion) and cheaper then store bought.
However I also find it quite tedious to make.
Removing the skins from the beans probably the most tedious part ðŸ˜³
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Nevertheless, everyone is happy with the outcomeðŸ˜€
Well, I told them, nice not nice, have to drinkðŸ¤­ðŸ¤£
