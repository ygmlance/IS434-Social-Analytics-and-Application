【 Day 7 - 💃Mingle Tangle🕺 】

This symbol of the eye has different meanings  in different cultures like the Eye of Providence, the Eye of Horus, Eye of Fatima, the Evil Eye, and etc. Interestingly, I realised that the eye symbol seemed to appear quite frequently in my tangling pieces recently. So what does it mean?

One can find many different answers in Google, however is that really the true meaning or accurate? Or is it something I should work on or to recognise? Or it could be the new insights found after attending this morning's SoulCollage® & Labyrinth Webinar?

Using the SoulCollage® process, I shall slowly explore with my own made SoulCollage® cards to answer the question and to discover the hidden treasure or message.
