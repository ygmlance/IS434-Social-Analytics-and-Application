If you’ve ever been to the Gandhi museum in Delhi🇮🇳 , you’ll know that this line is above the door, and it was actually a response by Gandhi to a question from a journalist. So Gandhi was getting on a train and the journalist called after him, “Gandhi, Gandhi, what’s your message to the world?” ⁠
⁠
And Gandhi turned around and said, “My life. My life is my message.”⁠
⁠
And your life is your message too. All of us. It might not be as big a message as Gandhi’s — but your life has to be your message.⁠
⁠
For us at #TheSensesTherapy, our message is to use sound therapy and yoga 🧘‍♀️to enable individuals to nurture inner peace and tranquility🍃, and exercise greater awareness over emotions - so you can be - you, and we can be just - us. ⁠
⁠
If you are taking a break, we hope you can enjoy our new #soundhealing audio 🎧  too (link in the bio⬆️)⁠
⁠
Because we believe, with help and support, everyone can be just - themselves too🙌
