Ridiculous sense of achievement when my planning turns out well and I don't waste any food- because it's difficult to finish that bag of onions or chilies or herbs when there is only 2 of us. 
So I tried a savory cheese and onion beer batter bread which turned out pretty good (brown onion bits are yum), and it goes well with the guacamole which I made with remaining bits of garlic,cilantro, chili and lemon. Time for tea break ðŸ‘¸
