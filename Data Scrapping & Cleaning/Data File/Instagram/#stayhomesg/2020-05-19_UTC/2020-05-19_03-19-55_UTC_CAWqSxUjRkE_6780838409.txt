covid-19 reflections.

so i signed up for a voluntary position and went for a swab training recently. some friends are concerned about my safety: 'why do you sign up voluntarily to expose yourself to the virus?!' close friends and ex-classmates weren't surprised at the decision I made. maybe i miss the healthcare sector, maybe i FOMO i never got to work in one. but i think what eventually drew me to sign up was (once again) seeing a need, identifying myself as a potential candidate to play a part to plug the gap, and just being able to do it.

being healthcare-trained helps a lot; everything isn't as scary when one understands how things work.all kinds of people came for training - younger than me, older than me, healthcare students, teacher-looking adults, and others which i can't tell where they are from. it's heartening to know that we are finally coming together as a nation. the dentists who conducted the training, the sups who are probably from hospitals, more volunteers helping to get registration in order, and the uncles & aunties who sit at the entrances making sure we enter safely.

i haven't been able to do much this circuit breaker period, except to actively stay at home. so i sing a song and express my gratitude to everyone out there lor. i sing better than i draw so...deployment, please come soon. 新加坡，一起加油！
