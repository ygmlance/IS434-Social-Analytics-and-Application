I was experimenting with making Brownies that were dense, fudgey, and ultra-smooth.

This was mostly French butter, organic non-alkanized cocoa, chocolate, eggs, and just a wee bit of flour.

But I managed to achieve the consistency and flavour I was aiming for - hurray!

Best of all, all made in just one pot over the stove, then baked gently 🙌🏻
