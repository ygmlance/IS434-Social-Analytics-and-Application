1. Marinate the chicken wings with soya sauce, sesame oil, honey and pepper. 
2. Depending on how many chicken wings you want to cook, make sure you put more honey than soya sauce. 
3. Once marinated, wait for 10 mins before frying them. Alternatively, you can choose to leave the marinated chicken wings in the fridge overnight to add a stronger flavour to it. 
4. Oil the pan, start frying them until they look crispy brown. Turn each chicken wing to make sure both sides are thoroughly cooked through. 
5. Add the leek and mix it around with the chicken wings. Make sure it looks sticky with the honey covered. 
6. Ready to eat!🔥Goes really well with rice!! 🍚💯
