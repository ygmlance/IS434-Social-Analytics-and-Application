@saveursg has recently launched new online food delivery store – shop.saveur.sg offering affordable French fare, favorite tapas delight, steak indulgence and artisanal ice cream at the comfort of your home.
.
The one stop store includes four concepts namely Saveur, MediumRare, FrapasBar and Bread & Butterfly. Lunch came nicely packed and warm. We enjoyed both the prawn aglio and mushroom linguine, flavorful and springy noodles. The ribeye with roasted potatoes and broccoli was a perfect medium 👌🏻
