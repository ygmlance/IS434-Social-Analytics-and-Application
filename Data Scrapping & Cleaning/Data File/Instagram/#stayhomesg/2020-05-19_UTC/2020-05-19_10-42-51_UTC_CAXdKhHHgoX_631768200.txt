Day 43 circuit breaker dinner.
Nothing special here.
Just my usual organic barley and brown rice porridge with sweet potatoes. All three colours,  yellow,  orange and purple.
I think I shouldn't add the yellow & orange colour as  i didn't get a nice purple colour porridge.😁
Add in broccoli stems & tomatoes. Cooked together including the hard boiled egg.
Make a different Hay bee hiam egg today.
Add sesame dressing and furikake too.
The last pic was 5th may with another brand of HBH.
I should have started eating this way on the day 1 of Circuit breaker.
It s a very good meal for sweat it out.
Good detox. Clean my pores. 😁
