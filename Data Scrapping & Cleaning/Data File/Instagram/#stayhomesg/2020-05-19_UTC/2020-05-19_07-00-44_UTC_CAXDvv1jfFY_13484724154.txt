Today I used my Micron pink pen instead of the usual black to draw as I saw from @crayola_singapore that Pink is the colour of the month!

This is a colour I seldom use and I thought it was a refreshing experience. Maybe I could explore more with my Pink Pen with more drawings. Who knows, some hidden treasure could be discovered.
