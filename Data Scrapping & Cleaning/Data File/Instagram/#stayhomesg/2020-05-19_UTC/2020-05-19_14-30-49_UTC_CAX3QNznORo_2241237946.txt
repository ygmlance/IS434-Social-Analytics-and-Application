The reason why theres no flour is cos there are #ccb #bakers who are bored at home. Actually I’m not bored at home  cos I still have to go to work but after looking at everyone’s bread I am #fomo - Ing too. I managed to get my hands on $8 Japanese bread flour just cos it’s so exorbitant that no one else bought it besides me 🤦🏻‍♀️ #sgfood #cb #circuitbreaker #sghome #stayhomesg #stayhomesgchallenge #sgunited
