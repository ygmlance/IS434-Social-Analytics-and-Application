These days, my prayers have changed from," Dear Lord, help sonny to focus on his studies for PSLE, to God, grant him wisdom and direction in His life in you." Today, after a lecture on an issue, the Holy Spirit enlightened us on how focusing is not the issue. PSLE is neither the goal. This boy has been obedient and responsible is many aspects of his life. And I am proud of him. It's just this motivation aspect in studies that has yet to emerge.
Does he have a thirst for learning or desire to grow?
If it is not there, all the nagging and pushing can only go so far.. I shared with him how that was the case for me in my O levels. I had no desire to learn my academics until I decided to seek God for that desire. After school daily I'd kneel and ask God to give me that desire to be hardworking and for help in my studies. God heard that prayer and I was transformed since then. Desiring to learn and please God became stronger as the years went by.
This time, I asked my son to seek God. To ask Jesus daily for a desire to learn and a teachable heart to listen to God. This will be our prayers from henceforth. Also wrote a card to encourage him.
This #circuitbreaker #stayhomesg period has been a good time of deeper reflections and plowing of the ground. As we learn how to dwell in the secret place of the Most High, and slowly grow to abide under the shadow of the Almighty, our joy will be complete. (Ps91:1) Slowly, PSLE has lesser hold on me. Slowly, Jesus is redeeming my heart back to Him alone.
'But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.'
Matthew 6:33 NKJV
Dear friends, how about your heart?
