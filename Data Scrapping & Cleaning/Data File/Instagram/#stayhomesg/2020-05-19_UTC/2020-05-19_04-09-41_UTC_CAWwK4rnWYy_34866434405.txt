♡ HIMALAYAN BATH SALT ♡
4 things that I mainly focused on when I came up with this great product, MOISTURIZING, SOFTENING, BRIGHTENING AND REJUVENATING. All in a pretty little bathroom safe jar.

Omg! I can't tell you how excited I am about this new product. Its all natural and smells delicious!! Also non toxic, cruelty free and plant based. So you know it's safe and definitely gonna feel the results. This is a body bath salt that can be used from neck to toe. It's just the body therapy and pampering we all need now.
