[16.05.20] Day 40 of #circuitbreaker:

The cub has become 醒目 seng-mook! Whenever he doesn’t know what to order for dinner, he’ll just suggest curry fish head! I think we have that once every week since the circuit breaker started, iirc. Not only does he enjoy the curry, he has started to appreciate the fish eye a lot more than his sister now.
