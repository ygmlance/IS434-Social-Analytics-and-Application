#ThrowBack post. Thankful for the opportunity to work with School of Science & Technology (SST) in a rebranding project for the school's annual Open House event. We've dedicated a lot of our time in making sure that the marketing collaterals created were reflective of the school's values.⁠ We can't wait to share more of these with you!⁠
⁠
P.S. For those who haven't heard of SST, it is a school that allows students to tinker, explore and develop an entrepreneurial mind! How cool is that? The secondary school actually offers specially curated programmes designed for students who are curious and passionate about changing the world around them through application of Science, Technology, Engineering, Aesthetics and Mathematics (STEAM).⁠
