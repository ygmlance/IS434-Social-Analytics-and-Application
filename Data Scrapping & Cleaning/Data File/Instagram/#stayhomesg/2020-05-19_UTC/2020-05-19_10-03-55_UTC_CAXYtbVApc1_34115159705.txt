Atlas Bar recently got their few minutes of fame in Episode 4 of Westworld Season 3. It’s one of Singapore’s most beautiful bar for a reason. Yes, it’s pretty sad that we can’t visit them now but you can still find their signature Atlas Martini and Negroni at their brand new online store!
.
These cocktails come in bottles, so you can enjoy a sip or two right in the comfort of your home.
