.
🍴Overall ease: 2/10
.
🛒Ingredients: 20% rye starter, 80% bread flour, lemon zest of 3 lemons, 3 springs of rosemary, 7g of sea salt
.
👩🏻‍🍳Process: Same as always, except this time we added lemon zest and rosemary during lamination (swipe right to see the process)
.
😋Taste: 8/10. We loveee this flavour combination, and the bread was pillowy, but technically speaking, the rise was not great, the crumb structure was not open enough, and the bread was slightly under-baked. We took our foot off the pedal for this round of bake, and it’s a reminder to not be complacent - sourdough needs a lot of TLC!
