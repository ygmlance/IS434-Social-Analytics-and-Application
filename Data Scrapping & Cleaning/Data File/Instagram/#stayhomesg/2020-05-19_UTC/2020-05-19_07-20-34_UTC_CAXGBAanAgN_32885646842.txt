Tah-daaaaah!(from my favourite to the least lol)  Well the colours did run ALOT even though I left it over night but I missed a tip which is to sun dry it before releasing the rubber bands. I love the crumpled effect more than the other, and it is much easier. The heart was a fail! But I'm gonna cut parts of it and turn it into mask! Why not right. Since everyone need to mask up because of #covid19 . ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ #staythefuckhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #tiedyeshirt #tiedyenewbie #artsandcrafts #craftsofinstagram #reducereuserecycle (I used my dad's old white tees to turn it into smth new!)
