Luncheon meat or 午餐肉.
I used up my last serving of Luncheon meat for my cheese omelette this morning.
A total of six meals or six servings for this canned of 200gm size.
Per serving size is 56 - 60gm as i googled for the right portion size.
For 6 serving is around 33.3gm.
Is not that I am stingy that  have to divide into 6 portions. I just wanted to settle my craving in a less sinful way.😊
6 meals - 5 breakkie & 1 dinner.
If i will to include the Spam Lite & Spam single slice that will be 12 meals.
Alright ! Enough is enough. No more buying of luncheon meat for this Circuit breaker or even after Circuit breaker.
I guess is till next year if i want to settle my craving again. By then the Spam Single will be back. I 😊

P/S -  For 6 serving I had  never served it as lunch or 午餐。😊你可是我的六餐肉! 😁
