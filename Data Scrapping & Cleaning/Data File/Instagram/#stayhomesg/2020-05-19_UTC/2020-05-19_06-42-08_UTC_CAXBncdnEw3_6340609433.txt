4 Treasure Rice Set, $7.50 from 𝐓𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐯𝐞 𝐑𝐨𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 ⠀
⠀
Chef recommendation! This set is perfect for 2 to share and you can choose any 4 from 5 meats, Duck, Chicken, Char Siew, Pork Ribs and Sausage. ⠀
⠀
The set comes with 4 meat of your choice, white/chicken rice, 1 sunshine egg, vegetables and a bowl of white carrot soup which goes so well with the rice! The portion is very generous therefore is good for 2 pax sharing. Love their roasted meats as they are so deliciously roasted and you can ask them to remove the bones if you prefer. We opt for their chicken rice as it’s very fragrant and not too oily, for chilli lovers you would enjoy together with their chilli sauce, it’s so comforting and satisfying! ⠀
