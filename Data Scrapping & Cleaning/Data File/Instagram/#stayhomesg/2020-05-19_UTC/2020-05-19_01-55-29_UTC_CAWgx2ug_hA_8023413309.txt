Last week, a girlfriend surprised me with tubs of ice-cream 😋. My brother's boss sent dinner to us on Sunday night to congratulate his performance. These touches inspire me to pass on love to my friends and others in need @giving.sg ⁠

I wanted to send a surprise dinner to my friend, whom I haven't catch up with in a long time. In order to get the address, I had to lie that it was for my wedding invite... he thought I was pregnant because of the sudden news 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♀️ ⁠
⁠.⁠
Your ACTS of kindness, a smile, a dessert, has the potential to pass on thousands more love ❤️⁠
