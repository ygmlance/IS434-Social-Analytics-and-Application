We are from the Youth Group of Singapore Chin Kang Huay Kuan, a 102 years old Chinese Clan Association of Singaporean with ancestry from Chin Kang in Southern Fujian.  We have recently composed a Hokkien song to encourage people affected by Covid-19 to help each other and move forward without fear.  We have translated the Chorus into English.  Let’s move on as one People.  We are IN THIS TOGETHER.
