Doughnut worry, be happy!🍩😃
.
This doughnut took 6hours to proof ⏰
I prepared the dough past midnight, so it would be ready for breakfast the next day 🌤
.
I didn’t have to knead. I just slept through the 6hours, while the gluten did what it had to do. So im good 😴👍
.
Came morning, another 30mins of proofing, before finally frying them! 🍳👩🏻‍🍳
.
They were not perfect, but they were tasty!😋 The doughnuts were gone in less than half an hour 🤪 Im happy 😄
.
Should have made more, so I could share them with you 😘🍩
