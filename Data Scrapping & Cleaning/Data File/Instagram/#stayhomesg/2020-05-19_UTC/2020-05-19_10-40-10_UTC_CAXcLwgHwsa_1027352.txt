When you find yourself the blessed recipient of Double-Aged Kaluga Hybrid Caviar from @caviarcolony, and @sulyntan’s fluffiest and oh-so-fragrant-you-need-to-bury-your-nose-in-it #milkbuns, inspiration inevitably strikes. A google moment later, #eggs were scrambled almost to the letter of @gordongram’s famous recipe (I was short of creme fraiche, unfortunately). They could have been a touch runnier but I was happy enough. After ripping the milk bun almost all the way in half (leaving the top and bottom hanging together by sheer optimism), I shoveled on as much of the scramble as the Law of Falling Objects allowed. Repeated that with the caviar and was chuffed to see the hot, soft eggs hold every glistening roe in place.
As I suspected, because of its intense umaminess and salty taste, the Double-Aged Kaluga Hybrid Caviar’s performed the best when paired with food. Well, that turned out to the objective of its creation. As the company’s founder, Benjamin (@the_caviar_king) shared with me, he hopes this new ingredient will be an inspiration to Chefs everywhere. His initial 2-kilogram batch took an additional three months to produce but the extended period meant the stage belonged to the 醒味 (“wine flavour”) that arose from the caviar. The typical characteristics of nutty creaminess and saltiness had to take a backseat in this instance.
Do tap on the link in @caviarcolony’s bio if you fancy spoiling yourself silly. A little goes a long way, so be inspired and enjoy it with whatever you can think of. The sky’s the limit!
