Do you recognise this? It is a top, known as koma in Japan, and usually made of wood with a cord to spin it.⁣
⁣
To spin a “Koma”, you would need to first hoop the loop around the top, then wind the string tightly around the bottom part. Then, throw the “Koma” away from you, horizontally to the ground, and instantly pull the string towards you. The spinning force generated by the unwinding motion of the string will set the “Koma” to spin when it touches the ground. It takes a bit of practice, so don’t give up if you can’t get it the first time!⁣

You can find the illustrations with steps on how to wind your koma in this post, so please refer to them.⁣
