One of the dishes for Dinner last night. 
Attempting to make king oyster mushrooms to look like abalone. Hahaha~ 
Braised the mushrooms in oyster sauce, half teaspoon of dark soy sauce, garlic, half teaspoon of sugar and some chinese rice wine for around 10 mins. Set aside and blanched the spinach next.
Add spinach into the braised mushrooms and let it simmer for 2 to 3 mins. 
Serve with rice. 
You can turn this into a vegan dish by replacing oyster sauce with vegetarian oyster sauce (made from mushrooms). #spinachandkingoystermushroom #vegetarian #mushrooms #sghomecooks #sghomecookedmeals #sgrecipes #stayhomesg #eatathomesg #sgcooks #sgmummys #sgmommies #sgmums #SgWorkingMums #SgFTWM #sgmummys #sgmommies #sgmummies
