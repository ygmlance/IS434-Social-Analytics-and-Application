2 more weeks to the end of COVID19 Circuit Breaker period , hopefully...
This stay-home period requires effort to stay positive and joyful but it brings us more family time and most importantly, it helps many of us to realize the simplicity of happiness. We cook, eat as a family, do some gardening, practise abacus, play the piano, had chess games and even found insects which flew into our home.üôÇ
These pictures will remind me, in time to come, how we got through this adversity together. ‚ù§Ô∏è #covid19circuitbreaker #sgunited #maskup #stayhomesg #staysafestayhome #homeactivities #bebetterthanyesterday #treasurethemoments #creatingmemories #clarelyx #joshualyz #jacoblyh #cherylhotraveldiary #sgmummy #motherof3 #familylifeambassador #mrssingaporeuniverse2014
