I don’t usually post TWO IGTV videos in a day! Neither did I plan to bake cookies today. Went to the supermarket and I was looking for Famous Amos Cookies, suddenly dawned upon me why buy packet ones when I can bake? *ahem albeit with my newly found skill 👩🏻‍🍳*⁣
⁣
Suddenly remembered @iammmreow shared this recipe on FB a few days ago! Re-sharing the recipe she shared! She also added I could use a tbsp of coffee liquid, which I did and it smelled so good. ⁣
⁣
Then my first batch came out flat. I thought it had to be my destiny with cookies🌚. As googled and research a little more as to how and why it came out unsuccessful, it suddenly dawned upon me that my flour was way too little. ⁣
⁣
Double checked and yep. I converted 2,5 cups of flour wrongly. 👏🏻 Oh Pearlyn, your horrid carelessness as usual. ⁣
⁣
Quickly added the correct amount of flour and tried again. ⁣
⁣
I think it’s as close to how I remembered Famous Amos at Cinleisure to be! The burnt taste from the base and that crunch! My favourite was Macademia chocolate chips. What was yours?⁣
⁣
P.s. I omitted 0,5 cups of corn flour (not on my ingredient list either) as I didn’t have it. ⁣
⁣
Copying @iammmreow cos the title is just perfect. Naming it Famous Almost Cookies 😂. ⁣
