My post on Cheese Puff Pastry, a #FrozenPrataHacks got featured by Ms Nilanjana, a journalist with Straits Times, along with another mummy @whatadeloves with her hack of using Frozen Prata to make You Tiao (I should try that). 😍

Ms Nilanjana DM me to ask for permission to use my photo/ post which I gladly agreed and she was very nice to send me the link to the article which is under the COVID-19 Special. 
You can read the article here:

(You can sign up a free SPH account to read the articles on COVID-19 Specials). I guess this is probably one of the highlights that I'm glad to have during this period. 🤭
