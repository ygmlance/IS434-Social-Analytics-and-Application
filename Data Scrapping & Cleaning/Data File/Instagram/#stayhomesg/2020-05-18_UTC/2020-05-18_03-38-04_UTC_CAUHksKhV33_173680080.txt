We tried the following dishes and they are worth recommending

Thai claypot prawn vermicelli only $20.00. Signature dish here and a must try, with 3 large prawn. The vermicelli absorbed all the goodness and very flavorful. Next is the Fried Pork Belly, From $8.00. Those who like crispy pork will like this. Thai basil pork, authentic Thai dish, only From $8.00. We also like the Chicken Stir fried with cashew nut, From $8.00. You can order pork or other meat to be in this dish, there are options you can configure. This Phad Thai (Thai fried kway teow) is my favourite, simple yet so delicious and very traditional too with all the chili powder and lime etc. only From $7.00. Donâ€™t forget the Pandan leaf chicken From $8.00 and the Fried prawn cake From $8.00. This prawn cake is still delicious when we heat up over air fryer the next morning for breakfast. Yum Yum.

Who can forget the Pineapple fried rice from $7.00, moist and full of thai flavor , not like those fake ones sold somewhere where it taste like ordinary fried rice. If you like spicy soup then the Tom Yum is a must try, only from $8. The Green Curry Chicken from $8.00 is also great with plain rice.

There are still many items we did not have the chance to try, go over to their online store to see for yourself and order directly. Free delivery for $30, that is a bargain
