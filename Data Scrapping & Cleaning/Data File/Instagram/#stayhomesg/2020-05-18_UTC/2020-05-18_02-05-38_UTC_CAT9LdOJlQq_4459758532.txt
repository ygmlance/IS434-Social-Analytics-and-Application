🍞 ☕

Monday morning - back to the classic peanut butter and jelly on toast, with a little twist. Added muesli cereal, pistachios and strawberries to balance out the sweetness slightly as I'm not really a big fan of sweet stuff. Side note I think I need to be more generous with spreading the jam😂 Regardless, peanut butter and jelly combo is still the best!😍
