We got jiggly japanese cheesecake today! We used the same recipe but got the desired height (ie much less dense) with one main difference - i didnt whip the egg whites (my only job the last time round)! Guess my utility in the kitchen shld really be confined to giving directions and recipe ideas lol ðŸ˜†
Happy that this cheesecake even got my grandma's stamp of approval!
