Braised pork jowl char siew with spinach, mushrooms and kway tiao for lunch.
.
This is really a premium cut meat with a hefty price tag ðŸ˜… Swipe left and watch how well marbled and fatty the pork jowl is.
.
Was afraid of ruining it but thankfully, by fluke, it turned out well.
.
I braised the pork overnight and then arranged the slices in a single layer to grill for the charred effect. I grilled for about 5mins to achieve char and crisp.
.
I have 5 more slabs of pork jowl, will be trying out other recipes and sharing it. ðŸ˜Š
.
Notes:
Braising liquid (not too thick as it is used to mix kway tiao too)
2tbsp oysters sauce
2 tbsp hua tiao wine
1 tsp 5 spice powder
2 tbsp dark soya sauce
4 tbsp gula melaka
1 clove of garlic
A dash of salt
Water to cover the contents in the thermal pot until at least 80% full for optimal heat retention.

(ðŸ˜‚ crazy kids screaming in the background while I was trying to video the sizzling sounds of the grilled meat. Idk how so many IG super mamas can cook, plate more complex dishes and still have the young ones in check)
