Konnichiwa!
Tonight I’m bringing you to Japan 🇯🇵 and will be serving a simple fare. 
Menu for tonight is Umaki and Shio grilled chicken wings. 
Umaki is kabayaki eel wrapped in omelette. This is another form of tamagoyaki. 
My hub n girl thumbed up for it and chowed down their bowl of rice quickly. 
A simple and hearty meal! 
Itadakimasu!
