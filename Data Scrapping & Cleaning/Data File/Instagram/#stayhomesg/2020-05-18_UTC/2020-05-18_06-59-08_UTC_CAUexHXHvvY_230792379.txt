“SUCCESS is not LINEAR”
.
I loved this quote shared by Adam during our interview! It hits the nail on the head. Many times, we worked our asses off but still.. we don’t seem to get the results we want and give up prematurely.
.
However, what we failed to realise is that success is built over time, your love for you work, consistency & A LOT of grit.
.
For ppl that showed up but gave up, I hope you give it another try, another try & another try. Set small milestones instead of big goals and celebrate your small wins!!
.
What’s your recent small win? Share with me!
