This is too tempting for me not to have a bite. Made this brownie after 1 whole week of trying to gather all the necessary ingredients simply bec everything is OOS at the shops, had to rely on online purchases. Happy though we finally are able to make this a reality for ourselves ðŸ˜… love this recipe as shared by Missy's friend. Moist, bittersweet brownies just the way I love it.
