We heard your pleas and we are happy to announce that Flutes Delivery is now available 6 days a week (Tues-Sun)! It has been a great journey for us thus far, and definitely a steep learning curve for the team at Flutes as we first ventured into food delivery service back in April.

We had just 3 days to kick into action, learning and exploring how to provide the familiar Flutes experience to our friends and guests at home amidst fear and uncertainty in the community.

We are in this for the long run, but can't wait till the day when we can serve meals on plates and witness the smiles on faces at our tables again!
