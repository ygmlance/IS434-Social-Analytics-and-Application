18 May 2020 #Day42 of #circuitbreakersg: I went on to bake some cream puffs because i have cream left over. 😝 First attempt at choux pastry and I am so glad it is a successful bake!
.
I left some choux empty because i want to try ice cream puffs. Had a memorable ice cream choux in Japan since many years back when i visited (before the radiation!!) so I am looking forward to the relishing the taste 😄
