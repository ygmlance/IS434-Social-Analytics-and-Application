It's Japanese night again with ~ DIY SUSHI! This is lil Jae's favourite kind of meal coz he gets to assemble his own food! He especially eats more when we have diy sushi dinners ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ Simple array of ingredients ~ pan fried salmon, corn salad, teriyaki chicken, chicken floss and tamagoyaki! Pick and wrap our own sushiğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹ #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #sgparent #homecooking #sghomecooks #sginstagfood #japanesefood #circuitbreakersg #diysushi #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday42
