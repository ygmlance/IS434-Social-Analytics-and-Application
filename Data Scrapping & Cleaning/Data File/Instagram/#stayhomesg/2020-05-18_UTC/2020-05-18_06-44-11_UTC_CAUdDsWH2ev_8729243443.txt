Today, I decided that J1 shall help me with some house chores.

Me:”We are going to clean and mop the floor when didi naps.”
J1: “Ok, but can I play with water?”
Me:”hmmm.. Ya, if we have time after mopping.”
.
And then the brilliant mum came up with the idea of washing the waffle blocks as “waterplay”
.
Me:”Ok, you can play now.”
J1:”Where are my toys?”
Me:”Washing these blocks is waterplay!”
J1:”No, I want my toys.”
Me:”Erm.. ok, after you are done washing.”
.
I guess I can’t smoke her like this anymore.. 🤣 I asked her to wash the blocks with the cloth and she cane up with a brilliant idea. Swipe to watch the video.. Bth her!

Anyway she got her waterplay after washing 18 blocks. At least she gets the job done!

What a fruitful morning!

As I look at the picture, I am thankful I made the decision to convert our study (storeroom) into a play room just before J2 arrives! Its life-saving for me now during #circuitbreakersg The kids spend a lot of time playing in the room and most of the mess are contain inside!

Happy Monday!
