Breaking Circuit D42...
Flashback memory. I used to design my clothes. Mom executed all my ideas and added her own. Unique hodgepotch style. Always paired with heels and ear dangels!
Back to the future. Earhangers & high heels still there. Project recycle. Prototype. My new mask. New modern design. Extra set of eyes included in case my specs get foggy. It might get a bit smelly but hey, it is vampire resistent. The extra addition!
