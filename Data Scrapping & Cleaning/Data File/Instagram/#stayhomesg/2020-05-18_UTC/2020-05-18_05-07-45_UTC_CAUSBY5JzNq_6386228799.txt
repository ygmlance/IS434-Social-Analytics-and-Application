Lunch for the start of the week. A simple rice noodle salad with green leaf veggies, red peppers, aduki beans and hummus. I roasted a big batch of broccoli and cooked extra noodles so I can make another salad later this week. Remember cook more than you need and use it for another day ðŸ˜‰. Adzuki beans are high in fiber, protein and manganese, they can improve your heart, weight and muscle mass. @csnndistanceeducation  #lunchboxideas #buddhabowlrecipe #plantbasedlunch #easyplantbasedrecipes #plantbasednutritionist #plantbasednutrition #vegan #veganrecipes #healthegut #thecleanfoodist #cleanfood #comidasanayrica #cocinarconverduras #adzukibeans #fiberfoodsdiet #addfibertoyourdiet #fibra #cocinarencasa #stayhomesg #stayhome
