Finding things that spark joy during this #circuitbreaker 😁 Ordered the Putien x Tiger Sugar set - 2 of my favourites at $17.40, on Grabfood Putien restaurant! Probably only made possible with CB, this unlikely & heavenly pairing is god sent from the bubble tea gods. Decadent Brown Sugar Boba Milk with the umami Heng Hwa Bee Hoon topped with their signature chilli from this Michelin One star restaurant.. Yummmmss!

While the Smartypence did find this a tad expensive, we managed to bring the cost down by around 15% using the Grabfood vouchers we bought on Shopee. 
SmartyPence Tips💡
1) On the SHOPEE home page, scroll down to find FLASH DEALS (based on Smarty’s observations we see food vouchers released at 12pm) or simply search Grabfood or FoodPanda voucher in the search bar.
3) Choose the Grabfood or FoodPanda voucher denomination closest to your food bill
4) Pay for your Grabfood or FoodPanda voucher
5) Click “View Order Details”
6) Copy your voucher number – this is the ‘promo code’ when you check out on the Grabfood or FoodPanda platform.

You’re welcome! 😏
