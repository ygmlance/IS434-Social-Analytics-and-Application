LOL.. when we are bored, we played picnic in the Living room 😂😂 Getting into nature can be quite challenging. I perspired although there is no real sunlight coming in 🥵. I prepared some simple bruschetta snacks for our “Picnic”. Using toasted baguette, topped with bacon, spinach and Laughing Cow cheese wedges. 
Laughing cow wedges come with various flavours. We brought the assorted selections of herbs, emmental, praprika and light version cheese for them to spread on bread or just snack on its own. 
We are having so much fun and Laughing moo moo all the way especially taking this picture 🙈🥴 #stayhomebutshewantpicnic
