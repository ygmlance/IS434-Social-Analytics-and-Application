Have you checked in with your loved ones lately? Reach out and check in on your friends, even the ones who say they're doing fine. The simple act of reaching out can act as a simple reminder that you care.

If you want to take an extra step to check in on someone's mental health, you can try a different question that more explicitly asks after their psychological or emotional well being, like "how are you coping?", "what's been on your mind lately?", or anything else that suggests openness to a deeper conversation.
