Told mum I’m going to make a maggi burger but she’s suggested making [Curry Maggi Nest] instead and I think it looks pretty! 
What staying at home did to us - getting more and more creative now. 
#CooktheDifferencewithMAGGI #noodlenest #currynoodles #homecooksg #stayhomesg [Curry Maggi Nest] Recipe: 
Ingredients: 
1 packet of maggi noodles 
1 egg
Oil

➊ Cook the noodles for close to 2 mins, then drain away the water. 
➋ Toss the noodles evenly in half a packet of curry seasoning (feel free to use other flavours but curry is our favourite). ➌ Take an egg, separate the egg white and egg yolk. Pour the egg white into the noodles and mix well. 
➍ Grease the egg frying ring, heat oil in pan.

➎ Fill the frying ring with half portion of noodles (or as much as you like, mine is about 3/4 bowl of noodles) 
➏ Make a hole in the middle and pour in the egg yolk. Fry it for about 1-2 mins on medium heat. The bottom of the “nest” will have a slight crisp. 
➐ Serve and garnish.
