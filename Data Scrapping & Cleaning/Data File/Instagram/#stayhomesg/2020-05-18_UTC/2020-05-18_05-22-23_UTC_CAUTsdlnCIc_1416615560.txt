COVID19 Circuit Breaker period will be over in 2 weeks, hopefully...
This stay-home period has its challenges but it brings us more family time and most importantly, it helps many of us to realize the simplicity of happiness. We exercise, play toys, paint pictures, play piano, play computer games, fix LEGO and watch movies.üôÇ
These pictures will remind me, in time to come, how we got through this adversity together. ‚ù§Ô∏è #covid19circuitbreaker #sgunited #maskup #stayhomesg #staysafestayhome #homeactivities #bebetterthanyesterday #treasurethemoments #creatingmemories #clarelyx #joshualyz #jacoblyh #cherylhotraveldiary #sgmummy #motherof3 #familylifeambassador #mrssingaporeuniverse2014
