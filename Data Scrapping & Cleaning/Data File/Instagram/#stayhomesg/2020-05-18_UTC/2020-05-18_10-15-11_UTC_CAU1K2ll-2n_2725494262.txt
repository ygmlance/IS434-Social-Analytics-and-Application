"IN THIS TOGETHER"
We took the opportunity to participate in this really cute project having only found out late last night. 
Nevertheless, we hope you will thoroughly enjoy this mini production! We're delighted to share positive vibes with the community in the best way we know how. 
P.S: Can anyone guess where the OST came from??
