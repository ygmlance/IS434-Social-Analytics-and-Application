I was about to start experimenting with different chocolate chip cookies recipes to figure out how to make chocolate chip cookies just the way I like them. Luckily I came across a post by @tru_motiv which makes my job much easier.
P.S. this one is the one with granulated sugar only. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
all purpose flour, baking soda, salt, sugar, semi sweet chocolate chip cookies, milk, oil, vanilla extract
