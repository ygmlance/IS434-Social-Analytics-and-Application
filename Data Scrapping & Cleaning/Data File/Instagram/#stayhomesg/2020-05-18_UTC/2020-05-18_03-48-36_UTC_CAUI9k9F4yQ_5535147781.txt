We’ve been baking👩🏻‍🍳 A LOT at the moment and our recent favourites, these gooey chocolate brownies are courtesy the ‘bake-your-self’ kits by @whiskitcafe . ...
Pre-measured ingredients, and easy recipes that are delivered weekly to your home, these kits are great as activities to do with the tinies. What’s more, they tasted absolutely delicious too! 😍🙌
.
Some handy hints if you too want to bake some brownies of your own: ⠀⠀
👩🏻‍🍳🧈Always have all your ingredients ready and measured before you start making Brownies. Better still, subscribe to a ready-to-bake kit and have them do all the hard work for you! Also, don’t let your 6 year old crack eggs even if she says she’s a pro at it. 🤪
🥚Add an extra egg if you prefer your brownies more cake-y than fudgy.
🧂A pinch of salt is what will take your brownies from yummy to OMG amazing! 😍
🍫🍭Go to town with the variants in your fridge. We used M&M’s, chocolate and peanut butter on ours and they turned out soooo good! 😋Licking batter is part of being a good baker. Just remember not to lick it all off!
🍦Melt brownies in the microwave before teaming with icecream. And get the whole family to dig in!
