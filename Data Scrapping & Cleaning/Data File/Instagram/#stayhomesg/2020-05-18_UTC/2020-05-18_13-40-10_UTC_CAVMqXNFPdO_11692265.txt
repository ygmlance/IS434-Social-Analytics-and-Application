Coping with circuit breaker by putting on a lil’ performance in my own dining room. getting my island vibes on for @singforsg ! Here’s to all the people who missed their overseas travels or had to postpone like I did. I feel your disappointment and I see you. Let’s make this circuit breaker worthwhile. If you can spare 5 seconds, go on and like my performance on Sing for Singapore’s Facebook page. LINK IN BIO! 
I need to borrow all your influence my friends. Ask your families/friends/cell groups/colleagues/dog/cat/hamster/fish to like my Facebook so I can go on to the next round and perform for a good cause!
