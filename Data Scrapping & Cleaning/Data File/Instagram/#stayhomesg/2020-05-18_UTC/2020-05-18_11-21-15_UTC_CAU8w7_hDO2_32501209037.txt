We never expected that our first attempt at this dish would be this superb, and it did, simply because our mother's memory is as vivid as the image of our late grandfather in our minds.

Our mother recalled how her father had always persuaded her to try out his signature home-cooked dish, Ngoh Hiang, when she was in her twenties. However, mother was always caught up with chores and us children and hence, has never given a shot at this dish, nor did she manage to note down the ingredients and procedure.

Today, nearly 30 years have passed and seeing her grown up children, baking and cooking during this CB period, she encouraged us to craft out the dish she never did.

Just when we were about to go online to search for recipes, mother told us we should do it just as how her father had told her. Although she had never jotted down the recipe, she has paid careful attention to what grandfather said. Thus, recalling to the best of the her memory, she listed down what we needed and the steps to it.

Initially, we laughed about the matter, wondering how mother could be accurate in stating the procedure and ingredients after so many years. However, during our process of making the filling and rolling it up in the beancurd skin, mother's solemn tone and expression hinted us that we should take this dish seriously.

When the Ngoh Hiang came out rather flawlessly from the frying pan, we stared in awe, and were speechless at how good it tasted. "After all this time?" We asked our mother.
"I always remembered", she replied.

Although grandfather passed when we were very young, we know mother still misses him till this day. After all, her father was her best friend during her childhood, the one who drove her to school by motorbike, the one who hurried the stall uncle to prepare his daughter's breakfast when mother was being ignored for the other customers, the one who cracked jokes and made her childhood days lively.
