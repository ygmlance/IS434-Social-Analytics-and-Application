Day 42 of Circuit breaker.
Just like buying a blind box toy, sometimes I opened up to certain designs that I don't like.
Was planning to have this Mask Emoji surprise favours bun for snacks yesterday and I peel open to see  red bean paste in it not a chocolate bun that i was hoping to get ðŸ˜Š.
I put it back in to the bag and planned to make a savoury & sweet breakfast for today.
I cut open the bun & scooped out the red bean paste.
Layer with lettuce,  fried luncheon meat with the red bean paste, cheese,  Sunny side up egg & add a side salad with dried cranberries & tomatoes. ðŸ™‚
