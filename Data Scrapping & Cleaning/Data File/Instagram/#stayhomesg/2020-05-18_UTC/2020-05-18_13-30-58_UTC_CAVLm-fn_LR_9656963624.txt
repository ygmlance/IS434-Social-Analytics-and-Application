Although we are staying home and technically have more time to read, I realised that I am reading less than usual. I used to read during commute times, while waiting outside the school for my children to walk out or waiting for the food to arrive at restaurants. But all of these pockets of time are no longer there for me to luxuriously read.⁣
⁣
Having said that, I still do try to read and am very selective of what I spend time on reading and am intentional in how I read.⁣
⁣
For parenting books and non-fiction books that I read for learning and for information, these are my habits (a little shy to share but decided to document it here)⁣
⁣
👓  Speed read through the book once and put a star at those chapters that I find important and take my time to peruse through those later⁣
✏️ Have a pencil with me during the second time through the reading to write notes/underline/circle parts that are useful/practical/debatable⁣
📚 Have different books everywhere around house because these are visual reminders for me to read, and pick them up to read at any opportune time (in kitchen while waiting for the soup to boil, in the living room while my kids listen to audio stories, at the bedside table before bedtime)⁣
⁣
This is one of my current reads, it is my second reading of this book and rereading because I need to be reminded of how I speak with my children during their “stress-times" (and it has been more frequent during this circuit breaker) 🥴⁣
⁣
I generally enjoy Dr Daniel J. Siegel's books because they contain some geeky neuroscience bits and relate them to executable strategies that we can use in relating to our children.⁣ ~ S

How about you? What are your reading habits like? Any good reads to recommend?
