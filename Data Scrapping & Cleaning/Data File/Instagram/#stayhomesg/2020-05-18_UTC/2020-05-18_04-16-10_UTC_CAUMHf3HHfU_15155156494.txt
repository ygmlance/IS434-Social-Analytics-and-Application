Providing their needs, showering with love and care, appreciating individuality, nurturing their growth — none other than our mum who loves gardening and our family. .

Specially created this fully edible pot of rosemary to add on to her collection of plants, with the number of stalks representing our family members. It was her first time receiving such a birthday cake! 😝
Any plant lover would love this! 🌱
