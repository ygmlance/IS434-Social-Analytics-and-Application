Check out my....... OMU-MAGGI!

I got myself a freaking WINNER when it comes to whipping up a quick meal. The kids loved it so much, and Carter ranked it as his favourite meal😅

I used MAGGI chicken noodles🍜 since it’s their fave flavour!

All I did was sprinkle some of the flavour packet in some egg to make an omelette.

Top it with some cheese, cooked MAGGI noodles, and whatever leftovers you have (in this case I used chicken stir fry). Voila! Protein-rich instant noodles that is filling and a big hit for kids.

Ours? I topped it with Garlic Chill because I am addicted to the stuff at the moment🙌🏻
