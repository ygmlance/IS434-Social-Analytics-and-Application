Who eats Ba Ku Teh like me 😀 not adding Dao pok , fried you tiao or mushroom ... today I add 淮山 Chinese yam. It is a very nutritious root that is eaten as a tonic dish u see that a lot in Japanese cuisine too ( like a potato texture after cooking but much more nutrition value ) Good to strengthen your spleen . Nourish the lung / kidney , aid in digestion . Lots of antioxidants, slow down Aging & also help in weight lost n many more . Parents can try adding this to their toddler porridge / soup as a replacement for potato 🥔 ( for recipe go to highlight under “Ba Ku teh” )#shalalacook #cheflalaou #huaishan #chineseyam #bakuteh #singaporefood #stayhomesg #stayhomewithascott
