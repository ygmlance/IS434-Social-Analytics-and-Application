Circuit breaker Day 42: Fried rice from Wok Hey! 👍👍 Simple but yummy fried rice with good wokhei haha. Love that they use short grain rice (I love short grain rice), makes the fried rice more unique compared to those you get at zichar stores. $21.40 for these 3 (2 x Shanghai beef fried rice, 1 x Egg fried rice with prawn) not the cheapest of fried rice but still good for a portion that’s is very substantial. I like the cut of beef they use, not difficult to chew/rubbery at all. This is the kind of go-to food when you’re at work, without any food cravings and just want something quick & easy.
📍Wok Hey (Compass One - but there are quite a few outlets around)
