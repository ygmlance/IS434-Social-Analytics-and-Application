Lyrics of In this Together
.
(Verse)
Feelin’ low and down
Discouraged by this senselessness
But no hopelessness will stop us now

Keep your spirits up, Singapore!
‘Cause there’s no better way
No other way
We're better together
.
(Chorus)
In this together
We're in this together
Stronger we'll be
As one big family

In this together
We’re in this together
Distance apart, but not in our hearts
SGUnited!
