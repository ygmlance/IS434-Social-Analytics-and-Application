You grow girl! 🌿

Spent yesterday afternoon repotting my little balcony garden. By repotting i mean that I killed half my plants from forgetting to water them then killed the other half by over watering them as a way to apologize (kill them with kindness?🤷🏼‍♀️). To prevent root rot which, is apparently a thing when a plant sits in it’s own water too long, I had to do the great repotting. All was fine and well until the kids discovered how to make mud and proceeded to give themselves a mud bath on the balcony while I was elbow deep in cacti getting attacked by a bunch of little pricks. Ninety minutes and five bucket loads of water to clean the kids and surrounding area I was done. But yes, now I’m feeling a bit of root rot… the human kind….where one sits on their ass in their own pot (i.e. house) for too damn long. Need to free these feet and get some good sun and water time in… pool anyone? Ah yes, two more weeks. .

Other plan inspired puns/alternate captions: Long thyme no see. I’m very frond of you. I’m rooting for you. .
