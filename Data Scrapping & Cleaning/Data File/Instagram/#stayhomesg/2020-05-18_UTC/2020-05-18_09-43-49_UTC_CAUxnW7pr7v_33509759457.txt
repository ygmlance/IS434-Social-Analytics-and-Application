It’s clear that masks are going to be with us for a while. Whether it’s a sleek black fabric mask or a bright-hued floral mask cover, you can stay safe and stylish while supporting local makers with one of these creations by @oliveankara, @cocoonese, @independentmarketsg and @lovesg.sg.

Even better: nab a reusable mask via @lovesg.sg or their stockist @naiise and, for each mask sold, one will be donated to Masks Sewn With Love or the Migrant Workers' Centre.
