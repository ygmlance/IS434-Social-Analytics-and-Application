What has covid-19 taught you? For me, It has taught me how to be more mindful of what we need and don’t need, and how homecooked meals are actually the best! Albeit we need some lil pleasures in life (mostly yummy food for my family). ☺️ besides, if you’re working from home, demarcating where you work is also important! So no distractions, and no working from bed cos that’s the space that is for your beauty sleep. Your mind will be confused whether you are supposed to be asleep or working when in bed. 😴 hoping you guys are having a lovely week :) 💚A 🦋
