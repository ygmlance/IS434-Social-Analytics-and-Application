I couldn’t find an ice-cream scoop at home although I swear we had one. So a thought struck me - how about slicing through the cardboard container of The Dark Gallery’s “Sea Salt Butterscotch” ice-cream itself? And guess what, it worked like a dream and my plated dessert didn’t look half bad in the end, if I may say so myself 😌😆.
If you fancy a bit of fun and a delectable sweet treat some time during the remainder of this #CircuitBreaker (or beyond), why not #DiscoverTheDarkAtHome with the NEW Ice Cream Brownie Family Pack from @discoverthedark? It comes with 2 pints of their popular ice cream in “Signature 80% Dark Chocolate” and the aforementioned “Sea Salt Butterscotch“, 4 slabs of dark chocolate brownies, a bottle of chocolate sauce and some chocolate soil. More than enough “art materials” for you to let loose and get creative with. Who knows? #JacksonPollock may have nothing on you! .

Thank you @pahqifan for arranging this delivery 😊
