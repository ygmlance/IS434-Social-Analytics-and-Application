Woohoo! It's Tasty Thursday! So, one of the things I find hard to resist is definitely ice-cream! What are your favourite flavours when it comes to ice-cream? It’s my mission to always try the dark chocolate flavour whenever I try a new brand & I did the same for @carraracafesg!

@carraracafesg's gelato is handcrafted from scratch in small batches & contains no eggs, no gelatine, no preservatives & no artificial colouring or flavouring! Gelato also generally contains less fat compared to ice-cream so you can feel less guilty binging of gelato! 🤣

I picked the flavours that appealed to me which was Belgian Dark Chocolate, D24 Durian & Oolong Osmanthus! The texture of the gelato is smooth & it isn't too sweet! My favourite out of the 3 would have to be the D24 durian because it's super shiok & it's like eating smooth, creamy durian out of a pint! 🤤

The Belgian Dark Chocolate is definitely dark. I looooved the intense bitter chocolatey goodness!
.
The Oolong Osmanthus has a really strong Oolong flavour & it's the lightest out of the 3 flavours that I picked. 😂 If you're suffering from BBT withdrawals, how about having some tea gelato instead? 😉

Another cool part is, you can customise a message on the pint if you're gifting it to friends or family! It adds a warm touch (ironic but true since you're sending gelato. 😂) that I'm sure many would appreciate! 👍🏻
.
Each pint is $13.90 (classic flavours) & $16.90 (premium flavours) & it's free delivery for a min. spending of $35 for nearby areas & $65 for islandwide!

Feel free to whatsapp your orders to 90271679 if you're looking for your next gelato fix! 😉

5 more days till the end of CB everyone! We can do this! Remember to stay home whenever you can even when CB is over! The lesser the number of cases, the faster we get through this! Stay healthy & take care! 💪🏻
