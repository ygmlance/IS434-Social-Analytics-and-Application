😋Taste: 9/10. Difficult to go wrong with fresh crabs. Killing 1kg crabs was a first for us, and we struggled (but still keeping humane). But once that was done, the sauces were pretty straightforward. Although both came out too thin (too generous with water; too stingy with butter and corn flour), the taste was on point. Overall utterly delicious and completely satisfying!
