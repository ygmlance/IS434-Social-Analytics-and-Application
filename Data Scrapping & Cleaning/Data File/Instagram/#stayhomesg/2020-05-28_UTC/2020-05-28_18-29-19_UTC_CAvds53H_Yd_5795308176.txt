This #CircuitBreaker has helped me rediscover my @lecreusetsg.
Being a working mom means quick meals and I have standard "tools" for each type of dish.
One pot rice - rice cooker
Soup - Dutch oven
Roasted dish - convection oven
.
In another words, my beloved LC wasn't maximised to it's fullest.
So I attempted the LC Claypot rice.
I may have overestimated the liquid a little, otherwise, it was perfect! (Not my words)
