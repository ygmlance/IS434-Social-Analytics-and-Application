Feisty, fearless, creative, smart as a whip and good-hearted, @maira.yeo is a professionally-trained pastry chef with years of experience who recently decided, since she had time on her hands, to apply her skills to supporting two causes: @healthservesg and @r.syaz1‚Äôs #umbrellainitiativesg. 80% of profits from her bake sale are to be divided equally between them.
A wealth of work experience at restaurants here as well as abroad where she spent a good part of last year traveling and ‚Äústaging‚Äù at restaurants in New York, Montreal and Oslo, you can be sure whatever she produces for her fundraising exercise is truly scrumptious and not run-of-the-mill stuff.
I ordered a batch each of her Crackly Chocolate Brownie Cookie and Pecan Miso Brown Butter #Cookie at $4 a piece. Their flavours were terrific. While I enjoyed the former‚Äòs salt-sprinkled crisp exterior and soft, chewy middle, the latter appealed with its mildly savoury taste profile and crunchy pecan nuts. By the way, for those of you who avoid sweet food, I have good news - Chef Maira‚Äôs creations are a lot lower in sugar than most. 
She‚Äòd also kindly added two Olive Oil Lemon Yogurt Loaves to my bag - they turned out to be a delight too. If lemon-flavoured desserts interest you, this is something you ought to try. And because she bakes them scaled down to fit in the palm of a hand, the bright-tasting cake looks extra darling üòç (price: $5). I recommend sliding into her DMs ASAP and ordering a bunch of her superb baked goods when they are next available (yes, she is getting increasingly popular). Knowing you are contributing to two good causes while you munch away will surely double the satisfaction.
