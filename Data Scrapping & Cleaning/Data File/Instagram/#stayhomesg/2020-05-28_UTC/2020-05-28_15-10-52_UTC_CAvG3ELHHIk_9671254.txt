When we were so grateful that there's no community quarantine here in Singapore and days slowly progressed to what was happening to the rest of the world. We love our  outdoor family time--- watching ants, playing ball and just laughing at each other. We (now) love being indoors just the same but we're sooo looking forward to the days that have been only a few months ago. This may resurface only after we don't know when but we're hopeful. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
