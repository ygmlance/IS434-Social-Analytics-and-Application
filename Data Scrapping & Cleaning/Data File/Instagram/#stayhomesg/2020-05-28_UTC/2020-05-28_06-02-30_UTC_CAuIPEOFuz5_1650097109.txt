Before the pandemic hit, and made the world of physical surfaces and contact a dangerous place. The #mappingfear project was once an interactive art installation. I had just received a grant from @nacsingapore to install this work across sites in Singapore when covid hit. Over a few weeks, and with a tremendous amount of help from @ohcy , I remade this project into a digital version.
