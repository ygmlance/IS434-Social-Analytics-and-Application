In this video, they share about how 1 metre looks like, how to wear and remove mask, how to take a quick breather when wearing a mask, and many more!

Watch till the end for a giveaway of 2 kid size face masks! Thank you @tracyeinny ❤️. Thank you @moesingapore for all the work that you have done in preparation for school reopens. This is our little contribution so we can all do our part and return to school safely. :)
