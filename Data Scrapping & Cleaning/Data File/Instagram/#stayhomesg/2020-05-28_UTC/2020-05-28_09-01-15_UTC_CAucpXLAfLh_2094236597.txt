𝗗𝗜𝗗 𝗬𝗢𝗨 𝗞𝗡𝗢𝗪?⁠
⁠
A government-mandated standard contract for migrant workers does 𝗻𝗼𝘁 address issues including long working hours, poor living conditions and enforced confinement😱Furthermore, instead of guaranteeing one day off per month and a set number of rest hours per day for these migrant workers, it is an issue that needs to be negotiated between the employer and themselves🤨⁠
⁠
Is this considered fair treatment towards these migrant workers? Is the Singapore government really doing enough to take care of their needs?🤔⁠
