#stayhomesg “This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, received from the Almighty: If his children are multiplied, it  is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. Those who survive him shall be buried in death, And their widows shall not weep, Though he heaps up silver like dust, And piles up clothing like clay— He may pile it up, but the just will wear it, And the innocent will divide the silver. He builds his house like a moth, Like a booth which a watchman makes. The rich man will lie down, But not be gathered up; He opens his eyes, And he is  no more. Terrors overtake him like a flood; A tempest steals him away in the night. The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; It sweeps him out of his place. It hurls against him and does not spare; He flees desperately from its power. Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.
Job 27:13‭-‬23 NKJV
