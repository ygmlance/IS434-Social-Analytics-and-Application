S$10 for Salmon & Ikura Don topped with Tobiko and seasoned jellyfish. To make the deal even more unbelievable, there’s an additional 15% off if you self-collect. (Say What?!)😮🍣

Taste-wise, it is not your traditional Salmon Don. It more like a fast-food kinda style with a modern twist. The only gripe for me was that I wished the sushi rice was fluffier - but then again, for the value - it’s pretty unbeatable.🍱
