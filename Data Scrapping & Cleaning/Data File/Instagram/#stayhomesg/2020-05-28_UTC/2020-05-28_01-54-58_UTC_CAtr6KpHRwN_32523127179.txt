😋Taste: 8/10. Love the tang and texture that sourdough offers baked goods, and this was no exception! Also a great way of using up discard (#nofoodwaste #sourdoughdiscardrecipe)! That said, while a solid staple, it’s not particularly memorable. Next time we might try to make it slightly fluffier, and perhaps incorporate fruits like bananas and blueberries.

P.S. can you tell we tried to arrange it as close to the pancake emoticon 😅
