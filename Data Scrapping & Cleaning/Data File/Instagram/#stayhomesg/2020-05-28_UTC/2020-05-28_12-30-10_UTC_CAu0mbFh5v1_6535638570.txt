Gosh my family and I had a huge wanton mee feast and our bellies were so satisfied! @being1ton has been my go to place for wanton mee ever since I was in primary school and it has been my favourite ever since. Thereâ€™s nothing like a good bowl of egg noodles in dark sauce, along with char skew and fried wantons. You can even order ala carte items to share like chicken katsu, frjed shrimp dumplings and dumplings with sauce ðŸ¥Ÿ Their prices are also super affordable, with wanton mees starting from $4 and nasi lemak from $1.80. They provide islandwide delivery, whatsapp +65 9046 7176 to order!â €
