Are we in different stages in life goaded by certain principle? But we all have same beginning and ending?

The psychology of humans is goaded by certain principles, that of cows by other principles, and that of vultures by still other principles. Each follows a particular path.

Suppose a human beings dies of smallpox or cholera. A vulture will not die if it eats a human body which is infected with either disease. If, on the other hand, a man eats the flesh of a person who has died of cholera, he will almost certainly die. This is because the plexi of human beings and those of vultures are different. - PR sarkar
