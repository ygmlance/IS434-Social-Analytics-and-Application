HBL Activity - Pour, Sort and Eat!
â €
Building fine and gross motor with food! The kid loves this as she can snack on her favourite cereals anytime. Eat and donâ€™t need to sort. Smart ya. â €
â €
We started the activity with pouring the cereal into a bowl. Naturally she moved on to sorting her colours and eventually the chocolate ones went into her tummy! ðŸ˜‹ â €
â €
Try moving on to fine motor skills with spoon, tweezer and chopsticks! They make great tools for sharpening these important skills! â €
