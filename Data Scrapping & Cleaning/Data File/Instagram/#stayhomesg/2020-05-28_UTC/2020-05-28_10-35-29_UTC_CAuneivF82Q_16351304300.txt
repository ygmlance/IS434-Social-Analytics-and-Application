If you’re always on the lookout for affordable alcohol, you would have heard of SMÖÖbar. We spoke with Alvin, the man behind SMÖÖbar and here’s what he has to say! ‘We first started from a bar at SMU called SMÖÖbar with the aim of providing affordable drinks and quality food for students. Afterwhich, we expanded to Prinsep and came up with our a variety of funky towers and Mentaiko dishes which includes fries and mains.’ The COVID-19 period has been tough on us. Sales have dipped by more than 90% and we have had to change the way we operate. We are now providing delivery services which includes free island-wide (with minimum spend). Choosing to look at things more positively, Alvin also mentioned that the circuit breaker gave him some time to think about what else could be offered to customers. He has also had some extra time to rest up and consolidate further plans. In fact, he managed to open up a new brand Rambürger, which operates as a local fast food chain which offers curly fries and drink to every set meal such as burgers, fried chicken and nuggets.  SMÖÖbar is open for takeaways and island-wide delivery.
