#KisahKoolcats: G has been asking for a mask that is hand embroidered with his name since he saw me making it for my sisters. I finally made the mask in black cat print and embroidered his name in bright orange for a contrast. While at it, I also made a mask in camo print and lined it with cat print cotton. ðŸ˜º Both fabric masks do not have any raw seams and are fitted with an inner pocket for slotting in surgical mask or filter. (This was a personal project; Kedai Koolcats is neither selling fabric face masks nor taking requests for personalised ones. However, you can get a free mask with every item purchase from KedaiKoolcats.com!)
