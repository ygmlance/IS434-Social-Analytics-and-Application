There’s a new (and free!) full-colour story and activity book for kids - Learning Through COVID-19 🎈

It’s a gorgeous book that’s so colourful and fun for kids, a pretty cool way to educate the lil ones about why their world has changed so greatly.

Chloe is busy decorating her paper mask 😷 They’re giving 5 Toys R Us $300 vouchers to the best designs!

You can visit @peopleupsg to get your own free kids book. But they have a limited release...... so fastest fingers first ✌🏻
