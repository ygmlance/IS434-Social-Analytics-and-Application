Today after a chat with friends, I got inspired to bake a strawberry shortcake. Everything is actually quite easy to achieve but getting the whipped cream consistency right is tough. For a first try, I think it's great. Probably need to reduce sugar for the sponge since we will be brushing it with syrup.

Definitely wanna make this again to perfect it.
