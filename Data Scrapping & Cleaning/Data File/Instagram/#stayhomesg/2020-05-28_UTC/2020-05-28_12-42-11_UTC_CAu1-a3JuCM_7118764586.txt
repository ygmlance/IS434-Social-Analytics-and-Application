How are you guys doing now that circuit breaker is ending?? 👋😄 How about using the remaining precious time to catch up with friends before returning back to our daily routine? 💁🏻‍♀️ .

Bunch of #ahlahs @cakesmakemehigh @fanana @fullofjoyys met up virtually online for our usual yakking session (which lasted for one and half hours 😹) and as usual, old habits die hard and they made fun of my enunciation (enunciated “caste” as “casket”, okay wtffff 😂🙈) but I must say that this is why friends are important especially in a difficult time like this because it keeps us sane and grounded! 🙆🏻‍♀️❤️ .

Special mention to my makeshift #Ahlahs t-shirt as well lolol 🤦🏻‍♀️ P.S. Pardon messy hair and bare face 😅
