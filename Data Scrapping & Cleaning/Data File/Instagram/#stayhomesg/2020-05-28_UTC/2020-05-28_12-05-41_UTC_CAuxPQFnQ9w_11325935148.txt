We are delighted that our prints can bring you some bloom in the midst of the gloom. We’ll like to give everyone who supported our mask pre-orders a big shout out and thanks for supporting our cause! ⁠
⁠
To date, we’ve raised $4800 for 6 COVID funds and we are opening another pre-order tomorrow at 12pm with all profits going to 2 COVID funds supporting our migrant workers!⁠
