This drawing is inspired by a recent client’s call. This was my vision of her life and her progress in the last 3.5 years.

When she first came to me, she was often in low moods and had little joy and purpose in her life. I told her to have more self care. To love herself more. To read books that uplift. And to meditate to ground herself. She told me a few days ago that her life has improved tremendously. Despite this pandemic, she is able care for herself more by spending time to deepen her spiritual pursuit. She’s one amazing lady who has transformed herself from the ashes of life and ready to take on more than ever. .

In my vision (as drawn in the picture), she was discarding a thick stubborn mess of dishevelled hair. It represented her past of clouded thinking and heavy burdensome thoughts. Good riddance! And in came a big bouquet of balloons! Congratulating her of the good work she has put in. What an affirmation for her!

Do you want to feel light and joyful? To take in life fully without dread? Meditation is one of the pillars to creating a joyful and grounded life. .
