“If you can’t take care of yourself, how are you going to take care of somebody else?” Catch Episode 2 of “A Dose of Spirituality”, an interfaith COVID-19 where our Retreat Directors speak about how different religions view self-care and how we can take care of ourselves. Ustaz Mizi Wahid, ends the retreat with a guided reflection on how well we have been taking care of ourselves and what else we can do.
