“Spelt is richly supplied with nutrients. In general, it is higher in protein, fat, and fiber than most varieties of wheat. One of the few foods which Chinese medicine attributes with directly nourishing the heart-mind.” Paul Pitchford, Healing with Wholefoods.

Homemade Spelt Pasta [Ingredients]
-2 cups spelt flour
-3 eggs
-2 tbsp olive oil
-1/4 cup all-purpose flour
-1.5 litre water + 1 tsp olive oil (for cooking)
[Steps]
-Empty spelt flour onto a countertop or a bowl. Create a well about 15cm wide
-Add eggs and oil into the well. Mix the flour into the well carefully with a fork. Once all the eggs are incorporated, knead the dough with your hands for 8-10mins until firm, no dry dough. Add 1 tsp of water if it’s too dry and continue kneading until firm. Cover with a bowl and let dough rest for 30 mins
-After resting, divide dough into 6 equal pieces and work into ball. Work on one dough at a time, cover the rest
-Flour dough and put it through a pasta roller machine (widest setting). Next, fold into 3 (round corners folded towards the middle), flour, and roll through again. Repeat this step 3 times. Flour dough if it’s sticky to prevent pasta from getting stuck in the machine
-Turn to the next setting (narrower) and roll through once. Repeat this step at every setting until desired thickness.
-If you are using a KitchenAid (@kitchenaidsingapore) pasta maker start with setting 1 and work your way to setting 5.
-Flour pasta sheets with all-purpose flour to prevent pasta from sticking together
-Roll pasta sheet through a pasta cutter or fold and cut pasta with a knife
-Add more flour to the pasta noodles to separate noodles
-Put a pot of water and olive oil to boil
-Add pasta and let cook for 3-4 mins. Drain and rinse with cold water
-Serve with your favorite pasta sauce
