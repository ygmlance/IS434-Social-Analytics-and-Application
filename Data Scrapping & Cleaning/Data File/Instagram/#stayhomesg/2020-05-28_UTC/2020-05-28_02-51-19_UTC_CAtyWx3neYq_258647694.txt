Baby Cayler is not as “privileged” as his big brother as we are not able to do a proper newborn photoshoot by @vinkiho_photography.

But to be fair to both princes, we still proceed with our DIY newborn photoshoot in the comfort of our home and making use of whatever props which we have (cos we didn’t expect the CB to be extended). The process was fun. I got to learn swaddling and wrapping the baby Cayler but most of the times he’s crying (haha...) when he’s full or half-naked. And thanks to Vinki’s guidance to take different poses and angles but still not an easy feat if baby Cayler is awake and moving his hands. You know what I meant when we have to “pose fast, snap fast”!
