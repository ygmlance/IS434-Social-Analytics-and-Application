I would say that it feels like it was just yesterday, that we were ecstatic for a new decade. But it doesn't. The past two months have crawled by. 😪⁠⠀

But here we are, battling not only a deadly virus, but a recession forecasted to be the worst since our independence. 📉⁠⠀

𝐘𝐞𝐭, 𝐰𝐞 𝐦𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐨𝐧, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐰𝐞 𝐌𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐛𝐞 𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐟𝐮𝐥! 🙏🏽 As of 26 May 2020, the number of new Covid-19 cases in the USA was 16,700. The number of new cases in Singapore, was 383! #gratitude ⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
With the four stimulus packages that have been released, we must spend it wisely, and not hold it back! We must support our economy. ⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Let's continue playing our parts in social distancing and only going out for essentials. It is only when we do this together, can we emerge victorious. ⁠⠀
