Voice is a powerful sound healing tool to balance our energy centres (chakras) in our body.
💢
We have 7️⃣ main chakras. The throat chakra represents communication. When it is balanced, we are open-minded, can see the truth and express ourselves freely.
😄 
In our last Reiki sound healing session, we used the "Ham" sound together with other sound healing instruments alongside Reiki energies to balance the throat chakra. Tomorrow, we will target healing for the 6th chakra - third eye 👁, which represents vision.
