The third episode of Iso.Date is airing May 29 at 6pm SG time / 5pm BKK!
⠀
Our daters this week are M. and A. in Singapore. We’re hiding their names until we go live. 
But you definitely don’t want to miss this!
⠀
On this LIVE reality dating show and social experiment, Coconuts TV will be broadcasting blind dates between strangers who are stuck at home during the pandemic, but still looking for love.
⠀
Will sparks fly? Or will the cringe be unbearable? We really don’t know, and that’s sort of the point. This is live romantic dating action, you guys! ⠀
Grab some popcorn, get your commenting keyboard fingers ready, and tune in 🍿😍
