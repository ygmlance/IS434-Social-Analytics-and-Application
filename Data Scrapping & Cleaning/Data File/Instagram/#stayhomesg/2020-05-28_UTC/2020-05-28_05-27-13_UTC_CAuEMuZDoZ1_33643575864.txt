Stigma is a big reason why a lot of people don't ask for help for their own mental health. We don't want to be judged for seeking treatment, or seen as weak because we can't manage on our own. But just as you wouldn't try to heal your own broken leg, you shouldn't avoid seeking out a professional for your mental health. We'll be discussing more about this topic this coming Saturday. If you'd like to ask questions, make sure to join us on our live zoom session by registering on our website, www.calmcollective.asia.
