#B4IMGONE Song Challenge

AHOY! My song takes a soulful direction with my favourite Indonesian rudeboy with a voice that makes us all love him before he's gone. 
Name: @DennyFrust

Country: Indonesia 
Love me #B4IMGONE:  Denny Frust surely is no stranger in the massive Indonesian Reggae scene, with rich East Nusa Tenggara & East Java blood running through his veins he has been dubbed the Indonesian Prince of Ska by the masses. He gained his fame early on with Jakarta based Ska band, MONKEY BOOTS releasing two albums - penning most of the lyrics for the band. Wanting to explore beyond Ska to Rocksteady, Soul, Gospel and beyond, Denny Frust released a mini album called Tiada Beban and received critical acclaim in the Indonesian music scene. Taking his signature vocals and explosive performance style on the road, Denny toured and took it international, gaining new fans in  Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and as far as Belarus. An artist of the people, with a universal message, 
Fave #DennyFrust "Jangan Lupa Bahagia": The song title translates to "Don't forget to be happy", and that sums up Denny Frust to me, simple universal truths we forget from his soul to yours. Also check out his cover of John Holt's 'Police and Helicopters' on youtube. ---
