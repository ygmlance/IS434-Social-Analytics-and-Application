I had a bottle of Hae Bee Hiam (Dried Prawn Sambal) from the last batch I did and decided it was time to clear it out for a new batch.

Hae Bee Hiam is a versatile dish that goes well with porridge, rice or even bread. 
You can keep the unfinished portion in air-tight bottles refrigerated and it can last for weeks.

It can also be used to stir-fry vegetables like the one I did today.
