â€˜looking back at times before the Covid, even before we have moved to Neo Tiew. 
Lets take a walk on memory lane to the times where everything was still as it is. 
Our plot in Murai has held many memories for us especially our little retail stall that is nestled right in the heart of the farm. It has seen many generations of customers right from the start where Senior Mr Liao started the farm right till JJ . It has almost a history of 2 decades in the making. 
During the covid period, other than working to source our customers more fresh produces, we are also in the making of having this little retail nook up again. It takes a pandemic to make us appreciate the outdoors and being able to enjoy the bounty of nature once again. 
Watch for this space as we bring you something new.
