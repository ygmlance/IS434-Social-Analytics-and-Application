Let's try a sentient diet for 21 days, and tell me your experience!

In all cases where a patient has been ailiing for a long time, experienced physicians advise complete rest for a minimum of 21 days to allow the growth of new, healthy cells so that the ailing person will regain physical and mental energy.

Cells are affected by food and water, nature of the cells affects the nature of the human mind, we should eat the correct diet that is helpful for both body and mind, we call it sentient food!
