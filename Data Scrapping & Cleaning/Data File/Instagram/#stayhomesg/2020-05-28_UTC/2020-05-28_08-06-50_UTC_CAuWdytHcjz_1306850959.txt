☀️Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow.☀️ A gentle reminder for us to stay optimistic during this period and things shall improve very soon! Let’s pray and hope that other countries are recovering well too so that we can all travel safely in December! 🤩 Today, I’m eating Gardenia bread but I don’t want to just eat plain boring bread. So I decided to recreate my bread into a pedestrian crossing and invite the world’s most famous pedestrians- The Beatles to cross my kind-of Abbey Road! 🤩🤩🤩 Again, so challenging to draw these 4 famous personalities because I have to make sure they keep a decent distance between each other and wear nice skinnies or bell bottoms! 🤣🤣🤣 Since I’m recreating their famous album cover on Abbey Road, I also have more breads as pavements and smashed hard boiled eggs as trees. 🤣🤣🤣 It’s such a fun and filling breakfast because I ended up having 4 slices of egg mayo sandwiches! I hope this foodart brings a smile to all Beatles fans! Happy Thursday! ☀️☀️☀️🥳🥳🥳
