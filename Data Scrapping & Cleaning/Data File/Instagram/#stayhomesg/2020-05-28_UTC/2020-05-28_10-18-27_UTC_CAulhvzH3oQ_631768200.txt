Day 52 Circuit breaker dinner.
I already have my fixed of brown rice barley meal in the morning.
So I have take away food for dinner today.
My favourite Wu Xiang Guan Chang from my favourite stalls.
They have left out my ordered of Guan Chang 灌肠 Sausages & century egg 皮蛋。
Nevermind 就当作他们替我减肥吧。
Anyway they are generous enough to give me extra bag of chilli sauce.
Having my dinner with this Haus Brew Yuzu Jasmine tea. Very refreshing to go with this dinner. Not too sweet. 😊
