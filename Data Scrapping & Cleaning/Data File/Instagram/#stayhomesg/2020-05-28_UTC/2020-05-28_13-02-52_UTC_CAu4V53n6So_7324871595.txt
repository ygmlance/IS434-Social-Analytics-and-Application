A new portrait hoop with a familiar busy bee! 🥰 After a whole month of craziness (new govt regulations every week, website launch, Mother’s Day sets and collabs), I finally can focus on your custom orders! 🙆🏻‍♀️ I took a teeny tiny break in between and I’m already feeling much more rested. Hope you guys are all coping well at home! It seems like we can see the light at the end of the tunnel soon ❤️
