Nyonya Fishhead Curry

Fishhead Curry is one of the most well-known and sort after dishes in Singapore and Malaysia.

There are a few variations - Indian, Malay, Chinese and Nyonya - each having their own unique blend of spices going into making that fiery pot of curry.

My version is the Nyonya version which has coconut milk added to the fragrant  blended spices which has been slow fried over medium heat. The conbination of rich coconut milk and aromatic spices leaves you with a lemak pot of curry.
