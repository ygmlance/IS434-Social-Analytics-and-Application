Our most rugged soap.‚Å†

Made with real Guinness Stout, just less the alcohol. üòãPrior to making this bar, the alcohol is boiled off leaving just the goodness of hops, barley and yeast, all unbelievable great ingredients even for our skin.‚Å†‚†Ä

What's more, it doesn't just contain beer, it looks like the real thing with the dark stout below and the beer froth foaming over. üòâ‚Å†

You ask... Lavender with Stout? Well, the scent of this bar is unmistakably masculine. So anyone who loves a stronger, bolder scent, male or female will appreciate this bar.‚Å†
