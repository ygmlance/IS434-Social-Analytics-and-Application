I was watching the prediction done by @abhigyaanand for 2020-2021 and the summary is that : 
1. Corona will slow down from 30th June 2020..
2. Corona may come again in december 2020.
3. Economy will collapse. Economy will revive in November 2021.
4. May have food crisis
5. International distress will happen.

Hopefully everything wouldn’t go as what he predicted and this will go away really soon thou! Apart from that, here’s one photo I shot with @ooo_lin_ooo the other time over at @artsciencemuseumsg and slide right for more visuals ~
