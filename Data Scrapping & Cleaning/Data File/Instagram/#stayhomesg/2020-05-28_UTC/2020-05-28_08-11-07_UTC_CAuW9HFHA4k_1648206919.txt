This is a story of how simple things can be amazingly delicious. The name “Ayam Panggang” basically translates to “Roast Chicken”, which in this case refers to a whole spring chicken roasted over open flames.

First we construct the marinate, which is a mixture of fresh and dry spices - nothing too uncommon here. Then we season the chicken and let it rest overnight, to ensure that all that flavour and goodness has seeped through and through.

Like most dishes, the formula to this great tasting Ayam Paggang is the cooking time. Too short and the meat won't get enough of that flame grilled goodness. Too long and you get meat that has flavour, but is dry and not a pleasure to bite into.

So balance in this case is important. When you bite into the chicken, you'll get that juicy succulent texture, flame grilled flavour, and aroma from all those spices that have been working their magic overnight.

Definitely one of the underrated dishes in the menu, and we hope you get the chance to try this out !
