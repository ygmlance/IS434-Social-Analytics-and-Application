Beef Ramly Burger

I did Beef Ramly Burger for dinner. My friend forwarded me the recipe and asked me to take up the challenge to replicate Ramly burger. 
I couldn’t do it right away as I couldn’t find burger buns. It seems that it’s sold out everywhere. Finally I perched myself this morning at a bakery store to wait for it. Yes, I got it. 
Ramly Burger is commonly found in Singapore and Malaysia especially pasar malam. 
Then again it is an easy to make burger. 
Have used beef patties, maggi seasoning, A1 sauce, mayo, chilli sauce. The uniqueness of Ramly burger is that the patty wrapped in an omelette on toasted butter bun. Added onions and sliced tomatoes on it. 
When you sink your teeth into the burger, the sauces are all oozing out and it could be messy but yummy. 😊
