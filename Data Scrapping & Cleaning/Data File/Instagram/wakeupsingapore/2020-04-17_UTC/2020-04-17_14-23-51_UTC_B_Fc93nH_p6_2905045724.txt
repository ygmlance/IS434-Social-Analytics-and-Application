Now may be a good time to revisit Minister Vivian's  famous speech... "When a mistake is made, just come clean and say so. But don't cover up. That's why I have not let this go, because it is not about cleanliness of the ceiling, it is about clean politics and I appeal to you, because I know you to be an honourable man, I appeal to you, go back, do a thorough investigation of what's gone on and what's gone wrong in your town council and put it right, set it right." Will we hold foreign worker employers to the same standards?
