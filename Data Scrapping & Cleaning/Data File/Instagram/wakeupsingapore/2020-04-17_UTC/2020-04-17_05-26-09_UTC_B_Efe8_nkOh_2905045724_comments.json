If you look at the data, the cases of singaporean locals getting infected is pretty stable , it's the migrant worker infection rates that demand more attention and action because it's out of control. If you cross reference it to the titanic meme post it  becomes clearer what they were implying, or at least that's how I see it . Also with all do respect,  I think you may have misunderstood the article. An average refers to the central number in the set . It doesn't necessarily  mean that everyday for last week that the number had been 38, correct me If I'm wrong.  The daily local infections would tend to dip and increase , which is why I think they choose to compare the average daily infections  per week  to paint a more accurate picture and to eliminate any anomalies like sudden increases and decreases. While I don't think that an average decrease of 1 is very significant, it proves that on some levels that the CB measures for local singaporeans  have been pretty successful at preventing further increase in caseloads.",

The data simply breaks down the infection rates between different groups so that more effective and useful conclusions can be drawn . That's all. People are reading too much into this . In my opinion, the real clowns are the self-serving singaporeans who are suddenly so concerned about migrant workers rights, now that their health might be at risk due to the high infection rates among the latter . Its interesting to me that the very same people who made \"Bangla jokes\" and gross stereotypes are suddenly all for migrant worker rights when they jolly well knew all this time that migrant workers have always been subjected to lower standards of living and sanitary conditions . Where was this level of outrage when mediacorp cancelled subhas's work with the migrant worker band in light of the brown face scandal ? That song could have brought so much attention to the plight of migrant workers. But most Singaporeans didnt care because it didnt affect them but now that something affecting the migrant worker population can possibly threathen the livelihood of others everyone is a woke warrior.",
