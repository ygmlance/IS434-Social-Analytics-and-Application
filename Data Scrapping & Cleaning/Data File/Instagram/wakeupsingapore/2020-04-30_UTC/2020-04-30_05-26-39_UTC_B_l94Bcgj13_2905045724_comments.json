Clapping and singing is just a gesture showing appreciation for those frontline workers, like their effort didn't go unnoticed. If you are talking about the monetary support, for the less privileged there are #sgpaysitforward or giving.sg where people can donate. For the essential workers part, supermarket chain like shengshiong have given their staffs bonus salary this month. For frontline healthcare workers, the government had already given them extra bonuses even before the circuit breaker period, let alone say all the extra payouts from the budget payments. I'm pretty sure THAT can be exchanged for something to be placed on the table isn't it.  So stop spreading these useless and negative vibes and spread some positivities to help in this situation now. Btw, have you @wakeupsingapore donated or do your part since you always complained about poor living conditions of the foreign workers or are you just another NATO (no action talk only).",

What kind of meds will it cause extravasation. Does it have acute symptoms. Is it toxic. Do I have a line. Is that line patent. What about the patients vein. Is it fragile. Should I use a burette. Is the diluent right? Does it interact with the next iv meds imma give? How's the patients vitals?. And that's just one med. Most people come with minimum 10. And u have 9 patient  minimum now. U also have to spoon feed. Tube feed. Change diapers. Bathe patients. Ensure their skin isn't broken.(broken skin can lead to infection).

In terms of welfare its a touch and go but management tries. Not going to the toilet is pretty normal, even if we go we constantly worry about our assignments. It's not fake welfare its just that it hasn't come yet. Hopefully it comes. Im still pretty appreciative of Singapore healthcare irregardless as it is good but can be better but at the same time I can understand why certain things are the way they are. And tbh this post is just a joke. People need to chill. The claps and singing is appreciated but this post is still funny to me. I've had people telling me how to do my job countless times by people not trained medically. I've had relatives talked down to nurses as if we don't know how certain conditions are. That's my pet peeve. But patience is a prerequisite to this job. Really appreciative of your positive comment and recognition of the hardship any healthcare provider goes through.",

Well, while I agree with most part you have said, I can tell u a fact. After this whole incident, probably after a year or even longer, PAP will still be win their elections and nothing much will be change regarding the welfare of the nurses in Singapore. People always say 'Life is unfair' well, it is. I'm sorry for being blunt and it may hurt but look even communist countries like China can't make sure that everyone gets paid fairly. Foreign workers will work tirelessly day and night building our nation will earn 10 times lesser than an average banker sitting in an air conditioned room looking at different charts. This is life. This is Singapore society, in fact I think it will be the same around the globe. That's why parents are placing so much emphasis on their kids studies in hope that they become the top of the pyramid in future. Don't get me wrong, I do hope that the welfare of the nurses improve after this incident as well because I know now it's a tough period for them but I also know that in the end nothing much will be done and life will still go on as per normal, probably some improvements made to the foreign worker dormitories after this incident with a few contractors fired or sued along the way. If the words 'wait patiently' triggered u as well then I apologise at the wrong choice of words as well. But I also need to point out that I rather believe the news from the government than other unreliable news that will mislead you or result in you mislead others. I think you will agree with me on this.",
