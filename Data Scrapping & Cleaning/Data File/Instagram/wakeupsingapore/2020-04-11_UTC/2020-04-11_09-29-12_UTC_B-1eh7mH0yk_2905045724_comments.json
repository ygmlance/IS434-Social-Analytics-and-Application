The cost of a service is directly proportional to the income of the one providing the service. Especially at a time where the global economy is facing a fall worse than that of 2008. You can suggest government subsidies to cover up the increase cost of service,however,that would mean funds would not be able to be used for other relief programs. My point is,Increasing their salaries wouldn\u2019t be as rosy as it seems to be",

However,it was an issue in 2019,where people believe that ministers are paid too much and all,but in the end,the government did not do much. However,in light of Covid-19, Ministers had taken a month pay cut. So to answer you,yes yhe government officials have taken a hit and their pay most likely been redirected to relief efforts",
