Shouldn't China reacted properly to stop the virus before it got \"serious enough\"??? And wouldn't the other countries have properly vetted those with travel history if China was open about their virus problem? False sense of security? Do you know what causes a \"false sense of security\"? Claiming that the virus doesn't spread among humans, that it is controllable and preventable, then suddenly lockdown a whole city, then proceed to claim that the virus wasn't a global health emergency until too late, and then delaying announcing it is a pandemic.

The everyday boomers in China aren\u2019t the brightest in the world, convincing old folk is hard enough as it is. Yet China still managed to do that.

It is because of the infrastructure that the UK has planned for Hong Kong. The SAR Hong Kong is just living on with its colonial legacy.

The Chinese government refused to lockdown their country and wilfully let all of those potentially infected fly all around the world. And here you are, thinking that China was denying transaparency to stop the disease from spreading around the world. What a joke. And you think the Chinese people stupid or what? To stop mass panic? They knew the virus was a thing, that's why so many CCP officials fled overseas, sick people flew overseas taking as many fever pills as possible to fool the border vetting in Western countries. 5 million left Wuhan before the quarantine, as if they knew the quarantine was coming. And if you would like to talk about overseas people, the Chinese government are currently denying any foreign nationals from entering their own country. China ordered their border control along the Chinese-Russian border to shoot anyone attempting to enter China. So that's not a thing. China flat out don't give a damn about them. And they don't give a damn about the world either. Else China would have encouraged foreign countries from imposing travel restrictions to and from China instead of criticising them. Coz do you know what is most effective in stopping air travel? It's not fooling the people, it's cutting the flights.\ud83e\udd21",
