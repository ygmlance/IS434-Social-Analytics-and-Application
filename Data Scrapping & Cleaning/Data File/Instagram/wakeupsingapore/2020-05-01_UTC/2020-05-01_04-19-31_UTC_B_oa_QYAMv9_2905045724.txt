A public service ad on the Berkeley, California Daily Gazette (1918) during the height of the Spanish Flu. Residents who didn't wear masks outdoors were called "mask slackers" and fined $5 (S$120 in today's money). October 1918 was the deadliest month of the Spanish Flu pandemic, killing 195,000 people in America.
