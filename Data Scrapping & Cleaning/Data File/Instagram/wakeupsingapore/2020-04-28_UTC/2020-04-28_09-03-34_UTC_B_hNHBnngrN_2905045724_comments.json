So why not be alittle more sensitive about these posts that advocate for our foreign workers, who have hardly put a foot wrong in a country that they contributed to with their bare hands, some cranes and bulldozers? Why talk about starvation on \"the damn streets of Bombay India?\" Why talk about starvation and poverty in a post about how migrant workers should be more appreciated in Singapore?

But in anyway, I\u2019m just going to do this for the last time, because I don\u2019t have much time just for this either. There are more poor folks with slave mentality like you out there, than to focus on one. \nSo I have to assume that you didn\u2019t read and digest whatever that\u2019s written, judging from your reply. \n1) Nobody is focusing on drawing a comparison on Singaporeans and MWs. 2) And where they come from shouldn\u2019t justify the way we treat them. There\u2019s no need to compare at all. A lot of Singaporeans, unlike you, can judge that their living conditions NEED to be improved. \n3) And nobody is saying we are giving them the needs like an average Singaporean. Their condition is far away from that to take that as a comparison. Again here. You don\u2019t have to make unnecessary comparison. \n4) The government did not do its job to do proper auditing. They did not regulate the living conditions of the migrant workers. They did not make sure proper cleaning services are needed to keep a healthy environment for the workers. Just because companies are \u201cprivatised\u201d, it doesn\u2019t mean the government can\u2019t hold accountable. It is their job. And no, they did not enforce basic needs properly! Ask why they can\u2019t instead of  simply claiming they can\u2019t. Ask yourself, and look for the answers. \n5) And no, we\u2019re not a democratic society. We have a very SERIOUS issue on freedom of speech, not only that, the mainstream media is HEAVILY censored. That is exactly why Singaporeans can\u2019t think critically. Your world-view is indeed, very small. And I urge you to read more, learn more, DIGEST and stop fixating on how things is running as the only way. 6) And again, nobody is changing the social economic status. Nobody is talking about that! Do read and digest this entire comments section properly. I hope you learn a thing or two and that you\u2019ll read more in the future.",

Singapore has a shortage of labourers as a result of the majority of our society having proper education. So to mitigate the problem they need to outsource the labour jobs overseas, but the govt cant do that. Only contractors are able to do that which privatises overseas labourers. And private companies are always looking at profits so they do the bare minimum for such workers. This causes the govt to enforce basic needs for the workers. If the govt were to enforce the needs like average singaporeans it would cause the whole socioeconomic ladder in singapore to change. With the socioeconomic ladder changing it can lead to more unnecessary money being spent instead of spending on more essential actions. Being a democratic country, many singaporeans see having a good socioeconomic status is vital so the character of our society cannot change.",

This is simply not the case for a few reasons. Firstly, the Govt collects billions of dollars (all documented)in FW levy which can easily be used to improve their living conditions. Secondly, many employers have insane profits and so does construction projects like HDB etc. Why not cut their pie of the profits. Thirdly, you and I dont know the size of the reserves. But there are people who have, like Dr Yeoh Lam Keong (go check him out) who has said that we dont even need to raid our reserves, but a fraction of the return on investment of our reserves is more than enough to fund universal healthcare in Singapore.",
