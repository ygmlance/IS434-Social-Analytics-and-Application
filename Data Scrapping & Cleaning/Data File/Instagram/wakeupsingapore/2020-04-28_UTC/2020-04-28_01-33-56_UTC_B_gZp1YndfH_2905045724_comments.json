Imagine, you're saving lives yet you are stigmatized and not appreciated at all, and hat's just demoralizing:  https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/stigmatisation-of-frontline-health-workers-appalling-inquirer these sing along help support our frontlije workers emotionally and psychologically, don't you feel happy and encouraged when you're playing in a sport and everyone is rooting for you at the sidelines? But fin, here's one closer to home; https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-tan-tock-seng-staff-porters-housekeepers-12651204 our healthcare workers are facing the virus head on. Any decent humans would want to feel like they're efforts are not in vain, that people are behind them, cheering for them amidst the grim reality. One more and I hope you actually read the articles; https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-people-pen-well-wishes-for-healthcare-staff-amid-outbreak. As a matter of fact, I can't emphasize this enough: we are all humans. Being pessimistic and negative is the last thing any decent social creature would want in a time where social distancing is heavily implemented. These measures, even if it looks insignificant, may mean something to someone else's lives. At the very least, it helps Singaporeans feel united. It's not like we're living in a void that once the songs over, nothing is done. In fact, we have seen a rise in people giving donations, many on the ground movements and issues shed light upon to raise awareness, and all by the very Singaporeans living here. This is just another measure at our disposal. We have to take our chances, and if it means singing to unite and feel like there's no hope lost, sure. Stop being pessimistic unnecessarily.",
