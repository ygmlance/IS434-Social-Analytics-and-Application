The title is the first thing people see and react to - if it assumes the worst about your race or group you identify you, is it not xenophobic? And no, @charleslovespainting this is not \u201cmincing their words\u201d. There was a way to phrase this. The information presented would have been in no way diluted and distorted by having a BETTER HEADER. Secondly, the existence of such a header and article is a reflection of how ugly our society is because there is a need for such information to be cleared up. Demand creates supply basic econs. FACT: We are racist! And we need to do something about this entrenched racism instead of bickering about whether it exists: it does. Thirdly, come on guys can we please do better? Hello! Can wake up or not? Stop demonising a whole group of people. They are in a foreign country, far away from their families who they are probably worried sick for back home.

However, a natural and to-the-point conclusion will say whether B was really infected by A, such as the headline leaving the supporting fact in the main body. Fact is a fact, direct as is.

I did not advocate a more professional or sensitive title, the title introduces the main body, not the other way round. I did not deem who's right or who's wrong, I merely offer my perspective and pointed out some facts. Your replies tend to be tangential without trying to refute most of my arguments. It's clear you're here just to repeat your opinions because you and your friends are just upset by subjective experiences and thus being extra sensitive to things especially by taking them out of context.

ST were not the perpetuator of the speculation between fw and dw, instead, it acts as an impartial reporter of facts involving the speculation according to what happened and what it has gathered from its research without subjective inputs. With regards to your example \"17 Chinese people have covid-19, none have eaten any bats\", it would not be offensive if it is within the scope of the journalism and research. That is to say the context of the news article involves the objective reporting of the claim between the infected Chinese persons and their consumption of bats. However, if ST's research and report of that figure is nothing related to the consumption of bats such that they got from another person, but the 'none got it from bats' were an insinuation by ST as a form of subjective input, then it will be offensive because the news examines nothing about the relationship between the both. Tell me: how do you get upset over a fact? By thinking of another way to phrase the headline, you're mincing words as you find a less related synonym to replace the original word or distorting the information by excluding/inlcuding words. The existence of this header is a reflection of how ignorant and close-minded we are. Doing better to stop racism is not about avoiding the topic that may be sensitive and even more so, by announcing we are racist by default without any context or specific basis is racist in itself. It insinuates how they are of a lesser race and we are more superior so we are immediately racist. It speaks of how hypocritical you are - a social justice warrior who aims to correct a wrong at whoever disagrees with them so that you can validate your own ego. Instead, we should stop seeing the differences among us and have an open mind to integrate them as our own without judgement of their name, culture, custom or way of life.",

This stemmed from an interview with K Shanmugam, where a reporter (from Zaobao) asked the minister for his view on the suspicion that some people have - that foreign workers may have passed it on to maids. The minister said that the data does not support this conclusion at all and said that he will ask for the data (i.e. this figure of 17) to be released. Hence this headline is in fact a very to-the-point rebuttal to those who continue to insinuate that foreign workers may have passed it on to maids. It is should not be seen as trying to propagate the perception, but instead to precisely counter it head-on with factual data.",
