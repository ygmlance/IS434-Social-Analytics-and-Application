"Criticizing the government doesn't help, we need to be united in this period"
"If you see the new cases, almost all of them are foreign workers and not Singaporeans, so no need to worry, our government still managing this outbreak very well."

#sgunited doesn't mean blind support for the state. And framing foreign worker cases as a personal character failure is another attempt of using subliminal racism to absolve one's self for ignorance towards the plight of foreign workers all these years.
