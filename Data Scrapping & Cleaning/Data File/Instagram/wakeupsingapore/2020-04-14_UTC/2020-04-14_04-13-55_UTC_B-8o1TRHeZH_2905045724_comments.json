The 2nd type of Excuses: \u201cComparing to countries not doing well to justify excellence in your own Country\u201d \nSounds familiar? Because It\u2019s quite a common characteristic of the ruling party and some citizens. \nI think I do that sometimes too, due to influence.\n\nHowever, that is the last thing you should do, especially during a crisis.*** Because it helps almost nothing but create complacency. \nSometimes it\u2019s needed to create some peace and assurance. Even so, using it as a criticism against issues brought up and justifying them as complains and criticism, is unnecessary. \nJustifying excellence may be a good reminder and it encourages gratitude, but they do not serve well when being brought up against REAL issues raised by people. \nUnless the issues are not issues, but please then justify why they\u2019re not an issue instead of establishing \u201cexcuses\u201d. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be more well received by the critics as compared to \u201cexcuses\u201d. Criticism against system and management  is a form of surveillance on the authorities. Not all criticism are decent, but as a whole, they are a great power of surveillance towards authority and it is what we\u2019re lacking of. \nDo the right thing, use the \u201cexcellence justified\u201d to help others realise the need to give, whatever bits of excellence you attained from the excellent place you\u2019re living in.",
