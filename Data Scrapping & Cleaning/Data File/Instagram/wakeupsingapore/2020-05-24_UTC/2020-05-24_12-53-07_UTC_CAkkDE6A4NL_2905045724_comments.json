If your concern is that the infection will spread, and you trust ythe government enough then I'm sure you know that they would be denied entry into Singapore or at least heavily tested. So what's the point, we have our way of handling it, so do they, leave them be. If they die, then they die, if we die, then we die. The world is in a pandemic trying to solve this problem THE WAY THEY WOULD HANDLE IT, why impose onto them what we believe, this is this imposing and idealogy and I can almost dare to say that this is similar to trying to impose a religion onto another person, why bother, let them believe what they want and we believe what we want...

But however when it comes to free speech, i believe that it means the right to express information and ideas free from government regulation, even if it has no basis. I understand that even if the ideas that one may present have no basis or goes against the popular opinion. One should have the freedom to express it anyway without facing any legal repercussions. Hence the famous quote \"I don't agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it\" unless the ideas that they express are legitimate threats to inflict harm on someone. And yes, I do support the right for countries to rule separately as they see fit. But the human rights should be there as well. That is not the case for China. Because it's government is a oppressive communist regime. And although I appreciate the efforts taken to fix the conditions of the migrant workers, the fact that the conditions were u sanitary could have been easily prevented well before the start of the pandemic. The reason I called Singapore a laughing stock was because we were once the golden model for the world to follow during the start of the pandemic, but unfortunately we lost that status due to our complacency. And yes, I am fully aware of fake news and online falsehoods, but I certainly do not think that the government is the solution to fact check what is true or not, I think it lies purely on the individual to critically think for themselves whether or not it's fake. And yes. Some of the rules to protect us from the virus are necessary. But I personally draw the line, when enforces have to intrude in an individuals privacy to do so. And the only way we can prevent another contagion is to investigate the cause of it so that we can take preventative measures in the future",
