Don't make comparisons like oh Singapore have racism too. Like no shit, obviously every country has racism. Are we even denying racism in SG now? No right? Do we have a messed up leader like Trump who he himself committing crimes? Do we have police brutality here? Do we go around beating people up just because they are of a different race?? No right? So why you comparing????",

Wage slavery is a thing in capitalism even though slavery has been abolished.... Racism usually happens in capitalism because the noblemen Bourgeoisie creating a liberal capitalist society under classical/modern liberalism requires exploitation of a lower class, so racism is needed to discriminate against one race, so that exploitation and imperialism can be used to loot culture and goods and materials from the people being manipulated/imperialised..",

Or about north east to say that the Indians there are racist towards the Muslims/Malays? I feel that its inevitable to have racism everywhere. But i guess what my generation can do is to work closer to minimise the racism? The only reason why they are rioting and protesting its because there is a life and death scenario up there. Over here if a Chinese threatens any race its swiftly dealt by the law. Remember amy chong? She's chinese. Other than that. Micro-racism is inevitable and we can only keep it to the minimum",

Non-members are forced to live in plain igloos, are not allowed to buy many items and puffles and are not allowed to take part in most community events. Why is this? This is because Club Penguin penguins are segregated, just like the blacks in the 60's. America's segregation laws would prevent blacks from having many of the same privileges as whites, this creating an obvious divide between the two peoples. This caused the uprising of Martin Luther King Jr, the most famed black man in history, beat only by Kanye. Club Penguin, however, has no uprising. Why? Because it lacks freedom of speech. You step out of line, you're banished. Sent into a permanent exile, an outcast from the Club of Penguins. Any attempt to revolt against Club Penguin's oppression will result in an exile. So not only does Club Penguin enforce a caste system, but it is also a fascist state. Club Penguin is not a kids game- it is quite the opposite. It is a work of a dystopia that has managed to convince its subjects that it is fair. With deep political undertones and a disturbing portrayal of contemporary capitalism, this may be the best work of dystopian fiction since George Orwell's 1984.",

It is not to undermine the BLM movement nor even remotely suggest that minorities experiences here are the same. However, it\u2019s attempting to force people to face their own perceptions and behaviours in their own backyard in Singapore before they decide to try and fight for justice in a foreign country(to much less potential effect I might add). Not to take away attention from a truly horrible situation in the US, but this is also an opportunity to take a look at ourselves and reflect on our own situation locally, and the struggles minorities face here too that we may contribute negatively to with/without us being aware. With all these awareness posts flooding our grams about BLM, and not using racial slurs etc. Just before you click on that share button, perhaps it\u2019s worth a thought reflecting on your own behaviours towards minorities in Singapore, your own home country. That may be some change you could more effectively enact, other than that 1 click of a share button on an insta post. But unfortunately, performative activism seems to be ever so popular these days and I think that\u2019s what this post is trying to combat.",

You can be aware and still go about the day being racist. This is a deep-seated issue that sadly to say will not change anytime in the near future. So the next best way is to start with yourself and your family members, future generations. If we start from our own homes, in the future this may have a chance to get better for our future generations.

Before the video went viral, rmb, the police officers claimed that Floyd was having a medical misfortune and hence died due to natural illness. The video showed that the officer had his knee on his neck for almost 9 minutes and ignored Floyd's pleas to let him breathe. To those who said that violence is not the correct reaction, just try to put urself in their shoes where they always feel like they are victims of being racially profiled, possibly killed in the name of 'justice', and never able to feel free in the streets because the law enforcement themselves are racist in the core. This time they are so much more angry bcus there were evidences of the law enforcement covering up their own asses and normalizing the murder of a black guy. Sometimes being a little bit more empathetic can help you understand how much bottled anger they have. Stop comparing their racism to ours. We have racial prejudices between different races too, lets not pretend that its not there",

The thing thats fucked up about this entire racist issue in the first place is that the law enforcement that was supposed to take care of the people are choosing to weed out, instead, the minorities. Just try to sympathize w me now, ok? Jus imagine the fear of getting racially profiled because of the color of your skin. Imagine the fear of getting hit/framed for a crime u didn't commit because of the color of your skin. There are almost good evidences (check out Youtube yourself) of NYPD police officers fabricating evidence on the scene just to frame black people. And you claim that there are less black people getting killed than the officers, right? Let me tell you why your argument here is flawed: the police officers arent supposed to kill their civilians. Thought of looking at it from that light? How about this; how many black civilians were actually killed by the police? Do you think they actually keep track? Derek Chauvin almost got away with it. If not for the filming of this act, he would have gotten away with it. Simple as that. Now, police brutality is not something that happened yesterday. Imaginr being a member of a community that are constantly being racially profiled for the color of their skin, being constantly attacked by the very society that promised to protect them and having to fear for your lives, your friends' lives and your relatives' lives because of the color of your skin. Also, lets talk about another case that happened that morning of George Floyd's death, ok? Amy Cooper, a white lady, was also filmed for being a racist bitch. Jus go and read the article on it... i am lazy... the essence of this comment here, for those of u that deemed this tl;dr, well, just know that systemic racism doesnt appear overnight. Its is generations upon generations of racist prejudices, taught by other members of your community, taught by ur family members, etc. These actions might be subconscious sometimes",

However, I do not blame you or anyone else who does support the BLM movement because it is very easy to just see one side with the polarisation of media and poverty porn everywhere. It's not really fair to just say that they are currently being systematically oppressed. One thing I noticed a lot on the blm movement is that they want equality of outcome not equality of opportunity and that's a shitty thing to work towards.

You propose removing it because you see it as the initial catalyst for a lot of bad things that have been happening for a long time. But the reasons that racist mindsets persist isn\u2019t because we are classified into different boxes, but rather that we have been brainwashed by hateful rhetoric that drives hurtful ideas into our heads. An example would be the use of stereotypes. Teach a hateful race-based stereotype to a child enough times and they will believe that stereotype to be a true indicator of that race for a longass time to come. If we come together and dismantle and unlearn all hateful rhetorics, that\u2019s when we can truly move forward towards true progress as one united people. I Guess what I was pissed off at was that you just ceded defeat and didn\u2019t want to do anything. Idk what race you are, but for many brown folks here in SG, we don\u2019t have the privilege of just not caring... Hurtful stereotypes are acts of violence against my MOTHER. My FATHER.

Mind you that childrens at that age aren't aware of how hurtful words can be that's why parents should play their part and teach them what is right and what is wrong. By the time everyone graduates from Primary school, they'll learn that racist insults isn't about racism but just another stupid insult that should only be used in a non serious conversation, like friendly insulting.

You can ask any minority right now to list out all the racist comments they've received their entire life and they can list them all out without hesitation and laugh it off. Honestly if you're still making racist insults after 20 years old then that's just called immature, not racist.
