Before the video went viral, rmb, the police officers claimed that Floyd was having a medical misfortune and hence died due to natural illness. The video showed that the officer had his knee on his neck for almost 9 minutes and ignored Floyd's pleas to let him breathe. To those who said that violence is not the correct reaction, just try to put urself in their shoes where they always feel like they are victims of being racially profiled, possibly killed in the name of 'justice', and never able to feel free in the streets because the law enforcement themselves are racist in the core. This time they are so much more angry bcus there were evidences of the law enforcement covering up their own asses and normalizing the murder of a black guy. Sometimes being a little bit more empathetic can help you understand how much bottled anger they have. Stop comparing their racism to ours. We have racial prejudices between different races too, lets not pretend that its not there",

Unfortunately every stance on this matter you put out, due to the overwhelming number of personal opinions that have been displayed by many individuals, ends up either on the side of the oppressor, or the oppressed. I didn\u2019t even start out to be against the OP, I was baiting him to show what his actual stance was and he got upset instead of doing it. I don\u2019t think there was anything wrong with my first comment. Also, I did not say he is not supportive of BLM. Look up detracting and you\u2019d understand. I didn\u2019t go into facts and bother proving OP wrong because I didn\u2019t find it worth my time, he just sounded like another closed minded old man on the internet waiting to be made fun of",

Please consider that this is a complicated matter and that the looting is not merely FOR George Floyd nor that material possessions are the reason for the looting. Perhaps not all of them, but these people are in PROTEST. and there is NO RIGHT WAY to protest.\n\nIn this case, I can see why you might have such a thought cross your mind. But just because something doesn't make sense or sit right with you, means it is wrong. Instead, you should ALWAYS research and find out more BEFORE forming (and ESPECIALLY SHARING) your opinions. In this case, perhaps I should remind yout that the media is something everyone should be extremely precautious about - I'm sure we all learnt that daily. \nOn this note, I really also want you to reflect that perhaps your comment stems from a place of racism. Just perhaps.\n\nMy intention for calling you out is NOT to label/judge/one-up you - I just think that it is very dangerous (and honestly very embarrassing) for you to continue exercising such a pattern of thoughts and actions.\n\nI hope you will take this message positively and move on from this to actively educate yourself and others (respectfully, please!) when in conversation/discussion about #blacklivesmatter and ANY topic of social injustice you encounter in your future for that matter. //Cheers. //- your fellow Singaporean Gen Z (@xxr_29 hey feel free to DM if you would like to continue this convo privately)",

Thirdly, you made yourself look like the ignorant fool by suggesting that i should pick up a history book because historically peaceful demonstrations have not worked. Right back at you, MLK led the civil rights movement which leads to The Civil Right Act of 1964, which ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex and or national origin, is considered one of the crowning legislative achievements of the civil rights movement.

                "text": "@sleuth_zw I haven\u2019t been reading super extensively on the situation, but from what I\u2019ve read, the riots in US are not only to raise the degree of his charge, but also to push for a reform of the police system in US. Before George Floyd there were a lot of cases of police brutality surfacing, and in the past month or so at least 3 major cases (George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor) or even more where they\u2019ve been killed unnecessarily. The fact that policemen that killed them get off practically scot free, or (in Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s case) the police only arrested the shooters after months is the reason why they are protesting. The main reason Derek Chauvin was prosecuted so quickly was because of how the story blew up online and everyone pushed for a charge.  The fact that people have been protesting for change since 2013 and have made barely any progress in legislation doesn\u2019t help, and many of them are angry because of that. George Floyd\u2019s case was merely the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.",
