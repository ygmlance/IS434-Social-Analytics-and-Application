As for panic buying, we could have calmed people down by suggesting for them to not believe all the lies being spread on Whatsapp for example. My point is we Singaporeans played a part in the worsening of the pandemic and thus, really, as much as our frustrations call for us to blame the govt, we've really gotta sit back and rethink if it were really fair for us to find faults in the govt's actions but ignore our own.",
