That's why now everyone is racing to slim down and be healthy as to avoid the worst brunt of the virus if and when they contract it, and have the highest chance to survive, or better still, just show very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.",

Even day time,couple holding hands,families having picnics and people fishing. There are simply not enough officers to maintain social distancing. People are abusing the leeway the government has given and if the situation doesn\u2019t improve,i won\u2019t be surprised if the government removes this privilege too",
