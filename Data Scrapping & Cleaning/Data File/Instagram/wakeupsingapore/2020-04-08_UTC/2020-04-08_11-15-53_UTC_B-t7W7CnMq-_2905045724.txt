Nobody Asked Episode 15: LET’S RAISE $100K TO HELP MIGRANT WORKERS IN SG!?!?!?!? DONATE HERE: give.asia/donatepls

tried to break down everything that’s happening in the news with migrant workers in Singapore, but ended up with more questions than answers...but one thing's for sure, they need our help.

So let’s try to raise 100k for HealthServe and Transient Workers Count Too - TWC2, organisations who directly address the immediate needs of migrant workers here.

Shoutout to our migrant friend who agreed to be interviewed for this episode, and to the team behind this video @utopia.sg, @preetiplsintern. -
