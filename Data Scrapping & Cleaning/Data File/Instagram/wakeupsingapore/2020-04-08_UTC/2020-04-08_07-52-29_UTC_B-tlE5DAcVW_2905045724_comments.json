The food provided to these workers are free of charge. We must also look at the number of sgreans serving SHN vs the number of foreign workers in the dorms. I'm no expert on the numbers, but I can assure you that there are many more foreign workers. Furthermore, these foreign workers, while they do contribute massively to our development and economy, are not Singaporeans loyal to the state. It may sound petty, but I don't think any country in the world would treat others better than their own people. I've seen many sgreans complain a lot during these trying times and I might dare say that if the food of the foreign workers was better than that of the SGreans serving SHN, people would be complaining \"why foreign workers get better food than sg people?\" Lastly, it could very well be the employers of these foreign workers providing the food for the workers. Not everything has to do with the gov, who alr have their hands full with controlling the covid-19 situation, dealing with some irresponsible people who refuse to adhere to the guidelines and keeping the general public calm. It's not easy and I feel we should be more appreciative than nitpick on every small thing that they do. In the end, we should definitely be wanting better for everyone, but there is nothing gained in pointing fingers, but instead, we should stay strong, cooperative and united at this time.",

Foreign Workers are still human beings, to work in a country not of their own to be build all of your MRT,HDB basically every infrastructure that makes Singapore WHAT & in fact, all that it is. \nYou\u2019re bullshitting your only excuse is that Singapore is too small or that they are already getting more than they deserve.\n\nEverything around us is built by who? You guessed it, foreign workers & many more people. \nLiterally you\u2019re living in a home built by hard work of many men who tire themselves every single day. To provide a humane accommodation is not asking for gold. They may not be Singaporeans but their labour work deserves more than what it gets credit for.  You may be under the impression that they are asking for it but seriously? These people HAVE NEVER COMPLAINED. THEY DEAL WITH THIS CRAP. \nTHEY TAKE IT ALL IN and continue living despite the challenges because that\u2019s how you survive. And you compare that to people, our Singaporean\u2019s complaining about minor inconvenience? Y\u2019all don\u2019t understand how bloody annoying it is. \nSome of you don\u2019t understand how difficult this is. You really don\u2019t. In technchnicality there\u2019s a lot of unjust and imbalance and YES we do more for our foreign workers than other countries treat their own but you have to realise. It\u2019s difficult to convert empathy to actual change but please widen your perspective. \nThings are always difficult to change but please don\u2019t even TRY to say that\u2019s what they are deserving of. Bringing light to this problem is one thing, but literally nothing is being done. \nSo now my question is, how bad does the situation have to get for the people in power to realise there\u2019s a problem?",

There will be some freak cases but in general I still feel that most firms would do their best to comply with MOM standards. The food looks unappetising sure, but that doesn't mean it's inedible or not nutritious. Also, the quote may be biased as well, as they may say such things to influence opinion and put pressure on the employers to provide more expensive food. If the money for more expensive food comes from the government, then that means less reserves for us in general. If it's from the employers' own pockets, then it will raise the prices of housing as I've mentioned in previous replies above.

To say that \"FW are all we care about\" is pretty inaccurate \u2014 this is just one of the ways which we can be better during this coronavirus period. To say we want the government to \"babysit\" them to live a life of \"affluence\" is also inaccurate and missing the point of this post \u2014 we just want that for the limited period of this coronavirus quarantine their food is just regular, standard, not-rotten meat, vegetables and rice.

And just so uk im pretty sure the govt has done a lot to help our many low income families and people in need. If u think the govt shldnt be helping them bcus it 'disrupting society' then shldnt all those relief funds that r given out my the govt redundant and disrupting economy as well? Doesn't mean u come from a family that's not well to do then u have to dump all the hate on those innocent workers. Maybe u need to reflect on why u couldnt make more money on ur own without the help of the govt?",

The employers are the one that see this conditions on a daily, and are CONTENT with it as long as their pockets are thick. How do THEY LIVE with themselves at all? I am only aware of these type of conditions because I used to work with our foreign workers and they would share with me these atrocities. However despite being a Singaporean, I couldn't do much. These organisations go beyond what we can control. It's not something we can fix with a switch. And telling the necessary channels didn't get me anywhere either. Believe me, the blaming game means nothing in the wide scale of things. Why shame People that receive good food, instead of just being angry about how our foreign works are being treated poorly? We should work to improve lives, but not shame others especially when they aren't in a loop of the situation",

Naturally, it has to focus its attention towards its citizens with better welfare in order to garner more votes. Thats also one of the negative effects of democracy. 2. Citizens makes up the majority of all nations in the world. With only that much resources, and only 1 government, its not possible to please everyone since everyone has different needs and wants. Therefore, only majority can possibly be satisfied. So welfare is focused on its citizens. If all is divided equally regardless of your title of citizen or not, the concept of true equality among all in itself is going towards communism and no longer democracy.

Of course if I asked you if you wanted free food, and all you got was a disgusting ration, you'd buy your own food instead. But earning 15$ a day, I think you would take the disgusting food that no one with a choice would eat. And again, loyalty to the state has nothing to do with quality of food. Not all Singaporeans are loyal to the state. And not all foreign workers are entirely disloyal to it. When two people are in the same situation of requring food, that is the only condition they should fulfil: being human. You shouldn't give more or less or better or worse food to one or the other for any reason. Loyalty to the state just doesn't fit in at all into the quality of food.

So I guess we shouldn\u2019t really complain when our own Singaporeans who are working or studying abroad get the same treatment as what our foreign workers are being treated now, since you know they are not \u2018loyal to the state\u2019? I get it, you are grateful for them and that\u2019s great, but like you said this is reality and guess what, we are all human beings, regardless of anything... Btw, the people who are serving their SHM in the hotels, are getting food for free as well. So basically, no matter where you are serving your SHM, in a dormitory, in a 5 Star hotel or whatever, we have to treat everyone equally... especially those who needs it most. They are getting food free of charge so the quality should be the same? No? And we shouldn\u2019t just depend on the government.. we can obviously for one, raise awareness as you can see that\u2019s being done, so next we should all just work tgt and like help in any way we can. There are some organisation that help people in need. And for those who keep saying that we can\u2019t do anything well that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Just by this photo many people are being aware. Many people are helping out. And if you see the recent news, some of the food are getting better, but only some. So don\u2019t stop guys.

And I am aware that they are completely different circumstances. However, I have heard of cases where the workers just get rice and plain curry drizzled over it. No veggie, no meat. Furthermore, to simply have a diet that mostly compromises of carbohydrates is not sustainable for anyone regards of their jobscope. Meals should be more balance because humans need a certain amount of nutrients not found in rice, but veggies and meat in order for us to be healthy. Just take a look at the food pyramid. In the long term, if humans lack certain nutrients, it can cause irreversible health problems, like the lack of iron can cause anemia, or if carbohydrate intake is too high, it can lead to diabetes. I also know that a lot of people are not aware that the food are delivered so early that the food go bad, that's why I'm trying to bring more awareness to this issue.",
