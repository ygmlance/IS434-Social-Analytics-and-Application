Also, the problem is not with Singaporeans wanting \"low cost\" because that's not the case at all in the current housing market. If you took basic econs you should know that it's only natural for consumers to demand for lower prices, nothing shocking here, it applies to everywhere around the world too. The theory of utility basically. Our housing prices are already high enough as it is and we don't want it higher, sorry to say but we're not gonna ruin the housing market further to suit your need for moral satisfaction. Also, what do you mean by \"government funding is not government's money\"? It is part of government's reserves which they desperately need to tap upon to solve urgent matters during the CB period like increased retrenchments among locals and dying SMEs in Singapore. Just because you and your forefathers gave taxes doesn't mean you have the right to dictate where these tax revenue goes, because the government has more urgent and pressing problems to use these revenue on. Lastly, I never said human lives are less important than money, but it's simply not practical to implement the solutions you propose. And before you argue with me further, there have already been economists who have analysed the social costs and benefits that these decisions brought about, and have come to the conclusion that the status quo is the best option. So you can rant here all you want but the government and firms are not going to change their decisions for you.",

Temperature screening should have been started as early as JAN. Our Politicians shouldn\u2019t have went down and ask them to \u201csocial distance\u201d in the dorms when the conditions are way overcrowded. Same for the segmented transport vehicle above, it makes no sense to have such a vehicle like that when they\u2019re overcrowded one they reach the dorms. That\u2019s just denial on our part. If dorm Operators cannot cough up the money, then the Govt can use our money to do so. These workers are technically OUR employees. It beats being in denial about the situation. Finally, if it\u2019s too troublesome, then perhaps all construction can be HALTED for the time being till the curve flattens. Unless of course, we want to send a message that we value our concrete structures more than human lives. (:",
