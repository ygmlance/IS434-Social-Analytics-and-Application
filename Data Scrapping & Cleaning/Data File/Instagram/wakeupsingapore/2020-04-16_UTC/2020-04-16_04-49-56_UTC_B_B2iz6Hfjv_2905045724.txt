In Australia and NZ, MPs and Ministers who breached safe distancing measures resigned and at least one was demoted. If a migrant worker did the same thing, his work permit will be revoked. What will happen to the likes of Chia Shi-Lu 谢世儒 and co in Singapore?

Before we forget the standard expected of our leaders, let's refresh our memory with these two quotes from our honourable ministers... "In Japan, the CEO and board of directors will call a press conference and take a deep bow, and in the good old days, they may even commit hara-kiri. Where there are breaches of the Companies Act, both the company as well as the individuals responsible will be charged, and if found guilty, punished with fines and/or jail terms for the individuals." - Minister Khaw Boon Wan "All of us will make mistakes. When a mistake is made, just come clean and say so, but don’t cover up. That’s why I have not let this go, because it is not about cleanliness of the ceiling, it is about clean politics, and I appeal to you because I know you to be an honourable man." - Minister Vivian Balakrishnan
