Ethnic minorities are over-criminalised and over-represented in statistics due to the criminal justice system acting on these racial stereotypes. - \nAccording to Phillips and Bowling (2012), the oppressive policing and the practise of stop-and-search allows police to arrest individuals of interests with no reasonable suspicion, causing ethnic minority to be \u201coverpoliced\u201d as well as \u201cunder-protected\u201d. - \nThe MacPherson Report (1999) has also exemplified how prevalent police racism can be, as the inquiry into the wrongful murder of Stephen Lawrence concluded that there was institutional racism and corruption in the Metropolitan Police with officers holding deeply ingrained racist attitudes. His death was held to be marred by a combination of \u201cprofessional incompetence, institutional racism, and a failure of leadership by senior officers\u201d. Sociologist Holdoway also shows how negative stereotypes are repeatedly endorsed through the police Canteen Culture, where police create racist banter to cement solidarity. \u2022 Phillips and Bowling (2012) found that the CPS was more likely to drop cases against ethnic minorities due to weaker evidence presented to them by the police and based on the stereotyping of ethnic minorities as \u201ccriminals\u201d. - Similarly, Hudson and Bramhall (2015) argue that pre-sentence reports for ethnic minorities were harshly written by probation officers and allow for unwitting discrimination. \u2022 According to the ministry of justice, members of the black community are 7 times more likely to be stopped and searched, 3 and a half times more likely to be arrested and 5 times more likely to be imprisoned. \u2022 victim surveys have also found black people to be overwhelmingly overrepresented among those identified by victims as offenders",

With that said, there is no evidence present to prove that the motivation for the incident was due to racism. You fail to provide any key evidence but rather just let your emotions run wild. I understand that this is a sensitive topic, but if we look at the statistics, racist cops are not as prevelant as you think.\nTo call me a racist is just honestly fucking stupid. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE ACTIONS OF THE COPS. The cops committed murder and i acknowledge that. I think they derserve to be jailed and charged with murder, no doubt about that. How is that racist? Cite me the evidence where i show that one race is superior than the other. \nTo call the police a fascist and a racist really shows how ur immature brain thinks. Again, i do not agree with the actions of the officer. However, there is not enough evidence at this stage to claim that he is a racist, and you still call him a facist? Really? I really cannot believe that you, an undergrad, just went on putting tags on people without any concrete evidence.\nRegrding the rights of the blacks being stripped from them, what rights are being removed?

Police brutality in the US has always been targeted towards the black community, and America has perennially sustained itself through a regime built on White Supremacy and Black Oppression. \nRacist policing is extremely rampant and prevalent with the police, due to myths of black criminality and harmful stereotypes pinned against the black community which eventually predisposed them to a higher likelihood of being incriminated and murdered than their White counterparts. \nTo argue that the incident does not reek of racism speaks volumes of your IGNORANCE and imbecility. \nGeorge Floyd died a wrongful death. He did not and never resisted against the authority, yet he was brutally assassinated. \nAnd for the record, yes your opinion is extremely uneducated and unpopular - and also racist. \nIt shocks me that people like you fail to recognise how racism is weaved into our Everyday lives. \nYou don\u2019t get to dictate what is \u201cracism\u201d to you when you\u2019re not part of the demographic that has been hit. \nEducate yourself before spouting uncorroborated facts.",

If the cops were truly racist, there would not have been a need for her to act as if the black person was assaulting her, which is definately wrong and against the law. My point with the Amy Cooper incident is that the police wouldnt blindly side with anyone. The only one that was being racist and that i dont support is Amy Cooper. Would the police focus their investigations more on Christian? We wouldnt know, there is not enough evidence to suggest that. Would the cops have shot Christian? Possibly, but it would turn out to be unjustified. Therefore, i still do not believe the cops are racist here, but rather is just Amy Cooper trying her luck to trick the police to help her case, which ultimately failed.",

No of course not, but again, im saying that we dont know whether he is racist and the actions against george floyd had racist intent. Even if he was racist, i doesnt automatically mean that the entire police force is racist. My point that im trying to get across is that currently, we do not have enough evidence to show that the killing of George Floyd had something to do with racism just because its a white cop and a black suspect.

U might say that the police may not have been racist, but perhaps think about why then the police officer in this case would take such an action, that we all agree is inhumane, on this person? Especially when he was already in handcuffs? And would the outcome  be different if it was not a Black person but  someone else of a different group of people in society?",

                "text": "@183828382_aaa I agree with u that America is not a racist place whereby many people don't condone racism. However, this incident in the larger context of police brutality that Black Americans have faced, shows how the judicial system tolerate and grants some racist police officers the power to inflict injustice on Black Americans (with little repurcussions). This case of Floyd blew up because he died. However, there are many instances where Black Americans have been threatened at gun point for trivial misunderstanding, or been treated unfairly or arrested by the police for doing everyday things that others are doing as well. Perhaps you can do more research on other cases of Black Americans facing injustice from the police, and put this incident in the bigger context of things. My point is, the judicial system in America has perpetuated racism amongst police officers that are racist. Eg. On the case of Amy Cooper, she knew that she could call the police on a Black person and falsely accuse him because she knows that the police are more likely to side with her and focus their investigation more on Christian Cooper than on the reliability of her claims. Which could cause Christian Cooper to be arrested without reason, have his integrity as a person questioned and lose his dignity in some way. She knew she could use the police as a weapon and why? Because the police have established themselves as an unfair law enforcement that will side with the White than POCs because of who? Racist police officers.",

For the George Floyd case, Im neither saying or denying that this case is due to a racist cop, the evidence to support that statement it just no sufficient currently. If racist intent was present, then sure i agree he should be punished but the problem i see now is that people are just assumming its a racial issue just because its a white cop and a black men",

The video itself was very vague on whether the cop acted because he was racist. By no means am i defending the cop's actions of restraining him in that manner, but other than that putting the blame on racism is just pure speculation until the investigations are done",
