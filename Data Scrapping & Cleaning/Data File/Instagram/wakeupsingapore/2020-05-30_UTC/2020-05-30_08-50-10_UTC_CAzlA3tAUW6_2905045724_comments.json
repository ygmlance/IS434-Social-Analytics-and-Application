In fact this is a sentiment that isn\u2019t just advocated by her. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr was a staunch advocate of peaceful protesting. He stated, \u201cDarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\u201d There\u2019s a reason MLK is universally recognised as the single greatest human rights leader ever, because he knew that to get a message across to those who have wronged you, you cannot use hate, your actions cannot be fuelled by anger and most importantly you cannot stoop to the same level as your oppressors. Anger and outrage are justified emotions when a hate crime takes place. But manifesting those emotions by violent protests won\u2019t get your voice heard, it\u2019ll get you thrown in jail, like it has in Atlanta and New York right now.",

I have many friends in America, even one living one street down from where George Floyd was murdered who all agree that understand that this is the course of action that must occur in order to incarcerate Chauvin and obtain justice. Who told you the firm has to detain chauvin? Didn\u2019t you know all 4 police officers merely were fired to protect the precinct and were paid administrative leave?",
