The similarities between these two protests are just so shocking and people (esp ones who live in such safety zone) should really rethink the struggles behind protests. Protestors sure know for what they might lose or face, but have you ever thought what pushed them to risk it all? There is no right way to protest because that\u2019s what protests are. And for those who say the hk police are \u201cjust doing their jobs\u201d, im just too sick to ask u to read more international news but hoping police brutality won\u2019t happen to your friends, family or yourself.",
