What do you mean by \"people should not treat lockdown as a fool proof way to conceal the virus\"? First, its not a lockdown. Second, conceal the virus? What do you mean? You meant eradicating the virus within Singapore? There wont be a gray area in anything. If there was, people will be taking advantage of it. You think the youth of today's time can hold on at home for a month or so? Many like the elderly wants to go out and socialise but we cant allow it because the virus have to be stopped. No exceptions. Im not sure if old folks homes are still open but if they are then they can get their entertainment there. But i think its most likely closed due to clusters forming and elderly being the most vulnerable to it. If they want entertainment, they can go to their kid's house. Only if they have good relationship. There aint no other options. Cooperate.",
