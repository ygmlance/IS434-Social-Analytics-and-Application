But anw I just wanna give my thoughts on the subject and the administrator's comments. Firstly, I don't feel that what the dorm operators did was necessarily wrong. Their objective is to curb the spread, and much like how people who return from overseas have to serve SHN (legal confinement), the dorm operators confined the workers in order to limit their movements and stop the spread. However, I feel that their approach towards it is wrong. Since they do not have the rights to confine the workers, they should've contacted the authorities in order to list them down as contactees for contact tracing / quarantine the workers legally? (idk how that works). FURTHERMORE, I feel that it is inaccurate to say that all they got is a \"stern warning\" as police investigations are on going... Would you rather the dorm operators be wrongfully punished?... So yes, for now they've only received a stern warning. However, that may change as the police concludes their investigations. MOREOVER, the dorm operators confined the workers for 1 day. Before shifting them into a warehouse w toilet access. And I'm assuming this warehouse where they're held at is legal as MOM and CNA didn't report anything illegal about that, maybe it wasn't locked from the outside or something. So, maybe them keeping the workers in that room is probably just to hold them, until they prepped the warehouse or something. I really don't know. HOWEVER, I just wna say that although what many of the dorm operators have done are wrong and much of this wrongdoings have come to light recently, I feel that it is also unjust for you to make those kinds of statements against them and MOM. Well, anyways I urge my fellow Singaporeans to read the articles and not just the titles before jumping into conclusions. Thanks for reading if u read this far.",

And yes, my opinion is that it is too fast to jump to conclusions and for those that have only read the administrators comments, isnt it skewing their perception, as they do not know any better? I am attacking his opinion, because he justified it using misleading information and presented it to the public... And how is that right? And so u see a 'rape victim' in a hse, means that the hse owner rape the victim? Not looking at the evidence of whose dna is on the victim? Or maybe cuz the 'victim killed the owners mum and ate his dog' and when the owner came back he injured her and locked her in the basement? Right... investigation in ongoing... And yes, they got permission by the worker employers... What was the argument. You pasted an excerpt and no argument... So there was nothing to reply... And yeaa u didn't have to copy n paste it lol... N again yahh, personal atk.. Still don't understand what you're trying to do here... You are talking to an anonymous down syndrome giraffe for god sake... Idgaf... You don't know me and I'd rather not know someone like you...",

LOL. if you are so easily influenced by other people's opinions then you technically don't have your own. aren't you trying to influence somebody else's opinion as well? you're right, emotions should not interfere with logic. but as decent humans should we not have empathy? if a victim was found raped and locked in the basement, would your first instinct be to go to high court and say \"no eviDenCe cAnnOt conDemn kidNapPer\"? furthermore, you have not answered to the following part of my argument. did you not read the excerpt? i even copied and pasted for you man. \ud83d\ude29 but ok. ig i'm such an insolent brat. hence, to conclude my statement, i would like to quote the famous wise philosopher, Nicki Minaj. \"eat a Barbie ass or sumthin.\"",

                "text": "@prophetsheryl Hi, so yea. Your points are well thought. But you've missed the point of my argument. My stand is that I felt that the actions taken were wrong, but the dorm ops may not be entirely wrong, because the police are still investigating into the matter. So, without perfect information about the entire situation, I am unable to conclude if they are right / wrong and the extent of which it is so. \nThe administrators point of view was that MOM was too lenient on the dorm ops and the dorm ops were wrong. Which I felt was unjust because the information was inaccurate. A 'stern warning' isn't what all they've got. It is all they've gotten 'for now'. Like I said, still under investigation. What would you want MOM to do, when they havnt got the full picture? He / she has drawn a conclusion based on inaccurate information and is skewing public perception. Which I felt was unjust. \nMy point on justifying the dorm ops actions was to clarify the situation as well as give a different perspective on what MAY have happened. Whether you believe it's right or wrong, it's your opinions and I rly couldn't care less.\nThe point on intentions doesn't justify actions. Is wrong. Intentions do justify actions. That is the difference between an accident, an act of self-defence, man slaughter and murder. Whether or not the dorm ops intentions were right or wrong, depends on the evidence and the judge. In my opinion, I felt that their intentions MAY be right. However, we can agree to disagree. There is not enough information for a conclusion anw. \nYour whole argument on me adoring the govt and bla bla bla was out of point. So non-contender.\nYour whole appeal to emotion statement also... Yahh I do agree, it rly sucks for them, especially right now. But what does that have to do with the argument here?... I'm not saying that it is not sad / painful for most of them. I'm saying that we don't have the full story, so why are u spreading inaccurate info and your own conclusions...\nAnd also, oof personal attack right there. So... Yea sorry err IDGAF. This says alot more abt your maturity than anyth rly...",

This would potentially lead to a leak and more clusters. Tbh I don\u2019t think the idea behind this is necessarily wrong either, the approach may be but the idea was not. You are speaking up for them yes sure but did u consider perhaps they were sneaking out? Would u have the same argument if they had indeed caused a huge eruption in the community? Or is your opinion based off a blinded need to stand up for \u201chuman rights??\u201d. If so then direct your energy to fight the real issue in China/India where people are being oppressed by their own people. They are the ones that truly have no voices.

It\u2019s one thing to spit in the hand of someone who\u2019s trying to pick you off the ground. But it\u2019s another, when you take that person\u2019s hand, let him stand you up, then look him in the eye and spit in his face, saying that he was wrong. This page has a presence and the power to influence. Yet they choose to try and turn people against the government when they\u2019ve been trying to help. And honestly, the government has given us advice to stay home yet people still wanna go out, and end up getting infected. And somehow that\u2019s their fault?
