imagine being so self-centered you waste the resources of the government, the efforts of the healthcare workers, essential workers, the potential health of the vulnerable people you put at risk just so you can go have some fun.

Paramedics, nurses, doctors are working overtime to keep the situation under control. If you do get infected from your night of fun, you are taking up one more bed that people have to look after, time and attention away from others who may really need it. Lives are at stake. The government pays for your treatment, which means all of us are paying for it. This affects more than just your selfish ass.
