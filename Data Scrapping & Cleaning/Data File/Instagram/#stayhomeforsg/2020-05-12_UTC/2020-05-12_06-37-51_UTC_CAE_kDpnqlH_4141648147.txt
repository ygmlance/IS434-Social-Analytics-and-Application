I completed the #circuitbreaker400 challenge last week. I am Glad i came out of it injury free but a slight sore on the metatarsal near the pinkie toe.

I’ve been asked these too often. Why do I run so much? Why do you like running? How do you keep yourself entertained during your time running? And many other questions.

This is the perfect opportunity to answer some of these questions. ‘Why do I run so much?’ Firstly i do not believe in “junk miles”. Every mile, every step taken during your training is beneficial to your cardiovascular performance. Your heart is a muscle that needs to be developed. Capillaries are enhanced and increase in quantities as you put in the miles. These runs are slow and in aerobic zones. A simple test its the ‘talk test’, run at a pace where you can carry a conversation with your running companion. In time, you will notice this will build the foundation of your running fitness. It will also prove to be resilient against downtime, when you dont run as much as you would like. ‘Why do I like running?’
Running is my therapy. The science says that running or any exercise for the matter release endorphins, the feel good hormones. Everyone wents to feel good right?! It is also a stress reliever for me. “Run your troubles and the day’s worries away.” I always tell myself. I run when I’m stress, i run when I’m tired (to get a boost). I run when i want a shot of endorphins. I want because i enjoy it. “Love what you do and it is no longer a chore.
