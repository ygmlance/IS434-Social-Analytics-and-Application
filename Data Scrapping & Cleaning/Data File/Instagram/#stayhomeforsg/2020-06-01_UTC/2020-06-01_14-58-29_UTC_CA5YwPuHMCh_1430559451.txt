It is Day 56. 🙌

My government has decided we will exit the potential political hot potato that is its Circuit Breaker at 1159 hours, 1 June 2020. Well, the significant decline in new community cases is gladdening indeed. While I am well-adjusted to #stayhome and CB remains a blessing (hold onto your tomatoes), I am no 'remainer'; I will embark on my 3-phase approach responsibly.

PHASE 1 AKA SAVE RE-OPENING

Save Time:
Transition from IG posts to stories

Save Money:
Resume job search

Save Our Earth:
Use even less 💦 and 🔌

As Always:
Pack meals using reusable containers daily
Catalogue items to sell/let go for charity
Eschew public transport—🚴‍♂️ instead

LIFTED:
Self-imposed 'ban' on coffee and tea
Self-imposed limit on movement (only TPY)

Everyone, see you again on 1 June 2021! 👋
