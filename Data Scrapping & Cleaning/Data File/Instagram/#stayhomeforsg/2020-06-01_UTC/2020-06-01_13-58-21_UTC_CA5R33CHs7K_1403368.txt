1 June 2020. Being Grateful.

To be able to see this candy-coloured sunset today. This was taken after a rainy stormy day. Remember storms don't last forever. At the end, the light will shine through and make a beauty out of that storm. Will this mark the start of something beautiful?

Love this quote from Martin Luther King, Jr.: Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.

The first half of this year has been especially difficult and filled with anxiety. Everything is put to a pause.

Disruption was the word.

We were forced to stay at home, quarantine and confinement became a norm, technologies were embraced, organisations said hello to remote work (aka work from home), home-based learning became a new trend for education (unschooling anyone?), stepping out of the house requires a mask, and physical distancing becomes a part of life.

What used to be a norm was no longer a norm, at least for the past few months.

You know what people always say about trials and tribulations? Trials let us see what we are made of. It is when you've been through shit that you realised the many wonderful things and people that are still surrounding you. You may not have everything, and thats ok because you don't need everything. You just need the essential ones. “Trials teach us what we are; they dig up the soil, and let us see what we are made of.” – Charles Spurgeon

May we move on to a better tomorrow. Leave the hatred, rid the racism, put aside the prejudice, be a better person and fill the world with love.
