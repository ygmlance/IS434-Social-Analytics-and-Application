Singapore 'Circuit Breaker' Day 56, and it the finale of 'Singapore 'Circuit Breaker' , but although we were not quite there yet,as to lift up all tighter measures.
But will be opening up gradually in phases, as not to invite a sudden surge of cases, we have to be very cautious and mindful as this pandemic was still hiding in the dark before a vaccine is found.
Have Penne Pasta with button mushrooms in tomatoes sauce for lunch.  I always like to have lots of cheesze, ground red pepper and spring onions to mixed it in which it seems like some salad.🍽🍴🍝🧀🧅🍄🌶🥫
