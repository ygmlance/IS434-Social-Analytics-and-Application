👗 All dressed up, but nowhere to go 🤷🏻‍♀️⠀
.⠀
Last day of the circuit breaker, but honestly, nothing much is gonna change on my side 🧘🏻 We’ve been dutifully staying at home, stepping out to the supermarket once a week at max 🛒 I haven’t been on any transportation, be it MRT, bus or a cab in two months 🚌🚉🚖⠀
.⠀
The big plus is I’ll get to see my parents soon! 👯‍♀️ I used to see them at least twice a week, so I’m anticipating a big feast when we reunite this weekend!🍴⠀
.⠀
I'm probably not dressing like this to go to their place though, so my pretty dresses will still be staying home 🏡⠀

What's the first non-CB thing you're gonna do when the gates open slightly from tomorrow? ⛩😷🍃
