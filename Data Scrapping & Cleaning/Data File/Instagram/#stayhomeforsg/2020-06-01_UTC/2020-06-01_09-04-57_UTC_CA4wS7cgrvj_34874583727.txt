Introducing the newest flavour of our burnt cheesecake - Biscoff! Everybody loves cookie butter, and here I have my newest creation. With a biscoff cake batter, biscoff drizzled within the cake before it's baked and biscoff drizzled all over the cheesecake, this is BISCOFF HEAVEN. $38 for a whole 6" cake, or preorder slices at $7 per slice. 
DM to order!
