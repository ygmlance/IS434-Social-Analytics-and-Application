Noodles with noodle sauce, as what my girl calls it. I used to make this 焼きうどんYaki Udon for her bento.
She’d go to school everyday with a bento cos she hated the food in school. And I had to think of different foods to make that she could bring and won’t spoil in our hot n humid climate. This was one of her favs.
