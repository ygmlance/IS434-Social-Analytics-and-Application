#Throwback of my No Oven Milo Lava Cake

I was very upset to fail the Milo Lava Cake twice - first time "overcook" till no lava (my video ðŸ¤§ðŸ˜­), second time can't even form the cake shape after burning the cloth used to covered the wok cover *SIGH*. It's only when I was trying to check if silicone or aluminum is 'less toxic' when used in air fryer, then I realised despite the Silicone cupcake mold I used is easier to clean and 'nonstick', it is also a poor heat conduction that can be unstable and interfere with leavening. With this, I found an excuse to forgive my 2 failures (lol, ignoring the possibility that I might have missed out on some instructions.) [Recipe]
