Gifts come in many shape and sizes. My most important gift during this CB period is friendship. Friendship is not about who you‚Äôve known the longest. It‚Äôs about who came, and never left your side. 
I am thankful to all of you who support me, comfort me, understand me and bring surprises to my life. 
Happy Monday to start June. Let‚Äôs celebrate the last day of CB and hope it will never return again üçæ
