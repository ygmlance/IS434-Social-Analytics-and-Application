Less than 24hours and it’s back to school routine 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 ⁣⁣

How did you prep your kids about going back to school after a LONG summer ☀️ holidays at home? #stayhomeforsg ⁣⁣

For me, besides nagging at them to put on their masks whenever they are in school, handle masks the proper way, preparing all the necessary sanitizers, wet tissues and extra masks into the school bag just in case they dirty it 🤣🤣🤣 ⁣⁣

Besides all of the above, I also prep them with probiotics to build their immunity. @oceanhealthsg delicious banana flavoured probiotics chewable tablet, specially formulated with 8 strains of clinically proven live bacteria to promote and protect daily wellness for your kids is approved by my boys 💯💯💯 ⁣⁣
I have to keep reminding them it’s only one tablet per day 😂 ⁣⁣

Kids!!!! ARE YOU READY FOR SCHOOL? 🎒🎒 #idoubtso⁣⁣

Lots of different timing to note down on my calendar as reminders because school staggers their arrival time and pick up time. You see the bottle of Gingko Omega Alertness Formula there? It’s for me to take it so I can remember all the timings and fight all the fatigue from logistics 😆✨👌🏼💕🌈 ⁣⁣
