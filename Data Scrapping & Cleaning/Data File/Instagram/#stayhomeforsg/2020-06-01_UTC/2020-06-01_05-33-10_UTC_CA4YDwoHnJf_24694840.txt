Last day of our circuit breaker but not my last day for WFH. Today hubs prepared something different and easy. Missing some of our favourite soups from soup spoon....here's our simple lunch:
🍅 𝕋𝕒𝕟𝕘𝕪 𝕥𝕠𝕞𝕒𝕥𝕠 𝕤𝕠𝕦𝕡 🍅
Serves 4
1. 1 kg of tomatoes
2. 1 bulb garlic
3. 1 carrot
4. 1 onion
5. 2 stalks of celery
Super healthy cos fresh tomatoes are used and we didn't add any butter, milk or cream.
....
Ciabatta toasted with garlic, butter and mayo spread, topped with gouda cheese.
