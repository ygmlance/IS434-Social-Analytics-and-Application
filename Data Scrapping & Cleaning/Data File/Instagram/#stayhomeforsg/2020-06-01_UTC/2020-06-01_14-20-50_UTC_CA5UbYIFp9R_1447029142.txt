(RECIPE) Golden pomfret fish fry Indian style.🐟 First ate this in Dubai. Love it then and now!! The spice coupled with the heat there makes for an explosive combination. 🔥🔥
It's one of those style that I revisit often as my family enjoys this too.
I wanted to keep everything from this beautiful pomfret from @scaledbyahhuakelong intact- nose to tail( all 600g 😁) as I love the crispy fins, tail and head.
