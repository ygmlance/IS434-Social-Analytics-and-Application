Ending the historic end-of-circuit-breaker day with a homecooked Hainanese Chicken Rice. Yay!🤩 We are not Hainanese so we borrow a little help from my fave brand of premix sauces ($6.35) to make this very delicious meal. The chicken rice is so on point n bursting with flavour.💯The chicken could be better n fatter but I’m grateful for enough protein in a meal. I also love all the sauces given in the premix pack. I’m all ready for the Phase 1 re-opening, with my face mask n social distancing.💪🏼😷😆 <CBDay56> #sgfood @primataste #hainanesechickenrice #homemade #stayhomeforsg #jiakpahpah #tiramisooojiaks #jiakjiakjiak #jinhojiak ✔️✔️✔️
