[Snapshots or Circuit Breaker in Singapore üá∏üá¨]‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
The world has become a strange place because of the coronavirus pandemic.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Around the world, different governments implemented a range of measures from stay home notice to lockdown to movement control orders were implemented. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Singapore entered the ‚ÄúCircuit Breaker‚Äù period from 7 April 2020 to 1 June 2020 to pre-empt escalating COVID-19 infections.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Why was it called ‚ÄúCircuit Breaker‚Äù?‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
The Singapore government decided to make a decisive move to prevent escalating infections with significant stricter measures. Hence, a ‚ÄúCircuit Breaker‚Äù was enforced to slow down the spread of of COVID-19. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
During this time, Singaporeans were advised to stay home as much as possible. ‚ÄúCircuit Breaker‚Äù or CB (an unfortunate acronym that can be linked to a certain Hokkien dialect term) forced everyone to stay home, slow down and re-evaluate everything that defined pre-conceived notions of normalcy and equality / equity.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Here some snapshots I captured on my Iphone during the CB period! üì∑ ‚Å£‚Å£
