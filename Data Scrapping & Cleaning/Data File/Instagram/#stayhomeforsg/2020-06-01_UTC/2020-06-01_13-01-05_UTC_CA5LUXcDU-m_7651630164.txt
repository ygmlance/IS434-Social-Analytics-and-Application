Baked these 9 swiss rolls for hub's team on last Saturday. They were coffee rolls filled with chocolate mousse cream.
Asked hub if I should do some deco art roll but he said just a simple one will do. Luckily I listened because I spent 5 hrs from start to end starting at 12 midnight (now, you can guess what time I sleep that day ðŸ˜´). LO doesn't want the daddy to make him sleep so....ðŸ˜¬
Still have problem rolling them nicely (not something new...hahaah)
Also hope the taste was not that bad..ermm..it's the thought that counts right? ðŸ¤£
