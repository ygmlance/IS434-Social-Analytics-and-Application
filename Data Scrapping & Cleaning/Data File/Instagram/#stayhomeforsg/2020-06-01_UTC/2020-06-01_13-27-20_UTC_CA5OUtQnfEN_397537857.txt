#CircuitBreakerSG D-56

I marinated some pork with homemade garlic Char Siew sauce using @KwongWohHingSauceFactory Premium Light Soya Sauce & Premium Dark Soya Sauce. Cooked the Char Siew in a rice cooker before grilling it in the turbo oven for the last few minutes.

Was meant to be another 3-dish & rice kinda dinner but somehow it's turned into Char Siew Wonton Noodle. All thanks to @Foodsomaniasg for sending some handmade fresh Wonton & Shrimp Paste over this afternoon.
