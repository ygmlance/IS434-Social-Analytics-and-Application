Pandan Chicken! Use the biggest and longest pandan leaves you can find to wrap the marinated chicken, and use smaller pieces of chicken, I got greedy with my chicken pieces and had to use toothpicks to seal the leaves in place. I deep fried these but you can oil the leaves and bake them as well for a healthier alternative.
