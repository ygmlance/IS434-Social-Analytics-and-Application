Day 20 of level 2 - 60 Seconds challenge - Wall Bird Dog!! Not sure why it’s called that but it’s a good reason to find out more about this unusual exercise. Stand facing a wall at arm’s length distance and lean into it. Then raise left leg straight back and right hand straight up so that they form a straight line. Very good for exercising the core and strengthening the back muscles. You can alternate before sides for the full 60 seconds, or 10 reps of each side before switching. 2 sets of 60 seconds for level 2.
