Day 56 of #CircuitBreaker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It’s the last day of the circuit breaker but to be frank, i feel like it’s pretty much the same. It’s going to be the circuit breaker feeling until we have the freedom to be out as long as we like, and to travel.

Had this crumbed pork dish for lunch today. Prior to me learning how to cook, this used to be my favorite dish. But so hard to perfect though. And not all pork loins are the same. Some are dry and tough and we won’t know before hand.

Btw featured is my favourite plate. Carted it all the way back from NZ. So happens my favourite cup is also from NZ. Coincidence probably. .
