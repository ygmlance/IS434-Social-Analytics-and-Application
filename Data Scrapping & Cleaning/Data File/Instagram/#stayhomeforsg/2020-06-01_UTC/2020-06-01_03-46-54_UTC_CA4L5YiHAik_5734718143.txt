ACTIVITY #2 - STARGAZING ☁️🌟✨🌟✨☁️ What better way than to unwind under a starry sky before bedtime. Cuddle up with the children and talk about the galaxy far far away and ask them how many stars they can count.

If you live in an area which is not too brightly lit at night, open your curtains and stare out to the vast skies.

If not you could always be creative and opt for a star projector at home for that extra bedtime fun. 🤩
