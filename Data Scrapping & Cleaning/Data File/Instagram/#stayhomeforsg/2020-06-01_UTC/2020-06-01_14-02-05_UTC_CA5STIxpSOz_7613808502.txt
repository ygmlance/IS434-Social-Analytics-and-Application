Happy Monday! 🌤
.
My daughter; Nirelle likes to create characters and tell fun stories about them to entertain us, the family. For few days to come, I will share one of her story which she has written, when the world still battling the invisible beast and what we can do best was to stay home and remain in good spirits. Titled "Talent Show", I refined her drawings into clearer illustrations to interpret the story.
♡
I'd just like to celebrate!! 🎉
🌈 Children's imagination and their view of the world.☁️
Through her eyes, this world we live in is always fascinating and wonderful, no matter what's going on beyond her understanding. 
Isn't it heartwarming?
