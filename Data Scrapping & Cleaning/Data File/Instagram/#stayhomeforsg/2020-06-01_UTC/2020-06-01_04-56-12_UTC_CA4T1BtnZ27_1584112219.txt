Day 56 of Circuit Breaker...
Finally the day everyone is looking forward to.ðŸ˜€ Kids are going back to school tmr but I'll still be #WFH (don't know till when...) Going through the list to make sure they have the essential stuff(extra mask, hand sanitizer, wet tissue etc...). This is even more excited or tense than a normal school reopens. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… Hope they will get used to the "new norm" after coping at home for 55 days...

Meanwhile,  here is our simple lunch on the last day of CB... can't imagine I have been cooking over 100+ meals for the past 8 weeksðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª
