Brunch... cos we are not in time for breakfast!! School starting tml and will be back to the 6.20am routine, so we decided to sleep a little later today!!! ⁣

Our menu ... ⁣
🍞 Homemade bread cut into thick slice and top with generous amount of homemade garlic butter. Toasted and enjoy the crispness of the toast and aroma from the garlic butter 😋⁣

🍄 Mini cups is another frozen prata hack. Made the prata into cups, and top it with Shiitake mushrooms (stir fry with butter, salt &pepper) from @mushroomkingdom_sg  and cheese, and airfried it. ⁣
