        "text": "I had my first outbreaks and I was tested back in 2010 for both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Both my husband and I tested positive for HSV-1 but negative for HSV-2. Last year I found out my husband was cheating, so I decided to do a retest on all STDs including HSV-1 and HSV-2, only difference is that this time I went to a different clinic. Anyway I tested positive for HSV-1 which I knew I had but surprisingly HSV-2 as well, I was so upset and got divorced with my husband. 3 months ago a friend of mine recommended me to an African herbalist Herbal Dr Patrick , I explained everything that I have been passing through all these years to him and he encouraged me that I will be cured completely!. I ordered for his herbal exploit/protocol and used it accordingly to his direction and within 17 days of using the herbal medicine I was cured completely from my HSV-1 and HSV-2. I'm so relieved to say that I've not had even one outbreak and I was tested negative by my doctor. I'm feeling so great! from within and I truly endorse this product, it really works. His herbal medicine is very active and effective. You can contact the herbal doctor on email.....\u00a0patrickherbalcenter1@gmail.com\n\u00a0or WhatsApp him with +2348118116254\n@dr.patrick_omohan7",
