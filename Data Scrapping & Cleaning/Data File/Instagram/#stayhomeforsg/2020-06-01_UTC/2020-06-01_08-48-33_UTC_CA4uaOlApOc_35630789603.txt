This is a quote that helps me stand back up when I'm discouraged and my day feels like "blah". First came across this word of wisdom when I attended a motivational talk and upon reflection in my own life indeed difficult times are a passing phase leading to a better me.

Think about a baby, its tough when he/she first tries to walk and sometimes the fall is bad, and the feeling sucks, but its the perseverance that finally enables him/her to walk on both feet. Imagine if he/she had given up!? What is your quote that gets you up when the going gets tough? Share with me in the comments!
