K√∂ttbullar!! / Swedish meatballs üá∏üá™‚Å£
‚Å£
Served with potatoes, picked cucumber, and minted peas. Out of lingonberry jam and IKEA is closed, so made do with cranberry. The sauce for the k√∂ttbullar was amazing and so easy to make. Thanks @tobias.iversen for the recipe (and for translating it for me)! Sweden please grant me PR status, I love you, tack s√• mycket‚Å£
