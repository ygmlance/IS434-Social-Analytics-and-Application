It can be overwhelming putting together a plan for yourself. At this point, there is a lot out there, a lot of content that you're being fed through your feed🤪. ⁣
⁣
But what's most important is that you stick to a PLAN, this helps to build consistency and allows you to see progress which is a HUGE MOTIVATOR. Stick to your plan for at least a month and then you can advance to more focused (working on different parts of the body) workouts! ⁣
⁣
As you start out, go for full-body circuits. In my plan, I've incorporated both cardio and strength focused circuits. 𝐈𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐨𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐨 𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬! Remember muscular hypertrophy now will see you through your old age! ⁣
⁣
PS: Modify the exercises in each circuit to best fit your level of fitness. You'll see yourself progressing if you CONSISTENTLY stick with it. ⁣
