Day #56/56 of #CovidCircuitBreaker: 54 days of daily workouts. 2 days of period cramps. 2 #inversions unlocked - #TripodHeadstand (which I was stuck at for half a year) & #ForearmStand (tho I still need a security blanket support). Endless Zoom meetings. 4 online assessments. 4 Korean dramas. $100 Decathalon vouchers won (& hopefully more!😉). >10 Bubble Teas. What a journey! Please stay safe so we can sail through Phase 1 smoothly and be back at the gym again. 🙏🏻💪🏻 #stayhome #stayhomeforsg #stayhomeforsgchallenge #sgunited #singaporetogether #circuitbreaker #yoga #pinchamayurasana
