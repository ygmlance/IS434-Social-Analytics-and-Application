Pandan Muffins with Goji Berries, kids & toddlers friendly recipe ❤️
.
.
Ingredients: 60 ml pandan leaves water (add more if needed), 1/3 cup full cream milk, 1 cup flour (wholemeal or all purpose), 2 tsp baking powder, 3 tbsp goji berries, 1 tbsp vanilla extract & 3 tbsp brown sugar.
.
.
.
Mix all ingredients well and bake in preheated oven at 180C for 20 minutes! Easy muffin recipe my kids loved to mix ingredients themselves without much help from mommy. Mommy helped to bake in oven only! 🤣
.
.
.
Try to add goji berries in your baking because it’s super healthy, good for eyes and full of antioxidants! ❤️

My kids love to stay home & play baking. How about your kids? 😉
