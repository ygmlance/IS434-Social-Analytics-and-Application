Just like my family, Singapore will always be precious to me. What does the Singapore Flag mean to you? For me, it represents family because whether in good or bad times, we are all in it together... especially in unprecedented times we are experiencing now. Even though we have been confined to to our homes for close to two months now, I am thankful that I am able to spend more time with my kids, have more meals and play together as a family.

Unfortunately, not all of us can afford the same luxury as many essential workers and migrant workers are sacrificing their personal family time to ensure that Singapore keeps chugging along. If you would like to show your support for these tireless workers, you can play your part by flying the Singapore flag outside your home. Let's stay united as one big SG family!
