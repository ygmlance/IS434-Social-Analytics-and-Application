DAY 55 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
(countdown ... 1 days to go)
Cod with Stir-fried Tofu

Freedom for many arrives tomorrow morning! Lets hope and pray with all our might that all goes well. It should, it must, it has to, because the little ones step out and go back to school. 
On my plate is a slice of cod, seasoned with salt & pepper, and  pan-grilled in butter. Stir-fried the tofu in soy sauce, peanuts, dry red chilli, onion, garlic, red bell pepper and oyster sauce. .
