Tomorrow will be a day of celebration as our mosques will be reopening its doors after months of closure. Pretty sure that a lot of people miss the air of serenity and happiness they bring.

But even so, let’s not get too overexcited and overcrowd the mosques. For those of us who can perform our worships at home, let’s continue to #prayhomeforSG, especially for our pakciks and makciks, and atoks and neneks. The last thing we want is for our past sacrifices to go in vain.

Pray that Allah safeguards us and will be pleased with our efforts.
