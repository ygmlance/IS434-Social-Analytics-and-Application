After 56 LONG DAYS #Singapore will exit the #CircuitBreaker tomorrow and enter the Phase One of the re-opening. This stretch will be long remembered as one of the most challenging periods we all have had to face. Even if the challenge is not yet over, and our bars, restaurants, retails shops or swiming pools still have to remain closed, its worth to take a moment and acknowledge the efforts of this amazing nation ❤. Hopefully infection rates will remain low and stable so Phase Two could happen before the end of June and so finally we could meet people outside of our household again 🙏🏼😊
