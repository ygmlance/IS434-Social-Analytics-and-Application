Summary for the day, last day of #circuit breaker .
• Nice breakfast, baos from Madam Ling. Thank you @steppets
.
• Made 2 Castella cakes today, 1 chocolate swirl and 1 Pandan. So Jared can bring for his snack in school tomorrow. Pandan is for the rest to eat (cos they finished the Chocolate Swirl already)
.
• Kalyn walking a bit more steady now. Still a little flimsy but getting there. Keira started walking since 10months old then Kalyn at 14 months and lastly Jared at 15 months. There was a saying, the older a toddler learns to walk, a better life he has. Indeed I find it quite true
