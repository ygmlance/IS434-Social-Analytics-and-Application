🍕MUSHROOM PIZZA🍕⁣
⁣
Real Food, my favorite local vegetarian restaurant of all time, offers island-wide delivery. 🛵🥡 My family has ordered their wild mushroom pizza multiple times during the circuit breaker—the combo of cheddar cheese, dried herbs & spices, vegan “parmesan”, fresh garlic in olive oil, and homemade sourdough crust is *that* good! 🤤 You can really taste the love and labor in all their food. ⁣
