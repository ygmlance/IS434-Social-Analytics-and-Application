Tomorrow marks the end of the #circuitbreaker, which means some of us will be heading back to the office. In line with social distancing and safety measures that are currently in place, we’ve streamlined the ordering and pick-up process at our stores with the launch of the digital KIPOS card.

Here’s what you need to know about your KIPOS card: - Sign up for an account online and make sure to show our team members your digital KIPOS card to earn rebate points for future redemption. - Our digital card also functions as an e-wallet. Top up your card online to make payment over the counter or via our webstore. - Friends with someone who’s a KIPOS fan? Our digital card also works as a gift card! Simply create an account online, top up the gift card with your desired amount and WhatsApp us the Membership number of the account you want the credits to be credited into.
