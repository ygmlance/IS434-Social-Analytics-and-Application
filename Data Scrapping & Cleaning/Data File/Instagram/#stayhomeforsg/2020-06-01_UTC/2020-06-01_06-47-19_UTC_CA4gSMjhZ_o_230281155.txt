This is specially for you, healthcare heroes! The National Museum is lighting up amidst these dark times, in solidarity and appreciation of the sacrifices made by our healthcare personnel in this battle against the pandemic. Thank you for tirelessly keeping our community safe.

Let’s keep up the great effort and continue to stay home, stay safe, and stay united. Together, we will get through this as one united nation. ❤️ Thank you @mjd.pro for the spectacular light projection!
