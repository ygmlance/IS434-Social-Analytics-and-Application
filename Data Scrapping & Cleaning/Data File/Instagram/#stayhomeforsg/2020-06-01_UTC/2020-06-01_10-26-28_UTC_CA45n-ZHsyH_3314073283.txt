LDR Shoot (a.k.a. long-distance relationship shoot) | Like many other separated couples, Zack and I have yet to meet each other in the past 2 months of Circuit Breaker. Being a photographer, I decided to "lock down" these moments as we pictured ourselves at home and pieced the shots together to form this series. Read further to find out the story behind each shot.
.
Photo 1 - As always, we keep each other in our minds.
.
Photo 2 - We start our day with our favourite drinks. Coffee for him; tea for her.
.
Photo 3 - We dream about heading the outdoors. He wishing for a dive; she yearning for a trek.
.
Photo 4 - Always keeping in mind to put on our masks if we are heading out.
.
Photo 5 - We do miss each other's presence.
.
Photo 6 - But we live each day with positivity.
.
Photo 7 - Well, sometimes we do still need companionship. Thankful to have the little neighbourhood cat. ðŸ˜¸
.
Photo 8 - As the night falls, we don't forget about our #kfSignatureNight!
.
Photo 9 - Till then, we look forward to that day when we can meet in person again.
.
Photo 10 - That's the end of the series!
.
COVID-19 has no doubt brought much inconvenience to our lives - physically, mentally, social and economically. However, with the right mindset, I'm sure we will all emerge stronger out of this. We may well need to thank COVID-19 & Circuit Breaker as we would not have done such a shoot like this.
.
May we all soon be able to meet our loved ones who are currently living apart! This too shall pass! #DearCovid19SG @nycsg @dstnctsg
