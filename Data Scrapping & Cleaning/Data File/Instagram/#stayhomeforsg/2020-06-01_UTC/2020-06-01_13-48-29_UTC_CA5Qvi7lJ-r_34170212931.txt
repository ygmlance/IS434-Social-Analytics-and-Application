“In spending most days at home I've found myself staring out the window more often than usual. Some mornings I wake to the sun unfurling itself to the sound of birds, other evenings I'm greeted by skies looking pretty in pink. Towering cotton clouds. Rainy midnights. Blue afternoon skies, without clouds. Tangerine sunsets. Here's what I think: the skies have always been beautiful, we were just too preoccupied to realise. Too fixated on our paths on the ground to really notice. Nothing's really changed, though I'm sure the sky is beaming at the attention that it's been getting of late. How we've been looking up more, taking stock of the constants we have. And there's really no set path or process to cope with this period we're in. But, the light at the end of the tunnel is coming closer with each day. Slowly and surely, we'll find our way out.”
