Last day of circuit breaker for us in Singapore - this 2020 will definitely be remembered by many and over many nations who are affected by Covid-19. This pandamic definitely allow us to see humanity in new light. 
Looking forward to the 'new' normal and keeping the faith that all will be renewed.

Thank you all frontline heroes and volunteers to brave this storm! 🙋‍♀️
