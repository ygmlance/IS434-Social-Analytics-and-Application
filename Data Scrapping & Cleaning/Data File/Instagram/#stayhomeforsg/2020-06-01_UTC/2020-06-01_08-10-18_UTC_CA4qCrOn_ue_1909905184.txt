KEVIN CHIAK (ex-National Bodybuilder and Mr Singapore 2010) joins us on Ep 22 of IN YOUR HOUSE!

#IYH is a new project by SportSG, created specially for this period when Singaporeans are staying at home due to Covid-19. It's a series of segments showcasing Singaporeans from all walks of life, both in and outside of the country, as they cope with work-from-home orders. In this Skype/Zoom interview based show, we'll discuss each guest's exercise routines, family, the various types of food to stay healthy, leisure activities, plus positive reinforcement messages.

In Pt 2 of Ep 22 on Mon 1 June, be sure to catch, SportSG's very own RAJ KUMAR, as he catches up with KEVIN (Business owner of a Gym and Cat Cafe, plus the Founder of Fitness Movement)

His name is synonymous with the sport of Bodybuilding in Singapore as Kevin at the age of 54, is still busy busy busy. As the Founder of Fitness Movement, he's been able to organise annual events to cater to those who're still into bodybuilding as well as others, who are now into Sports Physique. His events are the only local ones which sees, amateurs and professionals coming together to compete in a sport which they truly love. But at the moment, these events have been compromised due to Covid-19. And there is uncertainty of hosting the key events in 2020 at all. 
As an owner of a new Cat-Cafe, Kevin's also been unable to get the business started due to the CB measures. As the Partner of a public Gym based at Scape, that too has been shut for business for the past 8-10 weeks. And Kevin's biggest fear is keeping the operations ongoing for another few weeks, hoping for the authorities to give the all-clear sign, to reopen soon. 
Despite all the negativity, Kevin is maintaining a cool and collected mind, and working on post-Covid operations. So all that and more are revealed from 415pm onwards on Get Active TV Facebook Page!
