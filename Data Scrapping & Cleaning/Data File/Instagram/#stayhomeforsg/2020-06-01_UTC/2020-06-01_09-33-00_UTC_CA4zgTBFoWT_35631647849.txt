Creative Movement encourages participants to:
1. Be more aware of their bodily sensations
2. And therefore have better control of regulating their body.
-- “I liked the session. The facilitator demonstrated the instructions very well and was amazing with the Zoom platform (music, visuals and all). It was comforting seeing everyone exercise together at their different homes. I felt safer and more in control with my mind and body, which means a lot to me. Thank you for taking the time and putting in effort for the session.” - Participant, CSAY Creative Movement
