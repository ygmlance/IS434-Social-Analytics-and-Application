‘My Hero is You’ is an illustrated e-book written for kids to understand the COVID-19 outbreak. The author, Helen Patuck, drew on a survey of 1,700 children, parents and teachers around the world to create a story that explores children’s questions and fears about the pandemic. 
A fantasy creature, Ario, brings readers on a journey across time zones and continents – showing how people experience safe distancing but stay connected. It’s a story about friendship, hope, kindness, and appreciating the heroes in our lives. Developed in collaboration with multiple humanitarian organisations, the book is available free at the link below.
