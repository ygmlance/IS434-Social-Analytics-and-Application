Tried to do a #gyudon or should I say #wagyudonburi using the on sale #wagyusteak at 13 bucks from Cold Storage for this #stayhomeforsg Taste shiok especially with the #gyukakusauce drizzled over it. Must say simple beef must paired with the #whitepart of the #springonion is really good pairing with the oily beef. Also mental note to self - Never try to do a #sousvideegg without the machine. #homecooked
