21 May 2020: Couldn't get enough of Korean food.🍴
. 
We cheated and used a frozen spicy octopus premix and added tteokbokki (rice cakes), ssam (cabbage), leeks, beansprouts and spring onions. Complete with perilla leaves (I love you...) and loads of banchan (small side dishes). QD couldn't resist adding in some rameon to complete the meal. So good that we bought another for another day... 😅😋
