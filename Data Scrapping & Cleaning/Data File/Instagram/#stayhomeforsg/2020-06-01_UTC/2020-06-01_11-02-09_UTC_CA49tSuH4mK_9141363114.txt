Itâ€™s time this cooking mama resume her work ðŸ¤£Dinner is Linguini tossed with sliced garlic, Johnsonvilleâ€™s Smoked sausages with a side of Pan fried Salmon. We also have Cibatta bread spread with Garlic Parsley Butter served with Mushroom soup - all from @oldsengchoong. Itâ€™s sooo yummy. Can you tell the lack of greens? I have been hiding at home and I really need to make a groceries trip soon. School starts tomorrow and Iâ€™m actually really worried. Keeping my fingers cross and pray all kids stay safe. STAY HOME; STAY SAFE. #sgunitedðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ #stayhomeforSG #stayhomestaysafe #sgcircuitbreaker #dawnlcooks #homecookedmeals #homecookeddinner #homecookedwithlove #instafood #instachef #cookingwithconscience #homemade #cookingforkids #cookingforfussykids #fussyeaters #singaporehomecooks #sgcooking #singaporecooking #sahmlife #sahmcooks #dinnerideas #foodphotography #foodstagram
