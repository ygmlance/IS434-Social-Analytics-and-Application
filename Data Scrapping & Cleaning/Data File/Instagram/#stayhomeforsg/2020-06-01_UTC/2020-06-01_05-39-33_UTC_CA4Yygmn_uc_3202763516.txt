Tasty cube stir fry...don't know what else to call it. Troopers love it. #momsrequest
Cubed tau kwa ( beancurd ), long bean, char siew ( good way to use up leftover char siew ). It's a vegetable and meat dish all in. So you can get away with 1 less dish. 
Recipe for cube stir fry : 
1) Roast peanuts in dry pan over medium heat. Remove skins from peanuts by placing hot peanuts straight from pan onto clean kitchen towel. Wrap towel like a pouch and lightly squash and turn base. Pick the peanuts without skins and set aside.
2) Cut firm beancurd ( tau kwa ) into cubes and pat dry on kitchen paper. Shallow fry in oil till all sides are browned.
3) Chop long beans into short pieces. Cut cooked char siew into cubes. 
4) In little oil, fry dried shrimps then add chopped garlic a few mins later. Once garlic is golden and fragrant, turn down heat to low and add chye poh ( pickled radish ). I used equal parts of sweet and salty chye poh but could stick to only salty chye poh too. Turning down heat will prevent the chye poh from popping out of the pan ( like popcorn ðŸ˜… ). Add deseeded red chilli strips. 
5) Add long beans then water and fry till 3/4 soft or cooked.
6) Add beancurd and char siew.
7) Add fish sauce and white pepper to taste. 
8) Add peanuts last to retain crunch. Serve.
