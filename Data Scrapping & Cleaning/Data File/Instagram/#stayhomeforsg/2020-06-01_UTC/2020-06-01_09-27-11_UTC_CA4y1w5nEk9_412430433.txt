Today marks the end of the Circuit Breaker. A good 56 days of staying locked at home and facing our devils.

What are some fears you have come face to face with? What discomfort have you faced? 
I faced my fear of drawing. That’s one of my struggles. I wanted to draw well or at least it must look decent. Decent means good enough to be shown. My work involves a lot of images in my vision, yet I can’t draw them out well. So in these 8 weeks of CB, I committed to drawing and tried new styles. But I never got close to my real fear of drawing. That’s drawing human figures. My style of human figures has never progress from my primary school days. Geez.... I tried to draw some human figures in the last 4 days. And I had trouble getting it right. Erased and redrew, erased and redrew. That went on a couple of times. I was very frustrated and sought help from my kids even. One of them told me “perfection is the enemy of success”. Yes, I agree, but I just can’t get past myself. That didn’t look close to what I saw in my vision. How am I going to get this right?

Sometimes, we put ourselves under too much stress. Followed too much ‘standards’. And tried to fit into a box. So I have always thought how drawings must look professional or at least decent before it can be good enough. I was too hard on my drawings and judged how it must be. In the last 2 months, I’m learning to watch not my drawings but my fears. To look at self-judgement and self-sabotage. And how harsh I have been towards myself. Way more than how others have judged me.

What happened to the drawing?
I completed it: googled some images, did some deep breathing and sketched from the sample image. I am happy with the outcome. Happier to have met my demons!

How about you?
