We may not be there yet, but we're certainly closer than before. While our beaches remain closed, here are our Southern Islands reminding you that better days are coming! As we roll into Phase One: Safe Re-opening tomorrow, some businesses will gradually reopen with safe management measures. Households can receive two visitors a day, who must be children and/or grandchildren from the same household. Graduating students from primary and secondary schools can attend school daily. Essential care services will continue. Everyone should continue to work from home, where possible. Remember to mask up, stay safe and practise safe distancing at all times! #SGUnited #stayhomeforSG
