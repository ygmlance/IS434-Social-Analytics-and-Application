With work from home blurring all gaps between work and home life, need to deliberately take breaks just to maintain sanity. Todayâ€™s afternoon rain was God-sent. The sound of the rain and the cool breeze that followed, made me stop what I was doing and sit and stare, together with my little boy. 56th #ajoyaday #lockdown #singaporecircuitbreaker #covid19 #singapore #stayhomeforSG #rains
