Hi boys and girls! Have you ever wanted to grow your own plants? Let our Young Storyteller show you how! Don't worry, they won't grow into enormous turnips like the #StayHomeStorytelling video uploaded last Friday 😉⁣
⁣
🍅 Step 1: Get some seeds you want to plant 🌱 Remember to get help from your mummies and daddies if you would like to cut any fruits or vegetables!⁣
⁣
🌏 Step 2: Get some soil and put it in a pot or a small container.⁣
⁣
🤲 Step 3: Dig a small hole in the soil and put in your seeds! ⁣
💧Step 4: Cover up the seeds and give them some water.
⁣
☀️ Step 5: Place your pot or container near the window to ensure it gets enough sunlight.
⁣
And you're done! Remember to water your seeds regularly and watch them grow big and strong.⁣
