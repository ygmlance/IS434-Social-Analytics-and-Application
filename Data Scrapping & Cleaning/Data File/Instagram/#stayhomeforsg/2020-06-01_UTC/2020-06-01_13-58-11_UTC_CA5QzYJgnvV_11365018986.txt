Not a natural talking to my own face on the screen (and I really have to credit my Sports Psyche lecturer for this quote Cos that was what she said when I caught her live sharing 😍🤣) so thought I’ll have some practice time reading my so-called script. 😂

But I still NG-ed many times just on the introduction, luckily not the workout part 🥵 .

Before that I took time to sort things back in order, my heart fluttered when I slotted the springs back into the equipment and replaced freshly washed straps. 💓 (Crayy woman I know 😂)

Circuit Breaker, THE END.
WELCOME to the NEW NORM.

A norm I have embraced; a norm that although frustrated me at times, gave me every other opportunity to appreciate the beauty in nature, the strength of community and a hope of an incredibly vast network. 
The world is scary out there, seatbelts tight, folks.

I didn’t sneak out or in, I applied for business exemption to enter the premise. .
