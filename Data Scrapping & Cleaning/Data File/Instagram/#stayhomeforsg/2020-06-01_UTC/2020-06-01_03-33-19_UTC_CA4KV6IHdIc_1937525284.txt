Finally dug into my Apple Cider Tart which was chilling in the fridge overnight 🍎 should have made more apple cider custard but I was worried the tart would overflow, used Strongbow apple cider as that’s the only brand I saw in store and it turns out quite alright #applecidertart #circuitbreakerbaking #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomeforsg
