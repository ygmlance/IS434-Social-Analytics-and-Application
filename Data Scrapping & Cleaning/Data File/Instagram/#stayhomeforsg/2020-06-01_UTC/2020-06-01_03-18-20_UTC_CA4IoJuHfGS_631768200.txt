1st June , Day 56 of Circuit breaker.
Salad breakfast.
Trying out my last batch of  homemade Croutons with Salad. 
This was made on Wednesday and it is still crispy. I am not going to buy any ready made Croutons with preservatives anymore.
The rest of the ingredients are very fresh Romaine lettuces,  shredded chicken, hard boiled egg,  organic raisins,  tomatoes.
I used freshly squeezed lemon juice.
I am not a fan of high fat salad dressing kind of person.😁 P/S - please refer back to my last Wednesday post on how to make the Croutons.  #jasmine_homemade #jasmine_salad #jasmine_mickey_kitchen #jasmine_made_salad
