Today is the last day of #circuitbreaker and some of us are returning to work tomorrow. It seems that the situation is slowly getting better but let's not forget to keep our #masks on and maintain proper hygiene so that Singapore can be #Covid19 free soon. Thank you @whywendywrites for tagging us in this great shot üì∏!
