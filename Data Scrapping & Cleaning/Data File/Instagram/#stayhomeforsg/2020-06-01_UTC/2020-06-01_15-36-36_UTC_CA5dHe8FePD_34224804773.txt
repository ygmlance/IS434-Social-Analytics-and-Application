21 May 2020: Interrupting the homecooked meals feed with a special delivery(ies). QD got me flowers 💐 (for the first time ever) and it was delivered by our friend, G, who also gifted us a delicious basque cheesecake 🥧 from No Sleep Club. It was so good, especially with Vietnamese black coffee ☕. We gave half of it to my parents who loved it so much, my mum said she couldn't help having a second slice.
