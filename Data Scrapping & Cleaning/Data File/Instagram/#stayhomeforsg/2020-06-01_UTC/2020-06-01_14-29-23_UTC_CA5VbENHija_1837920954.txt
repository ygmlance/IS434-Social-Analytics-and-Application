Last Day #circuitbreaker reflections ~ how was your last 2 months like?

I picked up for my short fast runs & totally became a sloth 🦥 at elevation and endurance training. Oh well, the good thing that came out of it is that I am able to keep pace with @i.m.sebastian on short runs and I think he’s secretly happy that I improved

Apart from running outdoors, we bought a treadmill & started on lunch time walk/runs that made us feel less guilty after indulging in our big & often fattening meals.

We tried many new recipes in cooking & baking that we probably wouldn’t have done in pre covid times. As we return to the office in the coming weeks, we’ll be eating out more often so we really appreciate this ‘luxury of time’ that we often complained we never had.

Another interesting thing I did was a DIY home salon. I colored my hair and had my own gel manicure 💅🏼 done! 
Haven’t travelled in past 3 months (longest record in 10 years) & I used to love moving about like a speedy Gonzales.
Though I do miss the social aspects of precovid times, I enjoyed the comfort of being a homebody too. I may seem like an extrovert but I think I’m an introvert 😳

So this 2 months went by in the blink of an eye and we’re off to a NEW BEGINNING - Phase 1 of A Safe Singapore starts tomorrow. 🤪 what’s the hashtag for it?
