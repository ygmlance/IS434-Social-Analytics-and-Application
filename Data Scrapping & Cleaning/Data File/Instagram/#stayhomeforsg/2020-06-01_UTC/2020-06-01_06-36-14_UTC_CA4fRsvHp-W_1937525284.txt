Lunchtime project baked and tasted - Shokupan aka Japanese Milk Bread, made the Yudane last night by mixing bread flour with boiling water, woke up early this morning to toss in more bread flour, milk, instant yeast, sugar and salt into the mixer 🍞 not sure if it’s because my yeast is not very fresh or the weather too cold, waited over an hour for the dough to rise after shaping but the bread turned out soft and fluffy so everything’s alright! #circuitbreakerbaking #lastdayofcircuitbreaker #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomeforsg #homebakedbread
