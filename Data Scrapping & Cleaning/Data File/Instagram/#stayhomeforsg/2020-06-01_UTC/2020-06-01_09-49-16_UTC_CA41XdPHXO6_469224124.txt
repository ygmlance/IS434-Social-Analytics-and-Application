A delicious way to enjoy fish is to steam and retain its freshness. While we may be familiar with both Teochew-style (with salted plums, tomatoes and salted mustard green) and Cantonese-style (shredded ginger, spring onions and light soy sauce) of preparation, our culinary team from @asianmarketcafe.sg recommends a spicy and citrusy approach to enjoy steamed fish.⁣
⁣
Tip: The key to achieve the perfect steamed fish is to watch the time and not overcook the fish.⁣
