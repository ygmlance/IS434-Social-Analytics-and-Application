Returning to campus aka office in less than 12 hours time. More than just as the academic school admin director. The more essential role is Safe Management Officer to ensure a safer environment as limited number of faculty, staff and students return to campus. Seeing rainbow outside my window reminded me of all the goodness is to come. 2 Jun 2020 will be better days to come. #StayHome #StayHomeSG #StayHomeforSG #CEE #NTUCEE
