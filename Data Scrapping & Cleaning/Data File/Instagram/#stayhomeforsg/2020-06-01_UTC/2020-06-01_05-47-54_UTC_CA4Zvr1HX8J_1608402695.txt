cooked carrot cake today but disappointed with the turn out as i forgot to wait for the egg to set. and forgot the spring onion. hubby has always been the one cooking this and i think he does a better job lol. furthermore, it's also my first time frying shishamo and as I was washing the fishes, I felt a wave of sadness while touching their lifeless bodies. omgosh I really cannot buy whole fishes again :(
