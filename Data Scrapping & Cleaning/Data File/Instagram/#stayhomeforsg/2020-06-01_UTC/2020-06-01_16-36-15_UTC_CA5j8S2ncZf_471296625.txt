I would like to thank my 3 gems at home during this period. Thank you for being such great children! Daddy and mummy enjoyed every single moment spent with u these 2 months. I’m sure the best part about this CB is spending time with their daddy, @seanwfw ! Daddy has always been busy and they rarely get to spend time with him at home. Even my mil commented, “I’m surprised the kids seem so close to daddy even though he didn’t spend much time with them!” Kids really adore their daddy so much and I’m very sure they know daddy is working hard for them that’s why! They were so happy these 2 months having spend their every days with him! Can’t thank God enough for His plans are always the best. In the midst of a pandemic, we know there’s still a silver lining. I’m grateful and thankful for the precious bonding we all had as a family. I’m sure we will all look back some day and smile just reminiscing these beautiful memories. .

Friends, continue to stay safe please. Don’t be complacent ya! I pray everyone to be healthy and safe! Embrace the new normal! Together, we can get through this and emerge stronger! #SGUnited
