[🍵Dalgona Matcha ~ Collaboration with @naturesglorysg]

This one's for matcha lovers! 💚💚💚
Made with one of my favorite dairy- free milk, Bonsoy. And the Matcha topping is sugar-free. 
Bonsoy is a truly healthy and nutritious drink.
Nature’s Glory Bonsoy is made from certified organic soybeans that are free from harmful pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and genetic modifications, all these can be commonly found in non-organic soybean beverages. 
Bonsoy is lactose-free, people who are allergic to milk can enjoy Bonsoy, a non-dairy product.
