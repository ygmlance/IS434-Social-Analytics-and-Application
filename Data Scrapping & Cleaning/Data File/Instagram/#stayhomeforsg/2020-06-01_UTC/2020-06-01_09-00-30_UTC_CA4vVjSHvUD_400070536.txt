Wrote ‚ÄùThe Person beside you‚Äù in 2011, and released it in 2014, Circles EP. üòÇ A song that talks about people who have been by your side guiding you through the good and bad. Just wanna thank @clementyangxi again for all the wonderful arrangements and being my producer! ‚ù§Ô∏è And @jakoteo for the backup vocals üò∏üò∏
