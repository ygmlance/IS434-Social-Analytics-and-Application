My aunt showed me a pic of a pretty Mille Feuille stew the other time. It looked quite easy to assemble n required very few ingredients. So I gathered my lettuce, zucchini, shabu pork slices, mushrooms n carrot, and started assembling my own. It was quite easy and took me only a few minutes to do. Made a Tom Yum broth to go with this - Mille Feuille Tom Yum stew ðŸ˜†
