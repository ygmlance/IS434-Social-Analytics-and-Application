Thank you @little.cupcake1918 for tagging me to create my own 9 squares to end the CB!

These are just 9 out of the many awesome brands I reviewed during the last 2 months. The last 2 months had been great! I enjoy taking photos of the products, trying them out and providing my reviews. How I wish I can do this full time🤣

To be honest, I am already so used to my CB life...Those who really know me will know that I am HARDLY home. I love being OUT and I dislike being home 😅 But this CB changed me totally, I actually like staying home and I now don’t really wish to go out at all 😂

I genuinely feel abit sad that CB is over, though I feel a little happy that my kids can be back in school  like a finally 😛 Hope they can still remember how to study 😆Well, onwards to better days ahead 🤗 Jiayou everyone 💪🏻
