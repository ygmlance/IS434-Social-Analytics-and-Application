Day 56, the final day of Singapore's Circuit Breaker!

Cat or owl? Some cute ear-savers to surprise your classmates/colleagues when you finally meet them, with social distancing, of course. DM for enquiries!

Inspired by @mamanbaribal , who has made cute ear-savers out of animal characters. Thank you for sharing!
Puppy yarn, 3.0mm hook.
