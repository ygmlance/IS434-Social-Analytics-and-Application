Before circuit breaker, I wasnâ€™t into bread except for the occasional Toastbox kaya toast & breakfast set in Japanâ€™s local cafe. Probably because I relate it to my childhood,  waking up early and forced (my perspective) to have our breakfast cox we will have gastric if we donâ€™t.  I know I know, mama is always right. Till now she still nags whenever she knows I havenâ€™t taken my meals. Now, as we stay home for SG, @bakerandcooksg sourdough is a regular staple. Yummy in any way. Itâ€™s interesting how preferences can be cultivated.

Todayâ€™s breakfast, sourdough  smeared with French butter then pan fried. And my weekday lunch, tuna cheese sandwich. ðŸ˜‹
