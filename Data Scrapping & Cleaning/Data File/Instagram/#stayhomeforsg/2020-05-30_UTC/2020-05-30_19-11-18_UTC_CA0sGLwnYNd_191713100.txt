🕢Dinner: Cold Cuts and Cheese Platter 
My very own version of cold cuts and cheese platter from scratch, whatever I can dig from my ‘Doraemon’ fridge.🤣 Some beef salami, honey hams, aged cheddar and edam with homemade Italian ciabatta.

Who says you can’t have an appetiser as a main?
Well, I do 😉

Buon Appetito
