~ DAY 54 OF CIRCUIT BREAKER ~ 
With all honesty and putting aside the negativity that comes together with the covid situation, we all have definitely gained memories that we wouldn’t be able to create if not for this “break” that everyone is being forced into. For me, as simple as it may seem, I’m grateful that I have my 2 adorable babies with me during this period. Being home 24/7 now has made them, or maybe just Junior, more needy than ever but I’m not complaining (😂). The simpler things in life is often overlooked and I’m glad I’m able to be here with them, as much as they are here with me too ❤ #HomeButNotAloneSG #WeAreMajulah #StayHomeForSG #SGUnited
