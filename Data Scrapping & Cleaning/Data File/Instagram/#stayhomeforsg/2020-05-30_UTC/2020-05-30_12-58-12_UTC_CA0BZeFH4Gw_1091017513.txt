BLUEBERRY LOAF WITH LEMONY EARL GREY GLAZE

Makes a 4” x 9” and a 4.5” x 3” loaf

Ingredients: •  140 grams unsalted butter, melted •  200 grams caster sugar •  4 tsp grated lemon zest •  400ml Greek yogurt or sour cream •  2 large eggs (60g each in shell) •  3 tsp baking powder •  1/2 tsp baking soda •  1/2 tsp fine sea salt •  390g plain flour •  500g blueberries (tossed in 1 tbsp icing sugar + 1/2 tsp flour if berries are sour)

FOR THE GLAZE: •  230g icing sugar •  3¼ tbsp lemon juice, strained •  2 tsp earl grey tea leaves (from about two tea bags) ………………………………………………………….. METHOD:

Preheat oven to 175°C. Grease & line tins. 
In a large bowl, whisk melted butter, sugar, lemon zest, yogurt/sour cream & eggs till smooth. 
Add baking powder, baking soda & salt. Whisk till blended, then gently fold in flour & berries. Don’t overmix. 
Pour batter into tins. Bake for 55 to 65 mins (about 45 mins for smaller tin), until tops are golden & a tester inserted into the center emerges clean. 
Cool in tins for 30 mins, unmould & cool completely on a rack.

When loaves are almost cool, make glaze. Whisk icing sugar, lemon juice & tea leaves till blended. 
Pour glaze over loaves, using a palate knife to smear it evenly. Allow at least 20 mins for icing to set before serving. .
