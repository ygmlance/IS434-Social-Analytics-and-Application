Made some braised beef noodles #红烧牛肉面 for dinner tonight. 😊

The best braised beef noodles I had was in Taiwan. I always make sure to have them when I’m there. Really missing those right now. .

This is my first attempt making this dish and it turned out quite delicious! 😋 Hubs ate happily because he loves all kinds of beef noodles. 🍝 And that makes me happy. ☺️ #gratitudediary
