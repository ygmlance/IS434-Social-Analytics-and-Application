How could I forget to document and celebrate some of the milestones or achievements we made during this CB!
. 
I'll start with the biggest one. Yes, big A wipes her own bum now after doing the big number. I tell you guys, it is a darn parenting milestone for sure. I've been waiting for this day! Lol! One down one more to go üòÇ
. 
The girls learnt a little about how putting meals together works in the kitchen.
. 
A small truckload of cat fights, but nothing communicating about problems couldn't solve.
. 
We did a little more origami and managed to fold some decent paper boats.
. 
HBL was not 100% done but we replaced it with our own ways of learning about numerical, alphabets, writing and vocabulary. What I noticed was their expansion of their vocabularies during these 2 months, having spend more time with me and more time on our Dr Seuss books and @owlreaders.club as well.
. 
Small A achieved fixing up 16 piece puzzles all by herself and she was so proud of this achievement.
. 
Both of them have become a lot better when it comes to tidying their own items (though small A still tends to bully big A sometimes and slacks on the job üòÇ)
.
Both As also put themselves to bed twice when I was so terribly sick and I really need to credit them for that. Though they're very sticky when we're out of the home, they are actually incredibly independent at home itself.
. 
My achievement? I'm alive and actually am grateful for all the good things that did happen during this CB.
. 
How about you? ‚ù§Ô∏è
