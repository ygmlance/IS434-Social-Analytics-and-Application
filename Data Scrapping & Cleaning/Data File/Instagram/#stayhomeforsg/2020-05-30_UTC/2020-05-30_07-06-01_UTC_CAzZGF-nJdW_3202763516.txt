My deflated roti soup bowl. Using #springhomebrand  #rotiprata 
It puffed up nicely like an UFO in the oven. I didn't take it out from oven immediately but left it in oven with heat turned off and it collapsed in the middle ðŸ˜¥. Another ez prep.

Notes to recipe :
1) Need to take out from 190 deg C oven immediately after 15 mins of baking to prevent collapse.
