So I had a very special birthday celebration during this CB period. 
I started my day super early & started with my decorations. 😂
Busy busy!
And all the unexpected surprise deliveries started coming in as early as 9am all the way till evening! 
These nice gestures from family and friends really touched my heart. 
And finally, happy hour 🥂 on zoom with colleagues and friends before dinner time.
All done at home but it felt like a big party 🥳 
Ended the day with bodyaches & sore legs but it was definitely all worth it! What a day!
