Saturday’s dinner - Shepherd Pie using leftover veggies from yesterday’s apple slaw, rescued half of the veggies before adding apples and cider vinaigrette when I realised that’s way too much veggies. Added minced meat, corn, tomato paste and soy sauce for taste before burying everything under potatoes mashed with butter, milk and yoghurt (replaced the creme fraiche) #circuitbreakercooking #circuitbreakerday54 #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomeforsg
