As we #StayHomeForSG, let’s not forget the migrant workers and essential workers who are on the frontline keeping our country going during this difficult time.

Show our support, display our flags like how we do during National Day. I remember attending my first NDP where I witnessed the Chinook fly our flag against the magnificent skyline with the national anthem playing in the background. I was overwhelmed with emotions, walking down memory lane to realise how fortunate I am to be a Singaporean.

The flag is a symbol of strength and hope as the nation advances post covid-19. Continue to stand in solidarity and add a little positivity into the community. Be reminded that we are #HomeButNotAloneSG ❤️ #WeAreMajulah #SGUnited #sp
