Made tutu kueh from scratch today! For friends who haven't had this, it's a tiny steamed cake made of roasted rice flour flavoured with pandan, filled with a mixture of grated coconut and gula melaka, and served on little banana leaf squares.

It's a lot harder than it looks - I had some trouble getting the rice flour's consistency right and keeping the shape of the kueh. Will keep trying! This doesn't come close to the perfection of @tutukuehpapa's though! Uncle makes the best I've ever had. If you're in Singapore you need to try it⁣!! You also need to try putu piring - it's also made of rice flour, filled with sticky, delicious gula melaka and topped with shredded coconut.⁣ ⁣

On a mission to master all the kuihs. If you have any recipes you like, please share them with me! :)⁣
