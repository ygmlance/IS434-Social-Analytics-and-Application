We would like to thank Suhui Hee (@illodillo) and Charmaine (@fraunfraun) for creating such dynamic designs for #StayHomeStayLit for the month of April and May. It was really wonderful having you be a part of the campaign, and we’re really grateful to have had the opportunity to work with you both :) ⁣

⁣Look out for our next phase of #StayHomeStayLit2020 starting in June with a brand new look! In the meantime, do continue sharing your own responses to #SingLit using #StayHomeStayLit2020~⁣
