Falling in love with baking sourdough bread for my family during this CB period 🥰Baking sourdough needs patience as it takes a longer time. From mixing the dough with the starter, to fermentation and baking, it took 2 days to complete the process✌🏻I have been baking rustic sourdough bread, sourdough ciabatta and  sourdough baguette 🥖 Though the hours are long but it is all worthwhile 🥰 For my family to have home-baked sourdough bread 🥖 🍞
