This is the original name of the recipe but because I scaled down for 2 people, I only needed to use 10 🤭⁣
Cooked this for dinner yesterday and it's so good!! The chicken is tender, the garlic is soft and mushy like butter and the 𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘷𝘺 - super flavourful and looks like a cream sauce except there's no cream used! ⁣
⁣
My favourite way of eating is to smush the garlic on crusty bread, top with soft onion and some chicken, and drizzle shamelessly with plenty of gravy. ⁣
