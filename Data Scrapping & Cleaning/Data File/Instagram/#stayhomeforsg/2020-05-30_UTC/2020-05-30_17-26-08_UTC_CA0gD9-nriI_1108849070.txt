Missing HK dessert because of missing some friends 😉😉 so I read up, simplified and made 3 times to kill the cravings! Nothing is slow with me😂 due to personal patience limit😏 
Perfectly done! 5mins to prepare, 10mins to steam, refrigerated if for chilled dessert.
(*I am barred from cold food/drinks/dessert😔) 📑
All you need is 1 egg White, 1 tablespoon sugar, 100ml fresh milk, sieve and steamer/rice cooker.
If I can, you can 2,3! 😁👍
