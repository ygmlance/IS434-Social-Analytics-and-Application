After I é—­å…³ä¿®ç‚¼ for the past week or so...now I finally å‡ºå…³...and the first thing I feel like eating is MuaChee. Hahaha. Mouth itchy. I like mine with both peanut power & crushed peanuts, with sesame seeds. I will slightly warm up the crushed peanuts & sesame seeds on the stove n it will give u that amazing aroma. Soooo good.
