In light of the circuit breaker and the May School Holidays, Class 1T30 of Catholic Junior College has collaborated with SAMH Creative Services to promote mental wellness and encourage you to take care of your mental health during this period and beyond.

With the increased stress and uncertainty that may have arisen from the COVID-19 outbreak, social isolation can take an emotional toll on us. Look out for our IG stories for tips on how to stay engaged and connected with those you love and care about.
