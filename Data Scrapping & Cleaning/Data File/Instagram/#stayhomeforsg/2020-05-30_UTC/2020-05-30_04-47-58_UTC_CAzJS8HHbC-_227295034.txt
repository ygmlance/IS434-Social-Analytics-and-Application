Breakfast ☀️🍴 for myself 👩. Blueberry Almond Biscotti from @bakeandbake_singapore, Brownie, Frozen Blue Berries, Vanilla Yogurt & Weird Looking Stale Bun.⠀

When cooking 👩‍🍳 for myself, it's a very different story. As long as it's cooked, safe to eat, I'm ok 👌. Save the best for my little one 😘. I chop chop grab some ingredients from my magical fridge to put them together. Amazingly it tasted super nice 👍.⠀
