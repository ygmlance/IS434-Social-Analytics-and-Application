CB Day 54: 30th May 2020. Ninth takeaway during CB is from one of my favourite coffeeshops for some local delights that my parents havenâ€™t had for some time. Wuxiang from Lao Zhong Zhong, duck rice and satay beehoon. Shioks!! Tomorrow I might have to run 10km ðŸ˜‚ #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgfoodpics #foodpics #foodpic #whati8today #supportlocal #supportlocalbusiness #sgunited #circuitbreaker #lockdown #stayathome #strongtogether #stayhomeforsg #sgrestaurant #laozhongzhong #wuxiang #sataybeehoon #duckrice #localdelights #sghawker
