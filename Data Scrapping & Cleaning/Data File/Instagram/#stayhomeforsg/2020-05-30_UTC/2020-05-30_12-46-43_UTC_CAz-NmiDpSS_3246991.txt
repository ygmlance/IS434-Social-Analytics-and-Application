While we’re still celebrating Syawal, me and my friends in @altoaura whipped up something special for you guys. Who knew we could do this! Yes, this is our own original - composed by our talented mate @reyzahamizan - Some might have heard it but still wonder who’s the original singers? Nope it’s not by Syamel and Ernie, nor Tajul and Wany Hasrita, it’s US! Teehee! Shout out to @nasyibasahari - my original duet partner for this piece. Have a listen to this fresh and fun re-arrangement by our very own maestro @aidilakmal 🎹
