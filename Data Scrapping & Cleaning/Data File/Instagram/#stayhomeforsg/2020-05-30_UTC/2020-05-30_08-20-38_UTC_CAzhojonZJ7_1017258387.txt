CB Day 54 - Yes, I have pretty much stopped drinking, saving the alcohol quota only for special occasions. But my husband have not. And so he asked me to order these Soju.
He plans to save it for Christmas but I am sure he will start drinking them once we can invite friends over to our place. 🍶🍶 #CB #CBDay54 #CandJandJ #CandJandJ的家 #J的酒 #Soju #DrinkingTime #酒鬼FallIn #StayAtHome #StayHomeForSG #SGUnited
