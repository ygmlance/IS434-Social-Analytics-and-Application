This cream puff from @baristartcoffee_sg was heavenly! SWIPE LEFT to drool.

It is filled with Hokkaido BIEI Jersey Milk custard cream, and topped off with delectable crisps and sugary bits.

A decadent treat that was luscious but surprisingly not overwhelming.

I bought 3 for $12 from the branch at Tras Street.
