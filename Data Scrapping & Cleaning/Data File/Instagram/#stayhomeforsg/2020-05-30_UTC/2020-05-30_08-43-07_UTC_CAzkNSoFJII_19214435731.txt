Another baking activity with Leong mama today before the end of Circuit Breaker! Excited to make our very first No Knead Crusty Bread which we learnt from youtube videos! (Really no kneading required and you only need 3 basic ingredients; water, instant yeast and all-purpose flour!) 😁
Turned out soft and chewy in the inside but crispy on the outside. Taste great with just butter or cheese! 😍😋
