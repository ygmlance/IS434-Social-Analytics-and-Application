This Prawn Tanghoon recipe is an absolute flavour bomb! If you love coriander as much as I do, you will love this too. Never knew I could fry the coriander roots to get its maximum aroma, I will never throw away them roots ever again!

Am thinking I could substitute the prawns for other shellfish, perhaps crayfish, clams or even lobster tail? 🤔 
Thank you @heyrozz & @iamjaynedoe for this yumminess in my belly.
