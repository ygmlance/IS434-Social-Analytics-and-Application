Day 54 Circuit breaker dinner.
Tonight's porridge I added salmon and organic black Raisins. But after cooking the Raisins looks like peanuts in the photo. 😁
The rest are very common ingredients ( carrots,  tomatoes,  purple sweet potatoes).
Added Lee Wee Bros big Banana leaf Otar & Mid Joint Honey roasted chicken wing.
