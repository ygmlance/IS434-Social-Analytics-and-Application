Sweet and Sour Red Grouper
.
A classic at "zi char" restaurants (for my non-Singaporean followers, this is basically a restaurant that serves a wide selection of common and affordable dishes on their menu). The best part about this dish is the sauce on the crispy fish. The challenge is to eat this while the fish is still crispy!
.
I like to add some chillies to this dish for that extra "kick"ðŸ˜‹
