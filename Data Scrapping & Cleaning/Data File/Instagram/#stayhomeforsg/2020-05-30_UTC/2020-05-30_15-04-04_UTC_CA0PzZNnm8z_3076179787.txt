Has the interminable periods of thunderstorms and sunshine thrown you off balance? Immerse yourself in the carefully orchestrated intrigue of a good old fashioned mystery, compacted within Adeline Tan’s (@yell0w) mesmerising brush strokes inspired by Ovidia Yu’s (@ovidiayu) “The Frangipani Tree Mystery”.⁣
⁣ ⁣
⁣“The Frangipani Mystery has all the things I like in a story; suspense, outsider heroes,  heritage, with references to nature and its beasts. In the story there were mentions of native people being seen as animals, and colonial masters as hunters and collectors of trophy animals, with a backdrop of local flora.⁣
⁣ ⁣
⁣I made an image of the frangipani plant woven into the shape of a tiger skull. Like the animal skull it has an association with death in our culture, but for the governor and his family it was decorative, from the stuffed carcasses to the trees they kept in their gardens.”⁣
