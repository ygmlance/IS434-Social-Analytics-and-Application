Pret a manger dark chocolate chunk cookies with sea salt flakes. Crispy edges, gooey chocolatey centres. Addictively indulgent. Love the addition of sea salt flakes on top, #saltysweetcookie

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/make-your-own-pret-a-manger-cookie
Using @lindt #darkchocolate and #cornishseasalt 
Notes to recipe, my adaptation :
1) Reduced white sugar to 150g and brown sugar to 75g and cookies still sweet. Can reduce sugar further. 
2) Kept shaped cookie dough in fridge for 30 mins before baking.
3) I baked at 170 deg C instead of recipe's 180 deg C and for 12 mins. 
4) If you like your cookies to have crispy centres, bake for additional 2 mins.
