DAY 53 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
(countdown ... 3 days to go)
Chicken Bulgogi with Kimchi fried rice.

K is a way of life in this part of the world ... be it pop, or drama or food, or fashion. And my love for Asian cuisine has just grown over the past two decades. Korean is my choice after Chinese, when it comes to food.  And I have slowly started cooking more n more of Asian food at home. Today, I made Chicken Bulgogi for lunch, with kimchi fried rice.
** Will update the Chicken recipe soon.
As for the rice, I just fried some sliced onion, ginger & garlic paste in sesame oil, added store-bought kimchi and cooked rice. .
