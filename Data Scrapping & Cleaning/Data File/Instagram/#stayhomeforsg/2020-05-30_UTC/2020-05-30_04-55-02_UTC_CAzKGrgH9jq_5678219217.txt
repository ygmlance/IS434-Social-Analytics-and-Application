*Hobbies Organisation*
⠀
While practicing minimalism doesn’t mean you have to give up what you enjoy doing. Leading a simple life can be enjoyable too! Here is how I organised and store my things for my hobbies neatly in a corner of my home!
⠀
✔️[1st Drawer]
My Resin and Art items - All my resins craft, tools and materials are stored in there!
⠀
✔️[2nd Drawer]
Props for photo taking and festival home deco (Chinese New Year and Christmas)
⠀
✔️[3rd Drawer]
Photography equipment - studio lights, tripod etc
