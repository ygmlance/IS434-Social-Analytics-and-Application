This Rainbow cake is Aidenâ€™s and my first ever experience in baking a whole cake. We have been baking cookies, cupcakes, donut and we finally do a whole cake for Coen as he turns 6 months two days ago ðŸ¤— Itâ€™s a family get-together because papa helps on the second half of the baking.

The previous post was a video I made for Aiden baking the rainbow cake ðŸ˜‡
