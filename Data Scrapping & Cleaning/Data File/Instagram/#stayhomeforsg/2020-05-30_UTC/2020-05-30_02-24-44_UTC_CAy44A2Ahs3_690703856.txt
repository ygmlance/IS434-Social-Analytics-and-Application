When there’s no equipment, we do the best with what we have around our home🏡
.
Before you do this exercise, please check the surrounding, bedsheets and door for safety. If you don’t feel confident to do this, skip this exercise. Safety is priority🙏🏼
.
Make sure the door is stable and locked. You can also add 1 more knot on each bedsheet for extra safety✌🏼
.
I feel that I am maintaining my current physique and lean muscle mass because of all these home exercises. I thought it was impossible until I have been doing it for 2 months✌🏼
.
Keep moving, it might not be the same but doing something is better than nothing✌🏼
