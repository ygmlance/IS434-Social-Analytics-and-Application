30May2020 â™¡ Day 54 of SG Circuit Breaker Period - My first try of Brekkie w Scrambled Eggs, Sausage and Ham, and 1/3 Slab of BBQ St Louis Pork Ribs delivered to my doorstep from @brunchescafe. The brekkie set was great and good value. I was more surprised by the well-bbq-ed Ribs so succulent and juicy (swipe left). Hidden underneath the Ribs was the amazingly creamy mash potato. So yumz that I want to visit when we are done with dining at home! .
