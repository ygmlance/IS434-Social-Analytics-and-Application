Flashback to 25th April 2020:  I'm not a singer, but a radio presenter from ONE FM 91.3 in Singapore. So excuse my singing.  This is my first time letting anyone hear my singing online. A BIG thank you to our frontline and migrant workers, and to everyone who participated in this national effort to keep everyone's spirits up as we fight the spread of Covid-19 together. Thanks for sharing whatever video you have done through social media. 
P.S. Since, we're all practising social distancing and self-isolation, hug your pillow and imagine you're hugging your loved ones, friends and colleagues whom you haven't seen in a while. Hence, I chose to do this video in my bedroom.
P.S. Kudos to Dick Lee, the song's composer. "Home" has always been my fave national song. 
Hugs, Simon Lim :-)
