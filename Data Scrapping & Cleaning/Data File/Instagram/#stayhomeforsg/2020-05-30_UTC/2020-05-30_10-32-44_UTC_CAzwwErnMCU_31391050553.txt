🍪Snickerdoodle Cookies

my first ever official cookie that I’ve made.. and it failed.. 🥺 but I’ll challenge it again soon, gonna try baking oatmeal cookies too heh.

Never been a fan of cookies but snickerdoodle was always a cookie I wanted to bake, kinda sad that it didn’t turn out the way I wanted..😢
