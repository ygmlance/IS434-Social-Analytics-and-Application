Had #vegetarian #koreanfood for lunch today.  #doenjangjjigae #koreancurryrice #kimchijeon and 3 side dishes.

Although Deonjang Jjigae has a strong taste, I have grown to like the stinky taste and also because it is a healthy ingredient.  The fermented soy bean paste is rich in essential minerals and is a good source of various B vitamins, vitamins E, K and folic acid.  Fermented food provides the gut with beneficial bacteria that help us to stay healthy, vibrant and happy; good gut health is known to be linked to our overall mental and physical wellness.

This is the first time i see Korean Curry rice on the menu from a SG restaurant.  The curry taste is milder compared to Singapore curry.  What's unique about this is that the "cutlet" has been replaced by brinjal and it is an interesting addition to this curry rice dish.

Shout-out to my k-food friends to share what's on your dining table too! @kopikakii and @juliababywong
