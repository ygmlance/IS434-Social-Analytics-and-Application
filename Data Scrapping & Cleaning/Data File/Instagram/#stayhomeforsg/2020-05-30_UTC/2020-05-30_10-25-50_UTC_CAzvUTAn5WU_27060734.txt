The "circuit breaker" lockdown in Singapore without work as a video creator has been sobering for me as someone who works in the arts. However, with little distractions, it has become a quiet time of contemplation, and an opportunity to reflect about my identity. I am third-generation Hainanese, both my late paternal and maternal grandfathers were from Hainan island, in the southern part of China. .
The Hainanese population is the smallest in Singapore, at 7%. Beyond some of my generation who are able to speak some Hainanese inherited from our grandparents, the dialect is difficult to sustain because the it is largely orally passed down and not formally taught in school or in writing, which means it may be a forgotten language in Singapore as its importance diminishes. I've made this film as a remembrance of the pondering about my identity during quarantine.
.
For me, connecting with our roots in order to avoid feeling the sense of loss or displacement, especially in difficult times is been essential and important. I've found doing so beneficial, and I wanted to to take this opportunity from the commission to inspire others to do so as well, while at the same time promote the Hainanese language, bringing more awareness to it online while people are in quarantine at home and spending more time on the internet.
