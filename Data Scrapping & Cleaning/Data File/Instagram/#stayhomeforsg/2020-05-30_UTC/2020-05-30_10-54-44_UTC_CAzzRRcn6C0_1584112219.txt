Recipe for Steam Prawns:
Ingredients

100g vermicelli noodles
12 freshÂ prawns (abt 300g)
1 tablespoon cooking oil
4 tablespoons garlic (chopped)
2 tablespoons chilli (chopped)
2 tablespoons light soy sauceÂ 
1 tablespoon fish sauceÂ 
1 tablespoon Chinese huaÂ tiao wine
4 tablespoon water
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon white pepper

Cooking steps

Soak vermicelli noodles in water for about 10 minutes until softened. Use a pair of scissors to cut into 2 to 3 sections. Drain out. 
Rinse prawns and pat dry with kitchen towels. Use a pair of scissors to trim off the rostrum and legs. Cut the shells along its back. Then use a knife to make an incision by cutting the flesh about three-quarters of the way into prawn flesh, from the head to nearly all the way down to the tail. Remove the vein. Open the flesh and slightly press to flatten. Set aside.

Fry garlic and chilli in oil over a medium heat until garlic turn lightlyÂ brown. Transfer to a small bowl. Add soy sauce, fish sauce,Â chinese wine, water, white pepper, sugar and salt, then mix well.

Place vermicelli noodles on a plate with prawns on top in one layer

Spoon the sauce with garlic onto eachÂ prawns. Then place the plate into a steamer filled with water. Bring the water to a boil. Then leave to steam over a low heat for abt 7-8 minutes.

Garnish with spring onion
