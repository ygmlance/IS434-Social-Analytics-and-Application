Are we gonna go out soon? ðŸ¤© It seems like we had some news that Singapore has decided to probably open its retail earlier and allow dine in. We hope that if that is allowed, everyone will still practise safety distancing and being socially responsible by wearing mask and keeping your hands clean to protect yourself and the people around you!
Spottie cannot wait! ðŸ’ž
