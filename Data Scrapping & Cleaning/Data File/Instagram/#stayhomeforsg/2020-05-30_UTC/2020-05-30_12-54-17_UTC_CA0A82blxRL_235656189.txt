It’s never to late to start exercising, but the earlier the better. Slow and steady wins the race. Believe in yourself, you are better than you think you are, so start moving. Every run, I am reminded to endure and to be patience. Its my own race. I enjoyed my journey during my run. #sgunited #ccbsg #stayhomeforsg #dontgiveup #run #zumbafitness #zumba #nike #todayseffortistomorrowsresult #firststepisthehardest #tyj #跑了就懂 #avemarie  #sgrunners
