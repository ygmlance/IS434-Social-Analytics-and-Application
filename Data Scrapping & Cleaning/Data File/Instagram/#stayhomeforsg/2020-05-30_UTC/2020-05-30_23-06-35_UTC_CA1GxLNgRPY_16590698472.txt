Original : 'Great Is Thy Faithfulness' Thomas O. Chisholm, 1923⁣
Remake : 'He's Always Been Faithful', Sara Groves, 2017⁣
⁣
This has been quite a project. In the words of Rod Stewart - 'It's been a long road, getting from there to here'. ⁣
⁣
60 videos, 6 collabs, newfound tech skills, revisiting old passions; what an eventful couple of months it's been. The irony is it was supposed to be a quiet time of...staying home. But I got through it - with a little help from my friends, my fingers, and my faith. I don't know if it's sustainable - maybe a less intense schedule, maybe less ambitious videos - but those are dilemmas for another day. ⁣
⁣
Morning by morning I wake up to find⁣
The power and comfort of God's hand in mine⁣
Season by season I watch Him, amazed⁣
In awe of the mystery of His perfect ways⁣
All I have need of, His hand will provide⁣
He's always been faithful to me.⁣
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.⁣

The original and remake blend so seamlessly I decided not to disrupt the flow by highlighting the remake. You can still tell where one ends and the other begins, of course, but they really do go beautifully together. Fittingly, like the first, this final video for the circuit breaker is just the piano. ⁣
