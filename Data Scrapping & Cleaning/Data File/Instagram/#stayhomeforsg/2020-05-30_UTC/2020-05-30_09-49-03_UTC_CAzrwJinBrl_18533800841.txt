Only a Disney Song Workout can make me do jumping lunges without cursing! 🤣 I had so much FUN dancing (actually, HIIT HOP-ing) to some of my favourite Disney songs. It's super effective too as I was almost out of breath at the end of each song! 🥵
.
I'm sorry that this is not a workout tutorial but more like sharing my new workout explore with you. I CANNOT DANCE as you probably tell from the snippets 🤦🏻‍♀️ but I really enjoyed this Disney HIIT HOP workout with @emkfit and @_thatdisgirl ❤️
.
You can find the full workout video on YouTube by searching "Disney HIIT HOP". Don't be intimidated! If I can dance (if you can call that dancing), you can too! It's ok if we look like a fool when doing this cos it's all about the fun grooves and we're at home anyway right? 🤣
.
Any Disney fan here? Tell me your favourite Disney song! I love Hercules' Zero to Hero 🙌
