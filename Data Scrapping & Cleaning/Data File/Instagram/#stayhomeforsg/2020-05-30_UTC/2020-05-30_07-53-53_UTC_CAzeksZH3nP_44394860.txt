#throwback to a little sweet treat for the weekend 😍🤩 It’s Homemade Strawberry Custard Tart!! 🏡🍓🥧 I used a short crust pastry for the base and a creamy sweet custard for the filling. Took a while for the custard to curd and I was getting a bit worried since it’s my first attempt at making it 😅😅. Who’s a fan of the custard AND berries?! 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ #homebaker #food #foodie #homemade #foodblogger #foodporn #foodstagram  #homemadefood #circuitbreaker #sgbaker #baking #sgbake #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodtrend  #sgfooddiary #sgfoodlover  #bakeoftheday #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #quarantinebaking
