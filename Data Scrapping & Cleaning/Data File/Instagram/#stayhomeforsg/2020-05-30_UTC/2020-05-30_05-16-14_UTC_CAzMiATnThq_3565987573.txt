Guess what I cooked for #lunch this #Saturday ? I took 3 of my #truffle infused #eggs and cooked some ultra creamy #scrambledeggs and topped it with shavings of #summertruffle from Italy ! There was a subtle truffle fragrance permeating through the scrambled eggs which were further enhanced with the shavings of truffle! Had this #indulgent #lush and #moreish dish with some lightly-toasted #sourdough . Simply #heavenly ! #saturdayvibes #stayhome #sgunited
