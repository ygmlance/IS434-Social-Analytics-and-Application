Using my fav 🍞#breadmaker  #kenwood250 recipe to make these buns. Love the 💕soft and slightly chewy texture. Edit 📹video from previous post to include shaping to final bake. Watch it in my 🎞IGTV and hope it is helpful.🌻💓 Ingredients:
1 egg 
100g fresh milk 
100g whipping cream
40g caster sugar
4g salt
270g bread flour
30g cake flour (or plain flour)
15g milk powder
5g instant yeast

For my BM #kenwood, ingredients are put in above order. Select 'pasta dough' which will knead for 14mins. Once completed, select 'dough' mode and leave BM to knead plus 1st proofing (1.5hrs). Prepare toppings:

Condensed Milk Butter Topping (idea from @goh_ngaileng)

20g salted butter (soften)
6g condensed milk 
Upon 1st proofing 
Divide dough into 16pcs and shape.

Proof for another hour
Split dough with scissors and pipe toppings of your choice. 
Bake at preheated oven 180C for 20 to 25mins or till browned.
