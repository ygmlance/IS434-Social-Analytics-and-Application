12 pm tip for everyone! ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
A lot of people know I like drinking tea. ⁠⠀
This habit came about since the age of 18 where I realized I'm alcohol-intolerance. So when I party / hang out with others often is I will order a pot of tea + sip to try out the exotic drink others had to order. ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Over the years, I've also picked up many tips on drinking tea. So here they are:⁠⠀
1) Good to drink tea 30 - 45 minutes after a meal. The type of tea depending on your body condition/what you eat. ⁠⠀
2) Don't reuse the tea - #mamaong will make my tea in the morning during breakfast and placed the tea in my handly Starbucks large insulated tumbler and I will only drink after lunch cause I got to say even I kept the lid open, the tea still remains hot⁠⠀
3)Tea is not a substitute for water intake.  The recommended 8 huge glasses of water daily are still required for the body and teas are just add on to water intake. ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐓𝐞𝐚 is often ideal and especially after having BBQ / fried food. ⁠⠀
𝐏𝐞𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐓𝐞𝐚 is ideal when you eat too much ⁠⠀
𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐓𝐞𝐚 is ideal for tea time (around 3-4pm)⁠⠀
𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐚 is good after dinner (late)/2hrs before bed/ on stressful days as it has calming and relaxing benefits. ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
If you want any tea recommendation do let me know(:⁠⠀
