Thank you @yourgeylangserai and @yokezofficial for having me tonight! I really had fun, though I started off forgetting how to use my iPad cuz long time never gig. ðŸ˜… Made me realise how much I miss gigging too! Hope everything will be ok soon and we can perform for you guys again in the near future, like how we used too! Meanwhile stay safe at home!! Geylang Serai CC's FB page also has lots of things that can occupy you! Do check them out!!ðŸ˜Š
