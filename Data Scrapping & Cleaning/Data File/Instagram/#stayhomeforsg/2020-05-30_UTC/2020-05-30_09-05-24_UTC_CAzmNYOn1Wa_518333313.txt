🎥 Watch Kairi Rosli (DTP 2013) blazing through his stay home activity. 🤩⁠
⁠
📖 Here is Kairi’s story:⁠
Ever since the #CircuitBreaker, Kairi has been learning how to skip. Today, after about 2-3 months he is doing speed skipping. He started from barely zero and now he skips 174 times in one minute. His next target is to achieve 200 skips per minute.⁠
⁠
Amazing stuff Kairi! 👏👏👏 We hope you reach your target soon! We'd also like to thank Kairi's father for sharing with us his son's development at home in this Circuit Breaker period. 💙❤️⁠
