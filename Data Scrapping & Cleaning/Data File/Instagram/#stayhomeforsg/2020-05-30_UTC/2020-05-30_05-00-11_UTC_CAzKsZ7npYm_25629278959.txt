HCSA x kayo
We are so excited to announce to you guys that we will be collaborating with HCSA Dayspring SPIN to raise funds to support single parent families amid Covid-19! Many of them have lost their income due to the pandemic and may struggle to cope with a new normal.

For the month of June, 100% of the proceeds will be going to HCSA Dayspring SPIN!

In light of this, we will be launching a new collection every Monday at 9pm in June, with our first collection on the 1st.

Come and join us to play a part in giving back to the community. Make a difference with every handcrafted piece you purchase. A little help goes a long way!
