𝘛𝘰𝘧𝘶 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘥 𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘩𝘪𝘺𝘢𝘮𝘶𝘨𝘪 It’s a combination of my mama’s dish and my impromptu testing of ‘Nagoya Kisimentei Kiwawi Somen’ from NTUC. This Japanese noodle is QQ (springy)😋 and it goes well with sauces without turning soggy. It's traditionally meant to be eaten chilled and dipped in soy sauce. IT’S A GOOD BUY WOR!!! $2 for 270g and it comes in a variety of thickness. ⁣
