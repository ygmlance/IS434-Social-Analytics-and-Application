3 more days before CB is lifted. The boys are going back to school soon. I’m really glad. Honestly, too many distractions at home and it’s almost impossible to follow routine that ideally plan. 🤣 Kudos to those children that are homeschooled... high endurance and discipline. Definitely not at our home. 😝 My boys learn better in school. 😁 .

Today attempted chocolate #rollcake. I was using chiffon cake recipe instead of sponge cake. The cake is really really soft and fluffy. So soft that Joel can stuff one slice into his mouth at one shot! Compare to sponge cake, I feel that Chiffon cake is easier to roll and it won’t crack easily. Previously I tried using sponge cake recipe, it cracked and I couldn’t roll, ended up I broke the cake into piece and put cream on it instead. After I rolled, I put in the fridge to set the shape before I spread the cream on it. However, didn’t do well for the whipping cream though. 😞😞Think I’m too anxious to get it done, I didn’t freeze the chocolate cream Long enough before beating. Hence the whipping cream wasn’t stiff enough and kinda runny. .

Overall, it’s a good experience. Prefer to just bake chiffon cake, easier and took me less than hour to prep and bake the cake. 😅😅 #chiffoncake #chocolaterollcake #circuitbreakerbakingchallenge #stayhomeforsg
