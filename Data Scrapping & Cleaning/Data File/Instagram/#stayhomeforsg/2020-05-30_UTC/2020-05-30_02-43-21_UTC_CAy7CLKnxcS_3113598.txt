After trying out Little Bodies skin care on Jacey for three days...

𝚂𝚔𝚒𝚗 𝚁𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚎𝚏 𝚆𝚊𝚜𝚑 & 𝚂𝚑𝚊𝚖𝚙𝚘𝚘 is a gentle formula that is soap-free and non-irritating. This 2-in-1 wash not only cleanses the skin and scalp, it also helps to manage dry and itchy skin. Designed specifically for babies and young children with sensitive skin.

Skin Relief Wash & Shampoo is great as it makes bathing Jacey so much more convenient for me. It has a light and natural fragrance which I like, and her skin feels smooth and fresh after bath.

𝚂𝚔𝚒𝚗 𝚁𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚎𝚏 𝙼𝚘𝚒𝚜𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚒𝚜𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝙻𝚘𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗 is formulated with natural ingredients to maintain the natural moisture of skin. It also alleviates discomfort caused by itchy skin.

𝚂𝚔𝚒𝚗 𝚁𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚎𝚏 𝙲𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚖 is designed to relieve symptoms of itching and dryness. It also calms and soothes troubled skin, specifically for children.

Jacey sleeps in an air-conditioned room every night. So even though she doesn’t suffer from eczema, her skin may feel a little dry at times. Both Skin Relief Moisturising Lotion and Skin Relief Cream are non-greasy and do not have a strong smell. The lotion and the cream also absorb quickly, keeping her skin hydrated and moisturised through out the night.
