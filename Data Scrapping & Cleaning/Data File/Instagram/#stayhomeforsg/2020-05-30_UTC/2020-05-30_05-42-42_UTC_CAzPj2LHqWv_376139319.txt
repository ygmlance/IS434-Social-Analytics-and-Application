Today is National Scone Day!

I am always experimenting new food combinations.  I like scones to go with soup and i like Korean food.  How do you think of this fusion mix of Korean Pumpkin Soup with scones, and Korean Cinnamon tea?

To my vegetarians friends, #CherylScones makes egg-free and vegetarian-friendly scones.  Do check out her shop!  What i have on the plate are classic scone, avocado scone and organic fig jam!
