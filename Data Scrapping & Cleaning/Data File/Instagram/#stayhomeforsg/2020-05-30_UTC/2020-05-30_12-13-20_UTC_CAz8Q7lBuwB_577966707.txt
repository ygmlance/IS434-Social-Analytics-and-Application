Well-stretched pro athlete muscles? Day 13 of 21 - Football Flexibility with F17's Coach Irna

Muscular flexibilities will often result in less footballing injuries. Male and female athletes both spend time on stretching and some even use yoga and pilates. While these exercises may not be the highlight of their training, all footballers devote time to these stretches.
