I felt like yesterday was the day I failed as a mother after being with my toddler @ash1eigh_ng 24/7 for 52 days during this #circuitbreaker period. I’ve been scolding her every single day but yesterday, I scolded and screamed and let out a tirade of verbal abuse at her and broke down twice.

Kids being kids, they don’t take all these hard feelings to heart for too long. This picture shows how she patted my hand when I hugged her as we sat on the sofa to watch tv together.

Swipe for more elaboration or view them on my IG stories. Will get to DMs soon.
