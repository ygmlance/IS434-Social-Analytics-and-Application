The Very Busy Spider .
. 
Practicing our #finemotorskills today, spinning a web for a hungry spider. We rounded off by reading one of our favourites, The Very Busy Spider. .
.
The Very Busy Spider by Eric Carle @officialericcarle, one of the best-known and loved of picture book creators. It is about a dedicated spider who spends all day spinning her web and other barnyard animals who try to invite her to do other things. An inspirational story about hard work finally pays off.
