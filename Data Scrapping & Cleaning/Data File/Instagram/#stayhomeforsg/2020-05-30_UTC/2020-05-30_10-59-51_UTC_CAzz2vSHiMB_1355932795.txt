👏🏼 Congratulations to the 94 couples who have tied the knot since the start of video-link solemnizations! 👩‍❤️‍👨 My colleague, SPS Dr Faishal Ibrahim, also joined two of the solemnization sessions to congratulate the couples. 🌹 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused anxiety to some couples who are planning to marry this year. I am glad that we can now offer them this option to solemnize their marriages through video-link. #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #StayHomeforSG
