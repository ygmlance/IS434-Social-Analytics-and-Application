Here's something about me. 
Everyone will experience change some point of time in your life. My change is associated with food and it's SPICY FOOD! 🌶
Since young, i've never appreciate spicy food as it makes my mouth, lips, tongue and throat suffer. Basically everything burns! Worst of all, breaking out in perspiration. 🤭
Things took a turn recently, and unconsciously i start taking spicy food, definitely increasing spiciness level gradually and not rocket from 0 to 100 within days or weeks. 😜
So i had TOM YUM noodles today! 😋😆😄
Still trying to appreciate it by the days. 
Let me know your favourite spicy food below. Perhaps i'll try it out someday. 😆😆😆
Take care folks! 👍🏻
