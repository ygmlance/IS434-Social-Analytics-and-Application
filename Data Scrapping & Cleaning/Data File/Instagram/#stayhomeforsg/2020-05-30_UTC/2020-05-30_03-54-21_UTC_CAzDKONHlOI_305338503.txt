Save the earth Saturdays 
Gentle reminder to (1st) Reduce, (2nd) Reuse and (3rd) Recycle! 
Pulau semakau has very limited space left. Every household must play your part.

Just compare my waste bin (on the left) to the recyclables beside me (Top - Paper, 2nd - Plastics, 3rd - Metal & Bottom - Glass). So much of space would have been taken up in the refuse chute if I didnt recycle! I have 1 more bin along the corridor for my organic matter for composting.

You actually dont have to sort your recyclables. Just make sure they are clean, dry and free of food. 
I only clear my waste daily in the chute and my recyclables weekly into the recycling bin below my block.

Let's do our part for the environment.
