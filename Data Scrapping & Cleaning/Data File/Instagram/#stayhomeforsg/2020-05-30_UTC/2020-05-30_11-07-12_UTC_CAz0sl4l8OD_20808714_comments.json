It actually makes sense because they are too young to know how to handle difficult feelings and how to console someone else. Think about it...some adults are not even good at consoling others or saying the right things when others are upset so much less our 2yo. But I feel u.. this cb is not easy for any of us, much less for solo parenting moms who have no help and have to juggle working from home too! Breaking down is normal.. talk to someone. Also luckily very soon pre schools are opening and we are allowed visitors once again. Take care Jolene!\ud83d\ude0d sending u love!",

The patching back is so important. \ud83d\udc97I always patch back with her very fast coz sometimes even as I feel really shiok scolding her, my heart feels pain when she looks so pitiful. \ud83d\udc94Yes. She usually changes topic so I was very surprised at her behaviour in the evening. It\u2019s like so cute and endearing following me about and sitting beside me. Like those kinda friend who does not talk and silently supports you. I really can\u2019t wait for school to reopen! Can\u2019t wait to pack her away to school so that she could eat properly due to teachers and peer pressure and be more disciplined. This CB really bo zeng hu after a while. Coz if control too much, I\u2019ll feel more exasperated when things don\u2019t go as planned. \u263a\ufe0f",
