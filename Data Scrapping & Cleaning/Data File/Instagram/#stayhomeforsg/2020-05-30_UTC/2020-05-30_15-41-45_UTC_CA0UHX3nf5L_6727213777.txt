Observed these silent #frontliners going about their daily job, churning out order after order while adhering to safe distancing measures by staying apart from each other and minimizing contact with fellow colleagues. Mad respect for the people who have had to work doubly hard just to deal with these massive changes and inconveniences caused by #covid19 ✊🏼 also not forgetting our precious #healthcareworkers aka #healthcareheroes; food delivery heroes from #grabfood #foodpanda #deliveroosg, and more 🙌🏼 it’s been a tough year for us all but let’s do our best to help one another out, and above all, stay kind to each other and hope for this to pass soon. ✨
