Practice Safe distancing on public transport and remember to wear a mask. A new norm to commute nowadays

In line with the implementation of the Multi-Ministry Taskforceâ€™s elevated set of safe distancing measures from 7 April 2020, the Land Transport Authority will implement the additional safe distancing measures in the public transport network. 
All trains and train stations, as well as buses, bus interchanges and bus stops will be progressively marked with safe distancing stickers. Standing spaces and seats that should be avoided will be marked out with green and orange stickers. Commuters should adhere to the spaces that are demarcated, to maintain safe distances from others when commuting.
