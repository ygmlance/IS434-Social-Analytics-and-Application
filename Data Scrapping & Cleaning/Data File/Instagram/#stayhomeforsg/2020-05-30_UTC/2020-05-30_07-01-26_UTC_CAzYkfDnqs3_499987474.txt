RECREATING ASIAN TV CHARACTERS! ðŸ“º .
Thank you to everyone who volunteered your favourite TV characters played by Asians! It was really interesting to explore TV shows I donâ€™t watch and to find out how Asians are represented in TV from different eras, languages, genres, and platforms.
.
This challenge was borne out of a desire to dress up as my favourite TV characters but I soon felt a bit hollow dressing up as characters who didnâ€™t reflect what I looked like. Iâ€™m so happy to learn that Asian representation is growing in mainstream media in various genres!

A moment of silence for the characters I wanted to dress up as but didnâ€™t have the clothes to do so ðŸ˜¢
