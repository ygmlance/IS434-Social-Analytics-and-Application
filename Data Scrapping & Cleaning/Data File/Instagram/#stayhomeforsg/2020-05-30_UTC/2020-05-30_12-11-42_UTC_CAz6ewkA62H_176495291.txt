Coen turned 6 months a couple of days ago and we made him a rainbow cake! 
Aiden is so excited when I told him the idea and we baked for two hours given the various layers baking. The process was longer than the usual baking and Aiden patiently bakes step by step. 
This is one of Montessori well loved activity. It involves lots of practicing motoric skill here. 
The recipe we use is from Diva Baking - https://divascancook.com/easy-rainbow-cake-recipe-from-scratch/
