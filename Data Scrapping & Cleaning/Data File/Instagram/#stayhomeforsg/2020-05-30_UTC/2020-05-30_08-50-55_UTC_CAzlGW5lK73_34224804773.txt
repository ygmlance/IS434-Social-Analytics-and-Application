17 May 2020: You're the gula melaka to my ondeh ondeh. @quandaong 💚🤎💚🤎
.
My nonya roots denies me of the remote possibility of not liking ondeh ondeh. How can anyone dislike this? Soft chewy pillowy balls filled with explosive melty and oozy Melakan palm sugar.
.
I used sweet potatoes - a mix between the orange Australian ones and the Japanese ones for some additional sweetness. 💚🤎
