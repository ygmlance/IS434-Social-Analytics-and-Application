As much as my boys like, I always try to be creative with the food I make for my kids! The challenge this round is to #CooktheDifferencewithMAGGI 🍝💕✨✨ ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Doing a twist to the normal pizza, I made them into bite size shapes of different characters 🤣 Can you recognize them? 🤣🤣🤣 ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Here’s how to do this 📝, ⁣⁣
Cooking MAGGI noodles the way we always do, pour the soup away, beat an egg inside and mix it together with the noodle. Put the noodles into the characters mould, cling wrap it and fridge it for at least 15mins. While waiting, prepare the ingredients for the pizza 🍕 ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
⁣⁣
After 1 hour, remove the MAGGI noodles from the mould and spread pasta sauce on it, top it up with ham, corn and lots of cheese 🧀. Preheat oven to 180 degrees and bake for 🔟 mins. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Happiness is homemade because the moment I take it from the oven, the boys are busy choosing which characters they want to “gobble” them up 🤣🤣🤣✨✨✨⁣
