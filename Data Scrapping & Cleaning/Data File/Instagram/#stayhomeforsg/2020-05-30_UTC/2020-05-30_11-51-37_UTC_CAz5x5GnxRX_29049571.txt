Beef Wellington. A dish that’s always been in my cooking bucket list. The recipe and preparation can be daunting, which is why I’ve never really attempted it before CB kicked in. I’m glad I finally tried it and it is definitely a dish that can wow friends and family. 
Do you have a cooking bucket list? I have a long list and I can finally “check off” Beef Wellington✅
