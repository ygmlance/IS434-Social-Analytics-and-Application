ART PROMPT

Hand gestures mean a thousand words. Are your hands tightly clenched or wide open during this season? ✊🏽🙌🏽👋🏽🤲🏽 Draw an outline of your 2 hands:

On the outline of your left hand, think of things that are not within your control and that you’ll like to let go of during this period. Sketch or write them down.

On the outline of your right, think of things that you treasure dearly and that you’ll like to hold on to during this period. Sketch or write them down.

Share your reflections with your trusted ones, or post on your social media and tag us @samhealthcreatives.
