《Support Local Businesses》
During this Covid-19 period, let us support our local businesses. I ordered tins of biscuits at @sgmunchmunch for my colleagues, friends and love ones. At a very affordable price of $30, I get 10 packets ($2 each) of Assorted Old Skool Biscuits in a Tin ($5) with delivery ($5) - not far end of SG. If you want, simply add $10-$20 to get items like sweets and toys to put into the same tin for kids. It is a good surprise and practical gift to many! Pm Ken Kish for pre-order and information.
