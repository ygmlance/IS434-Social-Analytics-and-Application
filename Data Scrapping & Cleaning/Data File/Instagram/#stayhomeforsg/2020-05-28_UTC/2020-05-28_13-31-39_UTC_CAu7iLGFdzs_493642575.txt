I have always been a huge fan of Korean Food from Kbbq to Tteokbokki to various stews, etc. Since Circuit Breaker started, I have tried to recreate some of my favorite Korean dishes at home.

Bibimbap has always been one of my favorite Korean dish. The variety of vegetables make me feel like I can get all my vitamins and fibre from this meal. I also like the different textures from the various ingredients in the bowl.
