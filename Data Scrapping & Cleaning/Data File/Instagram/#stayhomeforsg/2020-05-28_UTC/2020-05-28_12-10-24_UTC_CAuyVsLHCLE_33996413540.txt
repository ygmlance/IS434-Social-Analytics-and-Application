Which scale are you using to measure happiness? ⏲⁣
⁣
Don’t trick yourself into thinking that you’ll only “be happy” when you get your next promotion or buy that dream car. That ‘happiness’ will fizzle out soon enough and you’ll be left with disappointment and discontentment all over again. ⁣

⚡️ NEWSFLASH: YOU CAN BE HAPPY RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW WITH WHATEVER YOU HAVE ⚡️
