How about a nice hot cup of aromatic coffee for a mid-day pick-up-me? ⁣

Did you know the coffee we use at @ginettsingapore is sustainable? Sustainable coffee is grown in a way that isn't harmful to nature and provides a better livelihood for the people who process it.⁣

We are grateful for the daily dose of liquid gold we get for our mid-day boost. What are you grateful for recently?⁣
