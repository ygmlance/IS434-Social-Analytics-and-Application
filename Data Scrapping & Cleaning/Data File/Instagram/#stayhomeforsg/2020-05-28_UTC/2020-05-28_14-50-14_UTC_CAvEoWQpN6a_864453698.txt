Hai Chi Jia Suan La Fen 嗨吃家酸辣粉 is an instant mala noodles snack that is currently taking Singapore by storm!

I decided to check out this trending snack for myself and I’ve got to say it was definitely worth the hype.

The mala broth was numbingly-spicy, savoury, vinegary, and extremely addictive. The vermicelli noodles were bouncy and chewy with just the right amount of bite.

It was so satisfying to slurp up the noodles which had absorbed all the goodness of the broth!

The noodles is Halal so Muslims can enjoy this great snack too.
