These 7 single-parent families (and 20 more) can enjoy freshly-cooked meals delivered to their homes, thanks to @advo.asia and the donors of their #FeedaFam campaign ðŸ˜‹
.
This comes as a blessing especially to the single parents who lost their jobs or have to take unpaid leave to care for their children at home amid the extended circuit breaker period. Starting from the special meal delivery on Mother's Day earlier this month, Advo Asia will continue to provide our members of HCSA Dayspring SPIN with daily dinners till 1 June.
.
Together with our members, we express our heartfelt appreciation to Advo and their donors for bringing cheer during this challenging period for some! ðŸ’›
