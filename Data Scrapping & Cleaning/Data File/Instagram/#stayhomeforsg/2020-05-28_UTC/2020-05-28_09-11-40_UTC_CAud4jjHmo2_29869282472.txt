2️⃣After it is cooled down, add in one egg and scallop powder into it.⁣

3️⃣Divide the egg-dressed noodles into two portions, and place each half into a ramekin. Cover the noodles with plastic wrap, and weigh it down with a bowl to compress it into a bun shape. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.⁣
