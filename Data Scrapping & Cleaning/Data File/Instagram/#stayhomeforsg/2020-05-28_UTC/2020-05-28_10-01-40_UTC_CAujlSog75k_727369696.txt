"It is not because you are not motivated, it is because something stops you." Coach Karen.

In this episode, I touch on a sensitive topic. It is something that we are all guilty of in some way or another. Some of us procrastinate and some of us plow through it. Is exercising a chore or venture? 
In this episode, I address 5 common excuses that prevent individuals from exercising and hear if any excuse resonate with you.

1. "I don't have time to exercise."
2. "I have so much to do. Exercise can wait."
3. "I have negative past experiences. My classmates laughed at me when I did jumping jacks."
4. "I don't need exercise. I can just lose weight from eating healthily."
5. "I am not motivated enough or I am not disciplined enough. I need someone to push me." Does any of the excuses resonate with you? If so, you are definitely not alone.
