Day #52/56 of #CovidCircuitBreaker: A #ForearmStand #AirHeart ❤️ for @youthcreatessg Air Hug Challenge. I thought I’ll take a break from working out today cos it’s my birthday. This worked me so hard. Thanks for doing this with me & motivating me in my #pincha journey @chantelecp ! 🙏🏻 I miss socialising with random people at the gym. Just when I made friends and could hang out for baos & wine...🍷#yoga #pinchamayurasana #pinchaplay #stayhome #stayhomeforsg #stayhomeforsgchallenge #sgunited #singaporetogether #staysafe #circuitbreaker
