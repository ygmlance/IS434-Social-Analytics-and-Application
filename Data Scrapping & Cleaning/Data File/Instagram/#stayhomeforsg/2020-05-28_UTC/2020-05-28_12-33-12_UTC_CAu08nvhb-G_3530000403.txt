One MAGGI noodles pizza, please!
We were meant to be in Italy this Mayâ€¦ and I was missing my Italian holiday and food so much that Charles whipped up a pizza made out of @maggi_sg Chicken Flavour Noodles. I wasnâ€™t expecting much but I was really surprised by how good it tastes. Sharing the simple steps below so you can try it out too ðŸ™‚ 
Step 1: Boil MAGGI noodles for 2mins
Step 2: Drain water and mix noodles with raw egg
Step 3: Flatten noodles and pan fry both sides of noodles 
Step 4: Add toppings (we used Taiwan sausage, cheese and basil leaves)
Step 5: Place in oven at 180 degrees for 5 mins
