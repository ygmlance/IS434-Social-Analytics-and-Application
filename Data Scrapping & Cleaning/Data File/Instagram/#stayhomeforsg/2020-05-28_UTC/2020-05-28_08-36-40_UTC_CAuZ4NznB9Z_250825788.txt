We had crossed the mark on the last week of the Circuit Breaker with Cardio HIIT and we had a sharing / chit-chat session after the workout.

What is the 1st thing I want to do after Circuit Breaker?
My answer: Head back to the gym and lift heavy weights! Sick and tired lifting baby dumbbells at home. But I have to wait for after Phase 1 of Post Circuit Breaker.
