“The circuit breaker period was... truly a forced-downtime (as a good friend of mine once said) for me and for many peers. I don’t remember the last time I stayed home completely for even 3 days consecutively. The past few years were especially filled with many activities out of home, even late into the nights. Needless to say, I faced difficulties adjusting to working from home, socialising with family and friends, finding new ways to keep fit (and sane) indoors; I was shocked at how difficult these were for me. I came across this view during one of my exercise sessions and somehow, this new perspective made me feel thankful and grounded despite the uncertainties of the future—that there are still new things to be discovered, and there’s still a lot more to life than what I had thought, even when I thought I was just finally figuring life out.”
