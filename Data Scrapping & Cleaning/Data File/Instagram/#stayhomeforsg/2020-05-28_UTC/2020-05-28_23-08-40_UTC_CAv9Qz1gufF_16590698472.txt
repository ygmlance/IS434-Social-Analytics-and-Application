Original : 'Crown Him With Many Crowns', Matthew Bridges, 1851 ⁣
Remake : 'Crown Him (Majesty)', Chris Tomlin, 2013⁣
⁣
Woo-hoo, another Chris Tomlin; hand on heart, it wasn't planned.⁣
⁣
In this remake, Tomlin adds not one, but two sections, and with these, what begins as already a behemoth of a hymn just becomes a colossal piece of vocal music. Take a moment to go through the original yourself - it is quite hefty on its own. The remake could end after the first new section ('Majesty, Lord of all'), but Tomlin pushes on, and we're swept along to the final 'All hail Redeemer, hail'. ⁣
⁣
Tomlin is on record that he's 'wanted to reclaim the hymn for a long time for the younger generations.' The singer added that when he is teaching songwriting classes, he always brings the second line of the hymn up, "Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own." Tomlin explains : "It just cannot be written any better than that. When I think about what we're doing as worship leaders, when we're bringing a song of praise, a heavenly anthem of praise, it drowns out all music and drowns out all other noise ... That's why there's so much peace when people come to sing; God drowns out every other competing thing."⁣
⁣
The future of communal singing, and indeed, corporate worship, is up in the air. If a song is written and nobody sings it is it still a song? If a worship song isn't sung does worship still happen? ⁣
⁣
Majesty, Lord of all⁣
Let every throne before Him fall⁣
The King of kings, O come adore⁣
Our God who reigns forevermore⁣
⁣
All hail, Redeemer, hail⁣
For Thou has died for me⁣
His praise and glory shall not fail⁣
Throughout eternity⁣
