The good news is you can SKIP a full body workout if you do two rounds of this because this leg workout can double up as cardio! 🤩
.
In fact, squats and lunges are "compound" exercises that use more than one joint and many muscles (more than "isolation" exercises), which also means more CALORIES burned! So if you're looking to lose weight, try including more compound exercises cos they are very effective fat burners! 🔥
.
I'd still recommend doing a proper warm up or a 5-min activation before this leg workout to avoid injury and to maximize the burn! Another suggestion is to use two hands for 1-Leg Deadlift for better stability! I almost fell off 😂
.
If you want a NO JUMPING version, simply do the following changes:
◽ High Knee 👉 Knee Pull Up
◽ Scissor Squat 👉 Reverse Lunge
◽ Squat to Jump Squat 👉 Normal Squat
.
So... no excuse today, make yourself a PRIORITY and WORTHY of everything you want! ❤️
.
p.s. Believe me I hate Jump Squats but I can't deny that they are so effective for working the legs and pumping the sweat! How bout chu? 🥺
