Finally make Nonya Kueh before going back to work next week. @miketanhp has been requesting for Kueh Salat aka Kuih Seri Muka for a while. Didn't realise the key to making Kueh Salat is in the steaming of the custard. Normally I would reference a few similar recipes to check on the process. However, this time round I didnt do that and it almost wreak havoc on my kueh. Fortunately, I started googling for similar recipes while steaming and realised where my mistake was and managed to salvage it. ðŸ˜… Anyway still taste good just appearance is not that great! #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomeforsg
