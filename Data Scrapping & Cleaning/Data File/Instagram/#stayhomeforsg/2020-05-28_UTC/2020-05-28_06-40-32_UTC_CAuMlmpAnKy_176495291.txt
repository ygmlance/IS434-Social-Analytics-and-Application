â€¢ Fizzy Ocean Play â€¢ 
This is another baking soda + vinegar experiment we did yesterday. Previously we did baking soda and vinegar experiments in various ways such as blowing balloons or just simple drop off vinegar to baking soda and Aiden is loving all of them, simply because of the fizzy effect.

So yesterday I created fizzy ocean play for him by putting baking soda on a tray and add on some sea animals. I then pour some vinegar on two bowls and add on blue and green food colouring. 
The play began with Aiden starting to drop the vinegar into the baking soda and his reactions are full of WOW words ðŸ’™ Our tray and droppers are from Shopee Indonesia :) #1001idebermainanak #montessoriathome #activitiesforkids #kids#learning #activitiesforchildren #idemainanak #earlylearning #learnthroughplay #playislearning #diy #preschool #learningisfun #kidsactivity #montessori #playideas #playbasedlearning #homebasedlearning #playandlearn #stayhomeforsg #toddleractivitiesathome #idemainananak #maindirumah #bermaindirumah
