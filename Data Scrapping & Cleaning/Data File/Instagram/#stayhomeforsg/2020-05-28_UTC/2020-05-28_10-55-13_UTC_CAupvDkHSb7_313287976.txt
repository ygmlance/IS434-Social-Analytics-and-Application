It's Mum's death anniversary today so decided to have a little vegetarian mala xiang guo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 with my Knorrs mala sauce add on extra belachan chilli. Sweat out rather than tears out 😢 It's been 6 years since she left and I am thankful that she and my late Dad have passed their cooking blood cells to me or else during this CB period, I would have suffered alone.  Hope both of you are looking down from heaven and feeling proud of me too 😘😘 I can so imagine if both of you are still alive, we would have been enjoying this together happily 😋😭 Love you both and still miss your presence till this day ❤️💞 #icookienjoy
