Artist Gregory Halili (@gregoryhalili) captures the distinctive characteristics of eyes through delicate paintings on mother-of-pearl shells in 'Karagatan (The Breadth of Oceans)'. Drawing upon a sacred royal tradition, these portraits pay homage to the coastal community whose fortunes are bound to the sea, as they constantly labour to harvest the ocean's bounty but rarely reap its wealth.
