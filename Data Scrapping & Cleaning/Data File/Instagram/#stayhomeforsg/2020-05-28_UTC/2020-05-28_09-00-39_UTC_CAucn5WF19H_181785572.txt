Made cinnamon rolls for the first time. Thank God I bought Mistral 30L Electric Oven during Circuit Breaker so I can experiment new bakes every few days to keep me away form boredom! üòù

Timing just nice to bring a hot one out from oven to my man as tea break together with a avocado smoothie. 
Recipe:

Quick Homemade Cinnamon Rolls (in 4 steps)

To make the bread dough:
‚Ä¢ All purpose flour: 3 cups (130g x 3=390g)
‚Ä¢ Warm Milk 3/4 Cup (180 g)
‚Ä¢ Unsalted Butter (softened)1/4 Cup /57g
‚Ä¢ 1 Egg(at Room Temperature)
‚Ä¢ Sugar 2 and 1/2 tbsp /32g
‚Ä¢ Salt 1and 1/4 tsp
‚Ä¢ Yeast (instant /active dried yeast) 1tsp

For the filling (combined):
‚Ä¢ Soft Brown Sugar (packed cup)1/2 cup /90g
‚Ä¢ Unsalted Butter(softened) 1/4 cup /57g
‚Ä¢ Cinnamon Powder 2 tsp ‚úì Step 1: BREAD DOUGH
Combine everything, except flour, and mix well. Add to flour to form a shaggy dough.
Knead the dough for a few minutes (3 - 4 minutes) until it form a smooth dough. Let the dough sit for a few minutes so that the gluten stands will relax. ‚úì Step 2: SHAPE THE DOUGH
Pat, stretch and roll out the dough to form a rectangular and thickness about 1/4". Spread the filling on the dough with a spatula as evenly as possible. Roll the dough into a cylinder shape. Roughly measure and into 12 equal parts (after trimming the ends). Transfer to a baking tray (I put baking paper for easier cleaning). ‚úì Step 3: PROOF THE CINNAMON ROLLS
Cover the tray with a cling wrap and allow the rolls to rise until puffy and the rolls are touching one another; 50 to 60 minutes. ‚úì Step 4: BAKE THE CINNAMON ROLLS 
Bake the cinnamon rolls at 180¬∞ for 20mins with Mistral 30L Electric Oven.
Sprinkle icing sugar and serve hot.
