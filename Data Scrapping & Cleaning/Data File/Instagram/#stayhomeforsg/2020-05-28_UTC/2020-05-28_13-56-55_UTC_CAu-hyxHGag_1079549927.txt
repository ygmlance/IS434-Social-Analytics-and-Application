The reason for today's lunch and dinner feasting is son's 21st birthday. Stuck at home with family instead of partying with his kaki2 😁😂 Dinner is from Preludio at Frasers Tower. Chef Fernando's "char siew", pastas, risotto plus Chef Elena's desserts. Don't know about son, but ah pek is at "maximum happiness" after the meal!! #sgunited #savefnbsg #stayhomeforSg
