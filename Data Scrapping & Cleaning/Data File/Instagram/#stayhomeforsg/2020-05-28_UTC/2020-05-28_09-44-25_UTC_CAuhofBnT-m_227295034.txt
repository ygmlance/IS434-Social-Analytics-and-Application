My first attempt at making Tandoori Chicken 🐔 with air fryer & it's a success 👍. I intentionally charred it for more enjoyment 😍. It was super delicious 😋!!! The crispy charred chicken skin was so satisfying while the meat was still tender, not dry. My little girl 👧 ate non stop 1 after another 😍. I'm using Organic Fresh Boneless Chicken Legs from @keesonggroup. Original recipe in 1st comment below. To cater to my little girl 👧, I adjusted the recipe, also added 💎 KW Powder: G, GN. My recipe will be posting in the upcoming posting... Stay with me 😊.⠀
