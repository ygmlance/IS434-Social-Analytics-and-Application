Pork stir fry with green beans
干煸四季豆，炒起来!

Ingredients:
300 g green beans
220 g pork mince
1/2 small onion, finely chopped
2 tsp finely chopped garlic (2 cloves) 
2 tsp ginger, finely chopped
2 1/2 tbsp oil 
For the sauce:
1 tbsp dark soy sauce
1 tbsp shao xing wine
1 tsp sugar
1 1/2 tsp + Chilli Garlic Sauce (optional, if desire slightly spicy)

Recipe:
1. Mix sauce ingredients in a bowl.

2. Trim the end of the beans, then chop into 2 - 2.5cm pieces.

3. Charred beans: Heat 1 1/2 tbsp oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until smoking. Add beans, spread out to cover base. Leave for 1 min. Quick stir, spread out, cook for 30 secs. Stir, then leave for 30 secs. Repeat once more until beans are slightly charred but tender crisp. Remove into bowl. **You can omit this step 3 if you prefer your long beans not charred, it's fine too. For me, i omitted this step today, just to be quicker haha

4. Turn heat down to medium high, add 1 tbsp oil. Add onion, then garlic and ginger. Cook for 1 min until edges of onion are golden.

5. Turn heat back up to high. Add pork and cook, breaking it up as you go. Cook for 2 mins until the pork is cooked through, then add Sauce. Cook for 30 secs, then add beans and stir for another 30 secs. 
Done! Serve it with rice! ☺️
