All-in-one meal!! Silky smooth egg horfun with shabu shabu pork, fresh live prawns🦐🦐 from @apollomarineseafood and kailan veg.
.
Cooked this a couple of weeks bk but promptly forgot to post.
.
Did an extra step of frying the horfun with dark soy sauce to create the 'wok hei' charred taste.
.
You can see from the colour how gorgeous are the prawns!
Live prawns it says though they were already dead when they were delivered which was fine with me!! 😰 so scary to see them alive!! I love the crunchiness and freshness!!
.
Enjoy!! Video to come after I finish editing 😁
