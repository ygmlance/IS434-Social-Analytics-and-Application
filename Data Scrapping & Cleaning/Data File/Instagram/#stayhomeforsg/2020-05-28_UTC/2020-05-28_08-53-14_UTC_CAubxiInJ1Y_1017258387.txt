CB Day 52 - This bag appeared at my door step while I was in the middle of work. 
I think this is the sign to stop working and start drinking.
Except I don't drink beer. And so, I shall pop open a bottle of wine later. 🍷🍺🍻 #CB #CBDay52 #Heineken #Beers #Drinks #HappyHour #DrinkingTime #Alcohol #Alcoholic #StayHomeToDrink #StayAtHome #StayHomeForSG #SGUnited
