Anybody loves these red kiwis as much as I do? A little less tangy than the green ones and it boosts a gorgeous sweet berry-like flavor. I love these in in my acai berry and granola bowls for an extra nutritious breakfast filled with vitamins!

I was reading and found out that kiwis are great for digestion too! They contain an enzyme called actinidain or actinidin which helps breaks down protein, dairy and eggs... So you should definitely have them after a heavy meal to ease the bloat!
