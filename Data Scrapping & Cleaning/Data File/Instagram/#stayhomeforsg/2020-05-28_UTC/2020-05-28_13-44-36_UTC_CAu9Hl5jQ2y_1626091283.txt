GO HEAVY OR GO HOME ! ERM... WAIT A MINUTE... Iâ€™M ALREADY HOME...
.
Weights Training During the LockDown. It's been a challenge... and I really do miss my PT stacking and fetching the waits for me... :) At home, it's been all DIY.  A combination of resistance bands, body weight exercises and home dumbbells ..and I never realised how difficult it was to do a Bench Press on the floor! Almost injured my wrists... I guess that's why it's called a BENCH Press... :) But just this afternoon... my new GYM BENCH arrived! Happiness. :)
