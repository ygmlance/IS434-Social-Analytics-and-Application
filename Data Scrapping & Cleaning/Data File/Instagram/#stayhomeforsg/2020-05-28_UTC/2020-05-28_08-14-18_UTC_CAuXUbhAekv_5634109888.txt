Craving for something chocolatey and sweet at its best! Iâ€™ve ran out of my 85% dark chocolate and is very tempted to run to the kitchen to bake some chocolate cake to get my craving fix. I also went to a keto bake page to check out their bake but nothing is for immediate delivery.
.
I want to have it now!!!! Now!!! Not later or tomorrow. However, I canâ€™t bake now as its still within my working hour. When I open the fridge and saw the cocoa powder and almond milk! I immediate know what I am suppose to do! A glass of chocolate milk, yesh! Itâ€™s so syiok till I almost forget to to take photo of it.
.
Recipe: Almond Milk + Cocoa Powder + Keto approves sweetener. The ratio of the cocoa powder and sweeter must be the same. As for the amount of almond milk, its up to your liking - chocolatey or mild. I prefer mine to be very chocolatey! ðŸ˜‹
