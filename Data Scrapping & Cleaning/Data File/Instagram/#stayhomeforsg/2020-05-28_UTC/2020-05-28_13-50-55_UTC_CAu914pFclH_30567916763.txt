#circuitbreakersg day 52

The first time I had oden was during my first visit to Tokyo in 2011. I remember arriving late on a windy night in March, and was dragging my luggage from the bus station towards the hotel when I passed by a street cart selling oden. As the weather was quite chilly, it felt so right to stop by for some oden, and so I did. ☺️😋

Got these oden the other day from @dondondonkisg because I miss eating them and also because they make for an easy and quick meal. 😃

That trip to Tokyo was particularly memorable - I was there when the tsunami hit on 11 March 2011 and experienced earthquake for the first time. It was frightening and I still remember vividly how I felt at that time. When news broke out, mobile connections were poor and many friends who knew I was in Japan then were all trying to reach me to check if I was safe. For that, I still remain grateful until today. 💙 #gratitudediary
