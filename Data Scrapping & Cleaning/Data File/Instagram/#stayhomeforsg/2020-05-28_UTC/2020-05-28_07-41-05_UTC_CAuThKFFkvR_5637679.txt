#DearCovid19SG 🦠,
•
Not only have you given Singapore 🇸🇬 a break, you gave the whole world 🌍 a break.
•
Initially I detest you (pretty much still do) for messing up with our lives and have taken some lives.
•
However, no doubt, still gotta thank you. Earth's Ozone layer is healing. Elephants are released back to the wild in Thailand to freely roam due to the drop in tourism. (So glad for this!) Well, much more too.
•
I guess this is what people always say, "Blessing in disguise." ✨
•
I also appreciate having the luxury of time to spend it on meaningful stuff (though I still side track sometimes). I managed to incorporate workout 🏋🏻‍♀️ in my daily routine (not just that, I’ve become stronger! 💪🏻), to spend time and cook meals 👩🏻‍🍳 for my family, and to declutter my room & thoughts. Probably my bosses might not be happy, but I really enjoy WFH (haha), mainly due to the lack in transporting to & fro office.
•
There can still be process in this pause. Even if the world is at a PAUSE⏸, we can still PROGRESS➡️.
•
Please get well soon, I WANT TO TRAVEL, head out and meet my friends & bf...
