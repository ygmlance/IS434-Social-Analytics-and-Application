Dear Kiztopia fans, following the latest announcement by the government and in tandem with the phased approach of resuming activities post-circuit breaker, our park will remain closed temporarily till further notice. We were really looking forward to welcoming all of you back 😔, but the health and well-being of our guests remain our utmost priority. Once we have the exact re-opening date, we will keep all of you informed. If you have any further queries, please DM us and we will do our best to attend to you as quickly as possible.
.
We will continue to bring you more fun #stayhomewithKiztopia activities to stay occupied at home, as well as exciting news, giveaways, and more! Be sure to stay tune to our social media pages! 😉 Counting down to the day when we can meet again. Till then, stay well and stay safe everyone! ❤️ .
