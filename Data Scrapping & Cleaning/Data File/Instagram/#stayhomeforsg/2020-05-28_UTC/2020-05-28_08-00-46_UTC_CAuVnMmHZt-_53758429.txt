Art with Dabox 4th Edition.
In this edition,
We get to paint Yayoi Kusama inspired polka dots pumpkin. 
Yayoi Kusama’s work is such an inspiration. I want bigT to learn about this artist. So before we started unboxing #dabox I took sometime to show her a storybook about Yayoi Kusama on YouTube. 
The book “Kusama from here to infinity”

She asked a lot of questions as always(spare you what she said) 
I told BigT she too can Creative lotsa & lotsa beautiful dots. So let’s start painting.

I would think BigT will need a lot of help in doing the repetitive dots. Well actually not, she master it very quickly and did the entire painting herself. I only guided her and gave some advise. She has improved so much with Dabox. 
There is a step by step instructions inside Dabox. But for this one. BigT wanted to use her favourite colour. Why not! Do feel free and allow your child to switch things up. After all “no one pumpkin is the same”. I know because #mamamindee grows pumpkin. 😊

Sharing with all you her dotty pumpkin. Remember to like this video and get Dabox from @dalittleartsschool
