As I go down the rabbit hole of growing a bigger and bigger starter pool for bread baking, I know that I’ve gotta trim it down with discard. And so I thoroughly enjoy the idea of making one of my all time favourite indulgent breakfast pancakes with it. .
Pancakes are such a crowd pleaser. Well at least I’ve not come across anyone who dislikes it. I like it enough but I like it even more when I can have colourful toppings, made up of a medley of seasonal fruits and nuts of choice, and for something a little more decadent, a salted chocolate glaze to go with the usual maple syrup. And because it’s all about nutritional and flavour profile balance, finish with a side of sunny side up egg and bacon. .
Et voila! A happy tummy. .
