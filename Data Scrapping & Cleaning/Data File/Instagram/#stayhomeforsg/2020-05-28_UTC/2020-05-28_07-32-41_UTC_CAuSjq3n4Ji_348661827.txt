*slaps my own ass* = self care. And by god, we all need it at this point. 
Literally wearing my bikini in the house today for #wfh #ootd as I attempt to even out my crazy tan lines on the balcony while working. If I had neon lights, you could literally see all my sports bra strap lines and where my hydration bottles sits ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚(been averaging 20km daily running/biking). At this rate, I will most likely contract dengue or die from a sunstroke (literally handing myself on a platter to the ðŸ¦Ÿ). What is up with the humid, muggy weather lately? Been living on this island for the better half of my life and I ask the same question every day of the year...
