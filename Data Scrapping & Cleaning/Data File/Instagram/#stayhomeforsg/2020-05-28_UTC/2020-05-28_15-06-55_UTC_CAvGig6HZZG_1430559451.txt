This caption was hard to write!

The heavens remained wide open as I struggled, out of food coma, to find the words that straddle the fine line between my renewed passion for and compulsive obsession with THEATRE.

You see, I've been lapping up 'free screenings' at the rate of close to 1 production every day for almost a month. In between, I take in reviews, interviews and behind-the-scenes videos during and after meals. At weekends, I send a good number of WhatsApp as well as Instagram contacts my playlist for the following week.

Oh yes, DM me if you'd like to receive it too!

Hmm...I suppose it's politically-correct to characterise this period as a bountiful blessing of online exposure and self-directed learning for the keen student of theatre in me? ðŸ˜‰

And when I think deeply about the subject matter, my formation years at @NIESingapore often come to mind. I wish to take the next moment to thank the late Dr Stephen Hazell, lecturer and enabler, for taking a chance on me 20 years ago. He allowed meâ€”'a creative spark that can be fanned into flame' in his wordsâ€”to join the Drama programme then. ðŸ™‡

I'll now close with Mr Oscar Wilde: 'I regard the theatreÂ as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being.' I couldn't agree more!
