Lost count of the number of Zoom calls / group meetings I’ve done this week thus far, but it’s about average seven per day? 🤘🏼🙃
.
It has been really great for sure - catching up w students, learning new stuff etc - but legit tired lol, but thankful for all the techie stuff I’ve gotten and added to the home office, now it’s so comfy that I really prefer WFH to some extent HAHA 🤭🤪🤣
.
Still got a few more items waiting to be delivered, hehe quite exciteddd 🥳🥳🤙🏼
