16 May 2020: 🍛❤️🍛 Pork katsu curry, complete with shredded cabbage, heirloom tomatoes and sesame dressing.

So proud of these.

The pork katsu came out perfectly... I just need a frying tray to cool it. Using parchment paper doesn't quite do it, whilst it soaks up the oil, it does make it soggy because of the panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)and condensation. I want my katsu crispy on both sides!
