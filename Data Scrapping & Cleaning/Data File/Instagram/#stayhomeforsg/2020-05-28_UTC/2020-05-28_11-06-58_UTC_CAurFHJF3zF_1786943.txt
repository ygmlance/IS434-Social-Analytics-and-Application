[SongHomeCafe] 소떡소떡 (𝐑𝐈𝐂𝐄 𝐂𝐀𝐊𝐄 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐒𝐀𝐔𝐒𝐀𝐆𝐄) ⁣
⁣
A must eat whenever at the expressway service area in Korea, these skewers remind me of those long bus rides to different provinces in Korea! ⁣
⁣
They're actually really easy to make! Simple make skewers alternating between a piece of sausage and rice cake. Then pan fry them on a non stick pan! ⁣
⁣
I like to make tiny slits on the sausages before pan frying them. Also, I blanch the rice cakes in hot water for about a minute or so.⁣
⁣
For the sauce: ⁣
• 2 tbsp of soy sauce⁣
• 3 tbsp of ketchup⁣
• 1 tbsp of gochujang⁣
• 2 tbsp of sugar syrup (I didnt have this but I had golden syrup so I used 1 tbsp of it)⁣
• 1 teaspoon of finely minced garlic⁣
• 1 tbsp of cooking wine⁣
⁣
So while pan frying the skewers, you're gonna want to use a brush and apply the sauce to the skewers and pan fry them along with the sauce! Don't really know for how long cos it was kinda eye-powered 🤭 ⁣
⁣
U can serve with a drizzle of mustard over them and extra ketchup if you want! I did a sprinkle of dried parsley as well 😊⁣
