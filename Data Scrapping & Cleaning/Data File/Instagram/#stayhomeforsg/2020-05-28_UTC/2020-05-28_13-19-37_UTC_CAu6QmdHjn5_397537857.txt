My mama ordered 3 big slabs of Pork Belly for me to make the family's favourite Roast Pork Belly (Siew Yoke). Crispy skin & flavorful meat. I'm so glad the family loves it.

The biggest difficulty is chopping the roast pork which I'm really bad at it, any tips?

The other dishes are Napa Cabbage with Oyster Mushroom, Picked Cucumber & Onion Omelette.

Happy #dinner all ðŸ¤—
