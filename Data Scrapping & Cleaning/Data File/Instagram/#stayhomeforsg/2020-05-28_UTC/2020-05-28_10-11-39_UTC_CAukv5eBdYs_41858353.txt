‚Å£Leftover prawn broth from the last post gets repurposed into laksa after a special delivery of homemade laksa paste from @2mamasandawok‚†Ä

Just added the paste to the broth and coconut milk and I had a completely new dish. If you've never had laksa with a really good prawn broth... it's really spectacular, the amount of depth the laksa has is incredible, the spice from the laksa paste comes first but the sweet-savory taste of the prawn broth comes after. Waves and waves of flavor üòå
