ADORA SARAH (15 YEARS in the F & B Industry as a Practitioner) joins us on Ep 21 of IN YOUR HOUSE!

#IYH is a new project by SportSG, created specially for this period when Singaporeans are staying at home due to Covid-19. It's a series of segments showcasing Singaporeans from all walks of life, both in and outside of the country, as they cope with work-from-home orders. In this Skype/Zoom interview based show, we'll discuss each guest's exercise routines, family, the various types of food to stay healthy, leisure activities, plus positive reinforcement messages.

In Pt 1 of Ep 21 on Fri 29 May, be sure to catch, SportSG's very own RAJ KUMAR, as he catches up with ADORA (Regional Key Account Excellence Manager, foodpanda APAC)

Just prior to celebrating her Birthday THIS Sunday, Adora Sarah took time out from her busy schedule, to share with us the details of her current job scope with foodpanda! Looking after 11 markets/countries in the APAC region, Sarah is putting all of her 15 years industry experience to great use, especially in this unprecedented time of Covid-19. She explains the mechanics behind this food delivery service platform and how crucial is the role they play in the CB period. 
Adora also talks about her exciting experience as a DJ at 2 Music Radio Stations, in her persona of "Your Weekend Girlfriend". It's been an 8-year stint so far and will she be back "On the Air" soon, following an 8-month hiatus? 
This Arsenal FC football-loving supporter will also share her thoughts on the Gunners this season, as well as the music which influenced her during her teens and 20s. As the only child, Adora also stressed the importance of family bonding during the last 8 weeks of the CB and creating new memories :) So all that and more are revealed from Noon onwards on Get Active TV Facebook Page!
