#SGunited In the last 100 days, many of us have been very badly hit by the pandemic. Companies are losing money and closing down while people are losing not only their jobs, but also their loved ones.

To help these individuals in the community, RW has started an initiative since the start of Circuit Breaker to help the community by donating essential such as mask and sanitizer to the needy community In Singapore.

As part of the next phase of the #RWCares initiative, we will be launching a series of online charity campaign starting from 29 May 2020 to 5 June 2020!

Embarking on those campaign is beloved guest artist #CaiAiJia who will be streaming her performances live with RW to help us in raising funds for this campaign. Together, we will be raising funds that will be 100% contributed to #SGunited charity organisations.
