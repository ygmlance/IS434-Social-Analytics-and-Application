Roast chicken for today's lunch and dinner. Kind of tired of buying those roast chicken takeouts from Cold Storage or Giant supermarket, plus its kind tasteless or dry at times, so once awhile when we have time we will roast it on our own.

Hoisin Glazed Roast Chicken

Ingredients:
1 whole chicken, washed
5 tbsp Hoisin Sauce, or more just enough to evenly coat the whole chicken
1-2 tbsp Garlic, minced
1 piece of Ginger, approx 2 inch, minced.
5 slices of Ginger (optional)
1 whole scallion
2 tbsp Soy sauce
1 tbsp Sesame oil
1 tbsp Hua diao wine
1 tbsp Honey, more or less depends whether you prefer the sauce to be sweeter.
1 tsp Salt
1 tsp Pepper

Recipe:
1. In a bowl, mix in all the condiments except the whole scallion and sliced ginger. Mix well.

2. Marinate the whole chicken, leave it for about 30mins.

3. Pre heat your oven. Set it to 200deg. **Different oven might be of different setting.

4. Place the whole scallion on the oven tray.

5. Lay the marinated whole chicken on it.

6. Put sliced ginger beneath the whole chicken. This is optional. I do this extra, just in case to get rid of any gamey chicken smell.

7. Glaze the left over marinate sauce on the whole chicken, evenly coated.

8. Bake for 40 to 50mins.

9. Chop it up and you are ready to serve!

いただきます!
