Today is Day 2 into this dramatic play, and we learnt about "Sharing equally among 2 people". [Precursor of division of 2]. Well there are 2 ways of teaching "division", equal sharing and equal grouping.  Suggested steps of playing: 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Get d child to order food for 2 pax, and ask the child to order food items in even number such as 2, 4, 6. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ask the kid to fill in the food quantity on the order form, and d child get to practise writing.
#2a) If the child is just starting to learn to write, give the child a sensorial book or sandpaper numbers to trace the sensorial numbers first and then ask the child to grip the pencil to write the food quantity. As per the video, I am using the book: 123 Count with me by Tiger Tales, to let her trace the numbers first before letting her write on the order form using a pencil. 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Present all d food ingredients on a large serving plate and give d child 2 empty bowls and ask her to share the food ingredients / pizza toppings, equally with her 'Minnie Mouse friend'. Emphasize "sharing equally", else her friend will feel it's unfair and upset. 4Ô∏è‚É£ After sharing equally, ask d child to observe and count the 2 filled bowls to see if they have the same number of ingredients/toppings. At this early stage, I dont introduce the word: "divide" or "division" to my 3 year old yet. 
Well, next time, we shall do some number bonds (Concept: Addition) using pizza toppings. ü§≠ü§≠
Printables from @thejoylearners üëâ Dramatic or pretend play is a fun way to:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Practise writing. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Learn Math concepts. 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Learn practical life skills such as cooperation, listening, turn taking, "washing dishes/clean table", using money etc.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Understand how a cafe/shop/clinic operates. . 
Well dramatic play corner gonna be my "secret Math learning corner". ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠ #jialearnsmath
