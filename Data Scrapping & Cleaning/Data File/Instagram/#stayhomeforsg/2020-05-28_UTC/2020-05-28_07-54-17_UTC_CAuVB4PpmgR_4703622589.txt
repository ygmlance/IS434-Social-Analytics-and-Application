The kiddos wanted pancakes, eggs and sausages for lunch. I took this opportunity to test out the new cast iron skillet I purchased from @ikeasingapore after seasoning it. Verdict, @ $39.90 for an 11” pan, it’s value for money. Pancakes didn’t stick. Next was the egg test...👍🏻. Even if I trash it, I can still buy many more to replace...no heart pain compared to buying a branded one like #lecreuset which I think is overpriced here in Singapore. PS: To see the outcome of cast iron cooking, pictures are raw and real. No food styling. #tryingnewthings #castironskillet #castironcooking #castiron #ikeasingapore #lunchtime #lunch #kidswantpancakes #brunchathome #fitmominthekitchen #cookingforthefamily #homecooks #keepingitreal #momcooks #familymeals #stayhomeforsg #stayhome #sgunited #covid19 #survivingcovid19 #pancakes #pancakeseggsandsausage #eggs #testkitchen  #budgetconscious #valueformoney #cheapdoesnotmeanbad #sourdoughdiscardpancakes #sourdoughdiscard
