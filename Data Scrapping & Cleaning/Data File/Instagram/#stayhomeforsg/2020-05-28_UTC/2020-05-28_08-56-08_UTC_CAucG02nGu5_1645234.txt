4.5 years old today.
.
Emma enjoys building things with magnet tiles, Legos, play pretend with babydolls, likes anything Frozen, and always ask for girly/dressy outfits even when we’re not going anywhere.
.
We’re in between a change of school due to recent move thus she has no homebased-learning. Sometimes she gets so bored during CB and asks to do learning activities with me. She takes the heaviest breakfast in our household, is a cheese and fries lover, and always singing and dancing.
.
During CB, she gets to indulge in daddy @singjie Nintendo Switch. One day i was carrying baby and unable to play with her. She played two players simultaneously on her own using 2 Joy-Con controllers. Lol. Swipe to the last video!

PS: 1st and 2nd photo taken at our Punggol home (for remembrance) before we moved out.
