Tandoori Chicken 🐔 cooked in air fryer & it's a success 😋! I adjusted the recipe so it will be acceptable for my 8yo girl 👧. Original recipe in 1st comment below 👇.⠀
⠀
📝 Ingredients⠀
✔️ Organic Fresh Boneless Chicken Legs from @keesonggroup ⠀
✔️ 1 Tbsp 🥄 💎 KW Garlic Powder ⠀
✔️ 1 tsp 🥄 💎 KW Ginger Powder⠀
✔️ 1 Tbsp 🥄 Vegetable Oil⠀
✔️ 1/2 tsp Coriander Powder⠀
✔️ 1/2 tsp Cumin Powder⠀
✔️ 1/2 tsp Turmeric Powder⠀
✔️ A pinch of Cayenne Powder⠀
✔️ A pinch of Paprika Powder⠀
✔️ 1 Cup Plain Yogurt⠀
✔️ 2 Tbsp Lemon Juice⠀
⠀
🙋 How to Marinate?⠀
1. Add all marinade ingredients into a mixing bowl, mix well until all powder dissolved.⠀
💡 Taste and adjust according to liking. Upon cooked, the sauce will taste very fragrant, the spices will be very well infused, becoming a very distinct taste.⠀
2. Cut 🔪  Boneless Chicken Legs into big cubes, do not remove the skin.⠀
3. Place Boneless Chicken Legs cubes into the marinade spices, coat well, store in fridge overnight 🌙.⠀
⠀
🙋 How to Cook?⠀
1. Insert Chicken into Skewer Sticks. Option to use the Rotating Skewer Rack for 360° rotation, which I didn't.⠀
2. Place on Baking Pan, load to Buffalo Air Fryer, select "Roast" 🌡️ 200°C, ⏳ 25 minutes, flip every 5 minutes to prevent burnt.⠀
3. Lower temperature to 🌡️ 180°C after Chicken turned brown, continue to roast until color is evenly brown with some charred.⠀
4. Rest for ⏳ 10 minutes, remove from Skewer Sticks. Enjoy!⠀
