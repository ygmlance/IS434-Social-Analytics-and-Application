Buttery, rich slices of brioche, fried in a layer of coconut oil + scallion pesto + sliced 🥑 + jammy eggs + pumpkin seeds + furikake + honey sriracha sauce = fireworks in my mouth. While I do love waging wars in the kitchen, cleaning up is an utter bitch; and yknow sometimes even a seemingly easy 5-minute lunch like this is an adventure in itself. For one, I realised the latest batch of eggs from the supermarket takes even lesser time to cook. In my recent post on soy sauce eggs, I shared how I cook my eggs for just 5 1/2 minutes (as opposed to the widely acknowledged 6-6 1/2 minutes) because that works best for me. Well it didn’t work this time. I went down to 4 1/2 minutes of cooking time before getting the same jammy-yolked result. Point is: if you’re trying your hand at making the perfect boiled eggs, test one first and adjust your time accordingly. And with that I‘ll leave you with a quick recipe for this uber simple honey sriracha sauce that I’ve taken to liberally drizzle over anything and everything 🙃 It’s so easy I don’t even want to call it a recipe lol. Just mix sriracha, honey, and soy sauce in a ratio of 2:2:1, and you’ve got yourself an amazing sauce on hand. Mix this with 1-2 tbsp of oil, toss it with some veggies and roast it all in the oven for a quick meal. Or make a compound butter with this and poach some salmon in it. Or grill some skin-on chicken on the skillet and baste with this sauce. Ah ideas ideas 😍 #CEBcooks
