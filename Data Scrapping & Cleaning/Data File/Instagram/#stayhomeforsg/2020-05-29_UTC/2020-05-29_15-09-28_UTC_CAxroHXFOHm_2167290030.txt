DAY 52, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
(countdown ... 4 days to go)
Dumplings in Chilli Broth

Just one of those days ..... when no one is home for lunch, and there are no leftovers in the fridge, and you are too lazy to go buy food, and its too small an order to have home delivery, and you dont want to eat instant noodles 😂😂
What do you do??
You take out a box of the broth you freeze every now n then. Thaw and boil it.
You also take some frozen dumplings that you have in the deep freeze and put it in the broth.
You add some chilli oil and oyster sauce.
And you add some chinese parsley too.
And thats your lunch 😁😁
Believe it or not, it was delicious, absolutely full of flavour.
