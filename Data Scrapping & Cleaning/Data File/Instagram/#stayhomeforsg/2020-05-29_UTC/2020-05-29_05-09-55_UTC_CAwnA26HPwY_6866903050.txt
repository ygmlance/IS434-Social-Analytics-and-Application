To “Tong Ju” #撑住 during this #stayhomeforsg It’s Time for some #tonkatsu #とんかつ #豚カツ 😂Using #porkloin for the main ingredient as it has a thin layer of #fats and hammering the pork evenly to soften the texture. After seasoning with #salt and #pepper, coat it with #flour #egg and #Panko and deep fry it. Allow resting time of 4 mins. Also added the readymade #ebicroquette To Serve, slice #japanesecabbage #tomato and drizzle with #katsusauce Words cannot describe this simple yet divine pairing of #soft #moist #pork and the sweet #cabbage #sauce and #japaneserice #homecooked
