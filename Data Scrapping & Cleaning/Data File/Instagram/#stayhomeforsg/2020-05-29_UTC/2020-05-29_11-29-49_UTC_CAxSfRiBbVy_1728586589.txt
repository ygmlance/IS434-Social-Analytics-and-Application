Todayâ€™s bake. Banana pie. Cos I have craving for the famous banana pie at Katong Shopping Centre. I actually made them into tarts but regret it cos it is so tedious to press it nicely into 12 moulds. Should have make one big pie and cut. Probably my last bake for CB. #ktbakingjourney #homebaking #bananapie #circuitbreaker #day53 #stayhomeforsg
