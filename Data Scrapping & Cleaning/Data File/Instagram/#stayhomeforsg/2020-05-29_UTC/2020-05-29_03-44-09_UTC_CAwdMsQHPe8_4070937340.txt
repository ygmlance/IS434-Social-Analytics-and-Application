Came across this #wod by @theboxprogramming ! It’s something I can do at home and it looks manageable😃 So, last night, 40min before bb Elijah’s bedtime, I decided to give it a try💪🏻 .
.
I have alot to thank my husband and my baby for completing the workout in 29.40 minutes😑 Halfway through the workout, bb Elijah poop💩and my hubby hurried me to end my workout because he wanted us to clean up bb and put him to bed😤 Determined to complete my workout, I endured the fatigue and I made it! .
.
The story didn’t end here being a MUM😪bloody exhausted, I dried myself and head to shower. After that we cleaned up bb and I nursed him to sleep. After 30 min of nursing my bb didn’t sleep😭
.
.
He was frustrated due to the lack of milk. You know why???!! Cause I only ate a pandan cake and drank some soya milk for pre workout. I wanted to save my dinner for post workout. .
. 
I had to call in my hubby who was exercising in the living room to take over bb while I warmed my milk to bottle feed him. While waiting, I gobbled down my dinner and spammed lots of water so that my body can recover and generate milk ASAP😫
.
.
I passed the bottle to my hubby to feed bb. BOY! you know what? bb doesn’t want the bottle! He FORGOT how to drink from the bottle🤦🏻‍♀️he tried but kept gagging! I tried feeding him from a small cup which was what the hospital did but still TO NO AVAIL😭He kept turning his head towards my boobs 😭Btw we don’t bottle feed him much after my confinement nanny left. We only do so when I need to be away for long(which happened only once). .
.
I was already damn exhausted but I had to endure😭My husband continued him exercise while I carried my cranky bb around the house. 30min later, he was crying murder😫I brought him back to the room and nursed him with my half filled boobs. I had no confident😔Thankfully he fell asleep after drinking.l could tell he wasn’t in deep sleep. I probably didn’t produce enough milk in such a short time. Btw it was 12.30am🥱
.
.
1.5 hours later, he woke up crying. By then my boobs was full again😃I fed him and he slept for 4 hours straight👏🏻 lesson learnt-dinner b4 workout, workout earlier if possible!
