Today we eat like the royal family😂 bcoz we had 青龙菜 also known as Royal Chives. The family loves this vegetable and we would always order 2 portions of this from Zi Char stall but it's damn bloody expensive, portion is very little and they actually add starch to it so it's buay #KetoFriendly . So nice to cook and eat this at home but this vegetable is not always available. ⁣
