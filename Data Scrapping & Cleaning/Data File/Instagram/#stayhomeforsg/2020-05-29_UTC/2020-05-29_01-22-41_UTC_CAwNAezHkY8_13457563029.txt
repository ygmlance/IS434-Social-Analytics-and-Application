Do you have a child who enjoys a good tracing activity? Here’s a quick tutorial on how you can get a reusable tracing board done up in just a few minutes.
.
✂️ Now, get your cardboard/paper, scissors/penknife, clear folder and a marker ready!
.
After creating this board, I did some enhancements which I found very helpful:
🌟 Added a circle (to denote starting point) and directional arrows to guide my girl on the right strokes
🌟 Installed a pen holder at the top to hold stationary. Holder idea inspired by @milamsathome_montessori .
.
Swipe ⬅️ to view the enhancements. I’ll also be sharing in stories, my little girl in action. This board looks unassuming, but it really kept her very engaged - best of all, it’s so easy to make!
.
Number tracing board inspired by @countingwithkids and @mothercould . And because I don’t have tape available, I used a clear folder.
.
💕 Save this, share it and if you try this craft, remember to tag me so I can see your version too!
.
🕊 Happy Friday!
