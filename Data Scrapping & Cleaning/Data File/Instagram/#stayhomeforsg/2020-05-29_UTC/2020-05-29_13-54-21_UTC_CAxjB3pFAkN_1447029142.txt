TGIF!! Cheesecake brownies trifle. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ No-bake, just the way I like it.
Layered with brownies, whipped cream cheese/cream and ladyfingers.

The tiramisu that the girls made for Mother's day only used up half of the ingredients. So it's like the gift that keeps on giving!! Tiramisu, basque burnt cheesecake and now this!! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„These were made from the last bit of leftovers plus a couple of pcs of brownies stashed in the freezer.

I did soaked the ladyfingers with some liqueur! ðŸ˜‰
