Breakfast 👨‍👩‍👧☀️🍴 with my LOVE 🥰! Potato Croquette with Scrambled Eggs, Johnsonville Sausage, Spring Onion Prata & Blueberries, tops with a dash of @saltverk Lava Salt 😋.⠀
⠀
Accidently steamed a pot of Potatoes 🥔 for Dinner yet last minute change of mind 🤔 decided not to serve it. The following morning I mashed 👊 it, added a tiny bits of Cooked Chicken Breast Meat 🐔, Butter 🧈, 💎 KW Powder: ***BC, G, coated with Panko Breadcrumbs then baked in air fryer 🌡️ 160°C for ⏳ 15 minutes, midway flip once. No recipe, just based on my gut feel, mix mix then bake. Taste was good, however it was not firm enough. Should have added Egg and more Minced Meat 😉.⠀
