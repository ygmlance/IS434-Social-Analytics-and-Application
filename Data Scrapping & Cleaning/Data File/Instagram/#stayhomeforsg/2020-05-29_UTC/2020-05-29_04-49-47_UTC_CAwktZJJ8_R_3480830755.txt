Fried Rice is a simple-to-make and delicious one-pan meal that I love to cook and the family will always say yes to.

It's Thai Pineapple Fried Rice with Prawn this afternoon. Almost friyay and wanna make something fanciful, so I spent a lil effort making a pineapple boat. Kinda tiny for the jumbo prawns 😅

Added some Bak Kwa & Pork Floss from @Hupchong.

Enjoy your lunch too!
