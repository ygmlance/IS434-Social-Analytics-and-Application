TGIF Day 53 of Circuit Breaker.
Having my happy meal with friends of Sanrio.
I have Hello Kitty, Pom Pom Purin,  Gudetama & Baby Cinnamon all with me.😁
Today Is the first time I make Steamed Bread Pudding.
I need to used up this loaf of Gardenia 100% wholemeal Extra Soft & fine bread.
Goggle for some recipe and I improvised a little bit. 😁
The rest of my ingredients are egg, soy milk, cranberries & chocolates. I chopped up some macadamia chocolate. 
The original recipe used Raisins only. 
Tutorial on my next post. 😊
It is very Yummy and super soft.
I think if you want a harder version you can used other Gardenia bread to do it. 😁
Served on a cute Gudetama plate, and Baby Cinnamon fork. And a cup of Soy Milk served on Pom Pom Purin cup.
