STAY HOME WITH SWO
・
Finally, we are at the last weekend of “circuit breaker”!
・
To conclude the stay-home series, @SembawangWindOrchestra will be presenting its final piece, Do-enka Express《演歌》(link in profile) played by soloist, Mr. @joshk_phassakorn at the Victoria Concert Hall, Singapore under the baton of Mr. @desmondng in 2016 during its 25th anniversary concert.
・
The piece explores the rich styles of traditional song forms originating from Japan. Revolving around the ideas of love and loss, loneliness, enduring hardships, and preserverance in the face of difficulties, Do-enka expresses the orchestra’s existing will and desire to continue our work in the local music scene.
