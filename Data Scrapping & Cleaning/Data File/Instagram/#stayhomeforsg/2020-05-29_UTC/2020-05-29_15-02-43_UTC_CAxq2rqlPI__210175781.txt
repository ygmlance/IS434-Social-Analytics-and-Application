Late post today - Long post too. I woke up late today as I was tired and this morning was cold!

Overslept because I slept late. 😪 (Was binge reading the 2nd last chapter of Extreme Ownership - love this book. Will do a review on it another time)

Fortunately, still managed to squeeze in a 25min run in the morning and prepare for the day.

Today's post, I'm sharing about my routine of writing down my goals twice daily - once in the morning when I wake up and another time before I sleep. I learnt this technique from @grantcardone

This is great for helping me keep track of my goals. Goals written down once a year will be forgotten. Writing it daily forces me to pay attention to it.

I did this on and off since 2017 until I tried to commit to it for my 2020 resolutions. Was not successful until one of the goals I wanted to achieved appeared in front of me. It was a sign I should take it seriously and then, a 2nd goal relating to income I wanted to achieved nearly manifested itself.

From then on, I believed strongly in this and have committed to writing it daily since 6th March 2020. It sounds abit silly to do this but it does help maintain focus. It reminds me daily consciously and subconsciously why I have to persevere through difficult situations.

Situations change like 2020's pandemic/quarantine/recession, etc. My mood goes up and down from day to day. A goal written down takes away the emotion and focuses on the target. 🎯

Wish everyone a wonderful evening and have a great weekend ahead. 🙏
