I am going to confess that I will miss this. The chance to parent more and be part of the girls' lives.

But returning back to somewhat normalcy is very welcome as well. Now we're probably looking forward to a new era of innovations and interactions. A new way of daily life and a new way of doing business.

What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. Let's power on.
