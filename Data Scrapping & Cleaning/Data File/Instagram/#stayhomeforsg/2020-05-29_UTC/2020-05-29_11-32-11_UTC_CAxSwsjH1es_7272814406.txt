Measurement of Success

@aidanchemaly talked about success of the day and taking steps towards them.

My greatest success during this CB was doing this 5.5km brisk walk after dinner every day. More importantly, it's about doing it with dad. It started with me going to the 7 11 outside my place (a 10 min walk max). And dad decided to join in. We detoured and started walking longer and longer distance. What was a 10 min errand, became a daily 1 hour brisk walk session together.

Those who know me, know I hardly get to spend time with dad. And this 1 hour session of awkward silence became one we have to think of topics to talk about, and then a bit more sharing of our own experiences outside. I have never spent so much time with dad (a solid 1 hour together) and it made me more determined that I should spend one evening a week next time to keep this ritual going.

While dad went out this evening to run an errand, I still carry on with my brisk walk. It's my recovery session for my Crossfit workouts too.

So, there you go - my success is developing a brisk walk habit while bonding with my dad, little by little.
