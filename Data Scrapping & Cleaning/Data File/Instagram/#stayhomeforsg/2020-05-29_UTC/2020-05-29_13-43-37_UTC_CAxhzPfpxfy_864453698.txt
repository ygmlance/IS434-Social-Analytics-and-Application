My favourite dish was definitely the signature Twin Towers Crispy Noodles ($10)! This striking dish consists of two ‚Äúsheng mian towers‚Äù perched on a broth filled with sliced fish, clams, and prawns.

The broth was savoury, flavourful, and thick, clinging onto every strand of the crispy noodles. They were quite generous with the seafood too. Overall a very satisfying dish.

Lam‚Äôs Garden offers quality zi char dishes at reasonable prices. $5 islandwide delivery fee is really cheap, and the minimum order of $15 is lower than many other restaurants in Singapore. This is definitely a good option for delivery if you‚Äôre having a craving for Chinese comfort food.
