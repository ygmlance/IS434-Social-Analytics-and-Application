Watched a YouTube demo on letting water do the blending instead of blending the colour on the palette before painting to achieve interesting effects.
But does this method works for everything? I watched so many IG video demos but I’ve not seen this method except on trees and skies.
Do share your knowledge if you are a watercolourist.
Thanks!🙏
