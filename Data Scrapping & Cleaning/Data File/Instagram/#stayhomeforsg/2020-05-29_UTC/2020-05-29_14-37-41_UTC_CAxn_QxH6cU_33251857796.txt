SmartyPence Tip 💡
Get smarter with the NLB app today, free books, papers & magazines! I have always loved the NLB app. The selection is (Fiction, Business, Self-improvement, Keto cooking, Economist, anything!). I love how you can sync them between devices (my ipad & phone) so you never get lost on your progress! I am going to check out Becoming which I checked out on a skip-the-line new feature for a 7 day loan. Coolios!! Holds are free & when the book is due its gets checked out automatically so you never get an overdue fine. Sounds awesome right? 😁 .
Take the remaining post CB PHASE 1 time to widen your knowledge & skillset. Time to get reading this weekend! 📖💪🏻 📸 Taken by my Uncle.
