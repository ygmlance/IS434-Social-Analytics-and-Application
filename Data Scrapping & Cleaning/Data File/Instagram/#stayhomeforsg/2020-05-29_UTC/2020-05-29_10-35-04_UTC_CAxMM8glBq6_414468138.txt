✨Friendship is Magic✨
Our smell-your-chouchou zoom party! 🥳 First posted on @starzaerial a few weeks back, but this is the music which I originally wanted to overlay, hahaha!
🎶ah ah ah ahhhhhh~

Some friendships are such that even though we see/talk to each other everyday, we still dream of each other while asleep! Lost count of the number of dreams we had of each other during this #CircuitBreaker, it’s just hilarious! 🤪💙 And of course there are those whom even though we don’t see/talk everyday, you know they’re always there. You know who you are~ 😘
