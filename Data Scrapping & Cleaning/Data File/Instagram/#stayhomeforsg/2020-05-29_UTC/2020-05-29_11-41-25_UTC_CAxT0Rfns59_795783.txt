Mini Cheesecake! 😍 Love how it's bite sized = guilt-free! 😂 And so easy to make! I can make this anytime! #cheesecake #minicheesecake #homebaking #stayhomeforSG #stayhomewithascott

This is so damn good that I'm probably not buying from outside anymore unless I can't find ingredients... 🤭 And the kids absolutely love it and they are damn picky eaters... Recipe from @elmundoeats
