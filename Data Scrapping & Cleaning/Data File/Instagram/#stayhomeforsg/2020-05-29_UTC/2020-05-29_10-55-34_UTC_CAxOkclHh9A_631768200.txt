Cheese Otar made from Cow Head slice cheese and New Moon Muar Otar.
I finally got a chance to try this Otar which I had read good reviews on IG.
Very east to make.
Just layer a slice of cheese on top of the Otar.
I keep the next half of the Otar for my breakfast to make Otar toast.
You can use the whole piece if you are cooking for your family to share but you need two slices of Cheese.
Wrapped it up with foil or banana leaves if you have and steamed.
Easy.
