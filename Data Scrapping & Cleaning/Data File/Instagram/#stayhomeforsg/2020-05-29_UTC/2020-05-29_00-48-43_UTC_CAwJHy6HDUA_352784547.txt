finally got my Madeleine pan🐚💕and a stash of @nestle instant matcha latte 🍵 from @donkisg 🥰 hence decided to try my first Madeleine bake inspired by @justonecookbook again🤭💕 I twerked the proportions and amount to suit my small intake + less sweet needs🥰✨and turned out to be really yummy✨there isn’t a strong matcha taste cos I’m still procrastinating about spending money on better matcha powder💸but I love how it turned out to have a fragrant milky flavor with hint of matcha😊 first time doing chocolate glazing which needs some improvement hence will try again before sharing that💪 but for original matcha latte Madeleine it’s a success for me😊it’s really a simple and quick bake (since u can prep the night before) just need to invest in that pretty pan🤩happy Friday everyone! Hope I make u all wanna bake this wkend too😂✨
