The third episode of this series features SAM's Senior Curator Joyce Toh who will transport us back in time to Gregory Halili's (@gregoryhalili) work – 'Karagatan (The Breadth of Oceans)' – at the Singapore Biennale 2016. 
Watch her deep dive into the inspiration and process behind Halili's delicate paintings on mother-of-pearl shells. Drawing upon a sacred royal tradition,  these distinctive portraits pay homage to the coastal community whose fortunes are bound to the sea, as they constantly labour to harvest the ocean's bounty but rarely reap its wealth.
