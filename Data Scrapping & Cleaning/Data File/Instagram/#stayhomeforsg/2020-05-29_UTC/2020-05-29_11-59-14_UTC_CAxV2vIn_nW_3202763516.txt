Fishhead steamboat recipe credit @ieatishootipost
Found his old recipe dating back to 2014 on his FB. Recipe certainly a keeper. Adapted by adding leeks, fried seabass collar, fried beancurd roll with fish paste.
1) Blanch chicken bones. Marinate fish slices in salt for 30 mins. Then add cornstarch water and drain water from fish after 10 mins. 
2) Shallow fry yam cut into chunks and set aside. Shallow fry seabass collar and set aside.
3) Add soybeans and sliced ginger in boiling water and simmer for 20 to 30 mins.
4) Add chicken bones, lengkuas, leeks, stem of Chinese or Napa cabbage, fried seabass collar and simmer for another 30 to 40mins.
5) Remove seabass collar and set aside on serving plate for later.
6) Sieve soup and discard residue.
7) In soup, add sour plum and fish slices. Once cooked, remove fish slices and set aside on serving plate for later.
8) In boiling soup, add Chinese or Napa cabbage, tomatoes cut into quarters, beancurd, fried yam. Add roasted fish sole powder and tung chye (pickled veg). Turn off heat and add chinese seaweed.
9) Serve soup hot with rice. 
Tip : 
1) Cook extra soup stock and freeze.
