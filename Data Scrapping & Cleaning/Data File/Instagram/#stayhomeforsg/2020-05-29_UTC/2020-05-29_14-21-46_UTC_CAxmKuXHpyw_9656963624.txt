“There are 360 degrees, so why stick to one?” – Zaha Hadid.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
A1 came to me with this quote on the page of INNOVATIVE: Bravery Magazine Issue 8 - Zaha Hadid and a protractor (haha yes I have protractors, compasses, long rulers, vernier calipers and graphing calculators in my house because I used to be a math teacher and fun fact: Zaha Hadid actually attended the American University in Beirut where she studied Math woo hoo we actually have something in common!).⁣⁣
⁣⁣
He asked me “Mummy, does she mean that instead of just looking at one degree to draw a line, we can try so many other degrees?” Whao that is just a conversation waiting to be deepen. So I stopped my stir frying midway and met him at eye level to talk to him, “Yes darling, and what do you think that means?” He said “Maybe to be creative to try many more ways rather than the same way?” We actually had a good 10 min discussion about this and it was good!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Love having such impromptu discussions with my children and love how it came up so spontaneously, from him stumbling unto the quote.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
[Additional Information] Went to research the background behind this quote by Zaha Hadid and found out that she designed the building of a unique never seen before type of ski jump at Innsbruck, Austria in 2002. She said this quote because she wanted to convey the message that architecture is meant to be looked at and enjoyed from many angles. Hadid breaks through, not only the glass ceiling, but all the barriers put up by traditional walls and floors.⁣⁣

Am so going to share the photo of the ski jump at Innsbruck, Austria that is designed by Zaha Hadid and the motivation behind the quote to A1 tomorrow!
