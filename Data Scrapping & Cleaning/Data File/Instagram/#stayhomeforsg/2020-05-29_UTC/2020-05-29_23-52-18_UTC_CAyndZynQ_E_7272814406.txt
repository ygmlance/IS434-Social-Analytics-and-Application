As the head of Special Projects of SG100 Foundation, I had initiated Project JPB with @willytankp and @abundancelifecoach. It is indeed heartening to know that there are so many people who are willing to step up and offer their resources and volunteer their time. These are the moments that made me realize that we are living in a wonderful world after all!
