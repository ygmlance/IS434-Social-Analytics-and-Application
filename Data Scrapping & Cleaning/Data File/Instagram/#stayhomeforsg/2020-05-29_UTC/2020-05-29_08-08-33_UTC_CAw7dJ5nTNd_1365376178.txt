TGIF! And dance to the heart!  Needed some dressing up to find some sanity during this #circuitbreaker.  A skirt that I wore 15 years ago and I can still fit in now! I am not auntie ok? Hahaha... Looking forward to 2 June, though still continuing to #wfh , but hope things will ease off a little and we get a little more “freedom”... jiayou!  #stayhome #stayhomestaysafe #sgunited #stayhomeforsg #ootd #positivevibes #positivity #positiveenergy #positivethinking #smile #nomakeup #nomakeupmakeup #sginstagram #sginsta #instafashion #instagram #instamood #inspiration
