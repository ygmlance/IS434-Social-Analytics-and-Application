Tried my hand at making budaejigae (army stew) on Day 53 of #CircuitBreaker 
Made my own dashi stock as the broth for the stew. All in all, it was a success and the boys enjoyed it immensely. They made me cook 2 additional packs of ramen to finish up the stew. 
Super #grateful for easy recipes that I can follow!
