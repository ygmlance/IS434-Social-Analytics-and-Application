My first food delivery this CB when it is coming to an end soon. ðŸ˜‚ Been wanting to try @sanitycoffeebar but always blessed with ample food to eat from MIL! ðŸ¤­ Got a lil excited when I saw @xianxian87 ordered and finally decided to place my order! Had wanted to try their piakssant but changed my mind when their CB limited food items are almost sold out! (Now really sold out! Heng ah! ðŸ˜Œ) After much thought, decided on the Cheese Trio & Herbs Toastie and Nestum Cereal Cookies! Luckily I requested to add tomato soup to my confirmed order! The cheese toastie tasted sooo good when dunk in! ðŸ˜‹

P.S. I was too anxious to try it cos I have a concall 1h later when it arrived. I tried the toastie without toasting it and decided to give it a quick toast and warm up my soup. Look at the stretchy cheese that is not fully melted! I reckon it would be heaven ðŸ˜‡ when I give it a good toast!

Also, I tried the CB Dorscon first from the CB Sampler Pack. U know, cos it's still Dorscon Orange, drink it while u're still in it lol.. it's not bad quite nice! It tasted like the small orange chocolate bar we used to eat when we were younger! ðŸ˜‚
