#throwback to a healthy Teochew sliced fish soup é±¼ç‰‡æ±¤ dinner after all the sinful eating ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° wanted to buy batang fish but I was late to the market so only red grouper was left ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤£ Added some thinly sliced bittergourd, tomatoes and tofu too to go with the mixed grain rice. To save some cooking time, I got the yummy fish broth from @fishsoupparadise - no MSG, and itâ€™s a great base for any seafood soup! Got it delivered straight to my place and can keep it in the freezer for a month. Looking forward to make more soup-based dishes! .
