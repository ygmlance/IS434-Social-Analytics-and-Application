It has been truly a long time since I last had such delicious bread 🍞! Super friendly owner was so nice and even gave us a free mini brioche to try. Made with premium Nippon Flour, French flour and Lescure butter, the taste really speaks for itself 😋😋

Will definitely return for the Garlic Cream Cheese Sourdough (bottom) & Himalayan Pink Salt Butter Roll (left) for sure!

FYI do reserve in advance as their bread batches are limited! And watch out for their unorthodox opening hours too.
