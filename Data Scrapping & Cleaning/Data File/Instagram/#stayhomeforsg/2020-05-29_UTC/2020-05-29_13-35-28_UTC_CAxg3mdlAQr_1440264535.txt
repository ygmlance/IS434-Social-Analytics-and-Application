<LIFE AFTER CIRCUIT BREAKER>

Some things will not change.

You will still need to retire.
You will still need to generate income. 
You will still need to do your budgeting.
You will still need to take care of your health.

If things are still not sorted by the end of CB,

We don't lack time, we lack discipline.
