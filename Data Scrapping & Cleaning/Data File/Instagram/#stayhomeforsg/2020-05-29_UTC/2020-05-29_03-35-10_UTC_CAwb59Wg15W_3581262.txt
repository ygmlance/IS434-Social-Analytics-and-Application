Recently I was inspired by a clip @tankae92 as well as I was asked by some friends why I only post photos of tea and wares with no video of brewing in action. 
So I decided to do a fast and simple video of my clumsy fat fingers doing the Chaozhou Gongfu style of brewing (潮州工夫泡) with a Dancong Tea.

Wasn’t easy to handle the phone camera with one hand while trying to complete the process within the Instagram given one-minute. Usu action will be much slower than this video (can’t hurry an old man). But again, the Chaozhou Gongfu Tea Masters “might” be telling you… “you only need one hand and please… faster… a lot more people are waiting for your cups to drink that tea!” Indeed is a fun and relaxing way to start a Friday morning.
