I usually start my day early with workout/yoga before having breakfast. Heard that there’s a difference between workout before and after food for loosing weight. It doesn’t matter to me. My focus is mainly to stay active and healthy, and by the time I finished workout, I can have breakfast with Dear (who just woke up). #stayhomeforsg #supportlocal #gratefulheart
