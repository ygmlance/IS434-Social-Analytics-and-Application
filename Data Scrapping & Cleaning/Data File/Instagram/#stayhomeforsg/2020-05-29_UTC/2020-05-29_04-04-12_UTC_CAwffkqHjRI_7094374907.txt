Many of us have held part-time positions during lengthy periods of lull; either waiting for school to begin or to be conscripted üôÉ. And I think it‚Äôs mad important because it‚Äôs only through working to earn your own pocket money do you really learn to see the value in it and the value of service staff.

Back when I was 17, I was a barista at Starbucks. It helped shape my foundation and perspective on coffee-drinking, service and just F&B on a whole. It also taught me why I shouldn‚Äôt be a dick to servers and I won‚Äôt lie, it was a great cover story when I entered poly‚Äîshoutout to the friends I used to give out free frappuccinos to.

Eventually, school began and I had to stop working for fear of flunking. Fast forward to the few months before graduation, I got the pleasure to work at @onemancoffee where I used to function as a kitchen assistant‚Äîso yes, I know how their signature bacon jam is made üòè‚Äîas well as a dishwasher and server. Not the most glamorous when it‚Äôs put like that but I‚Äôm thankful because it taught me loads.

Till today, I still have an affinity toward the cafe and though it bothers me that I don‚Äôt visit as often as I like, I always find myself feeling a sense of warm familiarity whenever I walk through those hard-swinging metallic doors. My go-to items are always their Gashouse Eggs and Flat White. Period.

Looking back, I‚Äôm glad I took on those roles both at Starbucks and OMC. So parents, get your children off Tik Tok and tell them to get a part-time job.
