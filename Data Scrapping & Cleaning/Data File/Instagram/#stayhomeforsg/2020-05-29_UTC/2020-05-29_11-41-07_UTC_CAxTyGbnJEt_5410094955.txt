Give yourself a pat on the back - staying at home for 6 weeks is no easy feat! 😣 While we look forward to restrictions being lifted real soon, there's nothing like a cold cuppa @sogurtsg froyo to keep both tantrums and tummy upsets at bay 🥰⁣

As we step into Phase 1, KARA will continue to accept orders for islandwide deliveries and takeaways! ‘Til we reopen for dine-ins again, stay strong and stay safe! We will get through this together! #SGUnited ❤️⁣
