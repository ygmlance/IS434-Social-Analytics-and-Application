Ending of this Friday's line up is Advaitha! This 17 year old local singer and songwriter is one to watch out for having released a couple of original songs under her belt. When she's not studying in school, you'll find her working on her music. Grab your favourite drink(s), a few friends (virtually) and unwind with her tonight! üçª
