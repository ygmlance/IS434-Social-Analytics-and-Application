My husband wanted to have calamari but I don’t like to fry stuff so I cooked this baked version and it tasted just as good! Paired it with baked sweet potato fries and tzatziki plus Tiger beer! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😋😋😋 #sgeats #sgfoodlover #homecookedwithlove #sgfooddiary #igsgfoodie #igsgfoodies #igsgfood #sgigfoodies #igsgfoodstagram #igsgfoods #sgfoodstagram #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfood #sghomecook #sghomecooking #singaporehomecooks #eatbooksg #sgfoodporn
