🕢Dinner:
-Thai Basil Beef
-Shrimp Omelette

I love to make International cuisine at home that tastes even better than take-out,Just like this dish, Thai basil beef,aka Pad Graw Prow is so authentic tasting you’ll feel like a true Thai Chef!

Beef version has a more intense flavor compare to chicken or pork, as the tender beef is caramelized and tossed in a delicious dark rich salty sauce with fragrant basil.

This saucy Thai dish is a speedy and easy meal that really hits the spot when you are craving for a flavourful, savoury, spicy, meaty that pairs perfectly with steamed rice
