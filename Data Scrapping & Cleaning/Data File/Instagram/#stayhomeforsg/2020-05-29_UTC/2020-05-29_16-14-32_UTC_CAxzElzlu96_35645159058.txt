Itâ€™s a little past midnight and weâ€™ve just signed off from our kitchen finishing prep work for tomorrowâ€™s orders. Hereâ€™s a fresh yuzu fruit for your viewing pleasure in case you donâ€™t know what it looks like. These babies go into our yuzu madeleines($3). Check out our stories tomorrow for more pics though we really wish you could smell them. P.S. : we are FULL this weekend, thank you for your support! ðŸ¥°ðŸ’š
All slots are still open for next week, though weâ€™ve already started to confirm weekend orders for next weekend!! Pre order to avoid a heart attack and slide into our dms to know our full menu ðŸ˜‡
