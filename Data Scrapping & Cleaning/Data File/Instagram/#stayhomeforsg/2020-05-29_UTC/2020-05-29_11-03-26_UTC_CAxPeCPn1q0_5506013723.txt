Because we stay at home a lot, there are opportunities to try new recipes! Some are ok.. like this chicken Schnitzel while others not too successful.. see pic 2 galette complete.. we can't fold the galette, it was too thick ðŸ˜… anyway help yourselves.. it's #friendsfriesfriday!! ðŸ’ž #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithascott
