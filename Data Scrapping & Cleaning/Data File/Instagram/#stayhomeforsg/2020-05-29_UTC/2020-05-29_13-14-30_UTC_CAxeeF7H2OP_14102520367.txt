When Chicken meets Thai! 🐔🇹🇭 My dinner is food delivery from @shaoparadise!

The roasted chicken has a smoky roasted flavour which I kinda like, however the meat is to the drier side. While the poached chicken is soft & tender, soaked with the flavourful soya sauce! The rice is fragrant and soft.

The chilli has a taste of lime, garlic and a very fragrant flavour. Asked the owner & they shared that they added a secret ingredient - Thai Flowers.

Their sides added another 💋 to the rating! The yummy dumplings are wrapped with pork, prawns & chestnut, small and bite size, I can just keep on having it. The thai tofu sauce is appetizing & the marinated lava eggs makes this chicken rice meal different from usual.

This chicken rice shop is managed by a 70 year old uncle with a Thai-Chinese wife, hence their dishes have some flavours from Thailand too! They do their own deliveries. Free islandwide delivery above $60, you can order via WhatsApp at 97697868.
