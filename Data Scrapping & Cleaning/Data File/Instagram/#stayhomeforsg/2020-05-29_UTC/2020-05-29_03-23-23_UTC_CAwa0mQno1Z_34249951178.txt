Pupusa a.k.a the National Dish of El Salvador!
.
Tried my hand on Latin American cuisine, Mexican in this case. Corn flatbread stuffed with cheese, refried beans, and meat (I used pork) served with a tangy salvadoran cabbage relish! Wow wow wow!! Tastes phenomenal!
.
The KEY ingredient was Masa Harina - white maize flour I got from @lamexicana_sg !  It gives the pupusas a fluffy mouthfeel and a crispy texture! Just wonderful!
.
Very happy with the result from my first attempt at pupusas from scratch. ðŸ¤­
.
@lamexicana_sg and @andrea.ruizval what do you guys think?ðŸ™ˆ
