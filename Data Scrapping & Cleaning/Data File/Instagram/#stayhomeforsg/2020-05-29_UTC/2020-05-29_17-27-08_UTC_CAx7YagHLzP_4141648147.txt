I relished the challenge to shoot for a PB for my 2.4km fitness run. My PB was set when i was an innocent 14 year old boy. I thought the world of it when i scored that PB. I knew I could go faster. I was still in recovery from the race of my life (that’s another PB story). 26 years on... I still think that i can improve on my 2.4km PB. The past 30 days have the most focused effort to better the PB.After 30 days, I didnt manage to. But I’m not discouraged, because I know that with another 30, 60 days of focused training. I will be able to do it!

On a consolatory note, at 40 years old, 22 years of cancer sticks, 6 years of alcoholism. I think i fared decent at 09:40 for a 2.4km.
