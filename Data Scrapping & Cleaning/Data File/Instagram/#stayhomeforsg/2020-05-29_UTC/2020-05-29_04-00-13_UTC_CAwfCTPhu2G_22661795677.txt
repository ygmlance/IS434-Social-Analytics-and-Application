Fridays should be celebrated even with #circuitbreaker! Woohoooo spend your TGIF with us as we bring on two very talented local musicians. At 9pm, Dominic Chin brings you through his originals featuring his upcoming single, Better! We then have Advaitha who will be wrapping up the night at 10pm. Don't forget to get your drink(s) and your friends to complete the night.

Tune in from 9pm-10.30pm via CR8 Studio SG on Facebook or head to our Instagram link-in-bio! Set your alarmsðŸ¤˜ . ----
