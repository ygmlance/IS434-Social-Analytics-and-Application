Iâ€™m on leave from work and kitchen today! 
How many of you agree even when weâ€™re working from home ... we still  need some off days??? So, donâ€™t forget to take your leave! 
Give your mind and body some rest and tender loving care despite this uncertainty.
Our mind is everything!!!
Rest to give it a reboot ... spend some me-time ...
. . .
Tuna Salad again .... I couldnâ€™t describe how wonderful & refreshing this bowl is with the #kumquat eo, evoo and acv dressing + unripe persimmon, guava and lettuce ðŸ˜‹
