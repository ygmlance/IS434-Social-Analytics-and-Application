Original : 'Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus' Helen H. Lemmel, 1922⁣
Remake : 'Turn Your Eyes', Sovereign Grace Music, 2019⁣
⁣
Just 4 lines. That's the sum total of the original song. ⁣
⁣
I always did feel there was more to be said, that there was more to the song, and now there is. Sovereign Grace has sensitively and gracefully expanded the original 4 lines into a full narrative of fixing our gaze upwards and beyond.⁣
⁣
Jesus, to You we lift our eyes⁣
Jesus, our glory and our prize⁣
We adore You, behold You, our Savior ever true⁣
Oh Jesus, we turn our eyes to You⁣
⁣
The best thing about this remake is that it feels organic. The expansion feels like a seamless outgrowth of the original, a natural extension. ⁣
⁣
It's also worth noting that triple time (which the song is in) is quite a restricting rhythmic framework to work within. As such, remakes often change the time signature to quadruple time, so there is literally more time to play with. Sovereign Grace didn't, and still managed to produce something praiseworthy. ⁣
