Using Tension for Good

In this writing studio, ten people came together to explore and share about the tensions felt during COVID-19, through an object of choice (e.g. a ball of thread signifying relationships, or a face mask representing necessities).

“I have done self-reflection and I got the answers to the questions asked!!! I know that more tension is good in pushing me to meet my deadlines and continue learning. However, less tension is also good so that I don't think too much about how others view me, especially if I do not live up to their expectations. At my age, others’ views should not bother me anymore.  As long as I have tried my best, that's good enough. - Participant, 50
