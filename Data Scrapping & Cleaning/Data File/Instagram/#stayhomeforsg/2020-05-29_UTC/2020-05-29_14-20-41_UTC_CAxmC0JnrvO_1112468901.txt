#TGIF!!! There I was minding my own boring business with #stayhomeforsg and then I get a message saying that I will be getting a #surprise delivery!!!! Omg!!! #ilovesurprises 😍. Happiness is when you get your favourite #thaimilktea from #tuktukcha. Still refreshingly cold and so #yummy. So why did I get this? @jae_jae4eva said she “wanted to #brightenyourday and let you know you are missed”. Aww 🥰... thank you #thankyouforbeingafriend, an awesome friend. Love you so much... #circuitbreaker #grabdelivery #surprisepresent #drinkstagram #thankfulgratefulblessed
