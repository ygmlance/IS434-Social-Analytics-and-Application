Super stoked to be on the youth panel for World Oceans Day alongside some incredible folks. Do also check out their amazing work at @youngnautilus, @ourseas.ourlegacy and @nparksbuzz. Join us for the discussion at go.gov.sg/wod8june and keep your night free! Thanks @cheopeirong for organising this!
