Although our struggles may not be universal, but we are in this together, and we are almost through the circuit breaker!

We gathered our #MissUniverseSingapore sisters to join in the #passthebrushchallenge with messages to inspire and keep you going once things start to slowly reopen. These are some messages that kept us hopeful, and we hope it may do the same for you. There will be many new normals moving forward, but we are strong, we are resilient. We are #SGunited. ❤️❤️❤️
