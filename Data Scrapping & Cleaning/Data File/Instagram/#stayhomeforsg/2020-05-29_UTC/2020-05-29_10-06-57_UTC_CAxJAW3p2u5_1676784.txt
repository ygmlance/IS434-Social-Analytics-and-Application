Staying home & having the privilege of time to clock in more workout sessions + cooking lessons. I write this note knowing that not everyone has this chance to do so - Especially those working at the frontline, migrant workers and those who do not have the privilege to work from home like we do. With the added stress from being more at risk, to those infected by the virus and those seriously affected by the drop in income - It‚Äôs a seriously difficult time. Along with #SGUnited, #WeAreMajulah and #HomeButNotAloneSG, we call for notes of encouragement to those in need in any way you can. It could be a social media posting like this or a written note pasted on your door to thank those who deliver your parcels & meals to you. A small gesture would go a long way. üå∑ Let‚Äôs take a minute out of our day to encourage someone, especially in this time. Hope everyone is safe and well! Here‚Äôs some clouds to lift your spirits as well x ü§ç‚òÅÔ∏è ‚ú® #StayHomeforSG
