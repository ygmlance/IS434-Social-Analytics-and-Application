How many of you, like me, change into your workout clothes first thing in the morning on your workout days even if your workout is scheduled later in the day? Changed and all ready to ace my workout later today - Leg Day! Have a blessed Friday, a great workout and an awesome weekend ahead. Stay safe and healthy everyone. #tgif #fridaymotivation #fitnessmotivation #homeworkout #exercisingathome #corcuitbreakersg #stayhomeforsg #workingoutfromhome #healthandfitnessjourney #healthandfitness #fitmoms #fitnessmoms #fitmomlife #fitmomlifestyle #stayhealthyandfit #fitnessaddict #gymmotivation #gymlife #homelife #covid19 #survivingcovid19 #gaugegirltraining #healthandfitnessgoals #ectomorph #strengthtrainingforwomen #legday #momwholifts #strongnotskinny #strongisbeautiful #getstronger
