Whilst some of you are starting to make plans for your return back to the workplace, this is certainly a look you can take into the office on “casual fridays”. A simple basic white shirt and jeans, is the perfect classic casual look which can be totally dressed up ready for the office or even to head quickly into the grocery store looking trés chic!
