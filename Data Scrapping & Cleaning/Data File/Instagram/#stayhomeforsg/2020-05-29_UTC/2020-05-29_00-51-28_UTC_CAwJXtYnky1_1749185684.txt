#7daythighchallenge with #blogilates

OMG.. Did up a countdown back to school for the kids and realised it is also back to school for me too.. Worried.. Anxious.. So many things to do but never do. Ops. I also wanna spend more time with these little kids as they won't be little anymore.. #parentingdilemma 
I hope I can still do my workouts but most likely after school or not, wake up at 5am to do! 
2 days left on the challenge! Can't wait for it to end! Haha.. And should I cut my hair short or leave it long? Bangs or no bangs? Poll on IG stories?
