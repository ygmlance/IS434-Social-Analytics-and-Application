Before bed time, we explored number bond of 3 again and the book titled: "ABCs of Singapore" which features some of Singapore's fave hawker food such as satay, through short stories. 
It consists of decodable words that can be read phonetically. It was through this book that my girl read about Ang Ku Kueh (a sweet dessert), tasted it (yeah I bought some for her to try) and fell in love with it!! 🤩💓 1️⃣ We shaped playdough into "beef and chicken satay balls". 2️⃣ We explored different permutation of the number bond of 3, such as 2 chicken balls and 1 beef ball = 3 balls, and so on and so forth. Then thread the meat balls into the skewers. 
3️⃣ Thereafter, the kid grilled the satay skewers and dipped them into peanut sauce and paired them with Ketupat rice! Yummilicious! 🤭 Okay so this was my "secret Math lesson"! ☑️☑️☑️ Checked.
