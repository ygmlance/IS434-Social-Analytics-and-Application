Don’t all cheong next week and waste a good CB and the billions spent to help us through this outbreak.  We also waste the breather #nature was gifted during lockdown if we try to play catch up with our #business and #social activities.

We could move to Phase Two of the reopening before end June if community transmission rates remain low. We must be prepared for #life not to return to status quo, and to enter into a #newnormal in Phase Three. 
Let’s all take responsibility to ensure that health and safety measures are in place. Then use this opportunity to sustain our decreased consumption and restart with a commitment to help #Earth recover.
