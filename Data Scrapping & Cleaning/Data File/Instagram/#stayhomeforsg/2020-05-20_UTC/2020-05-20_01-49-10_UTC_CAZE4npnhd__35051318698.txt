Throwback.
Book: The very busy spider by Eric Carle. 
The kid learned about a spider spinning a web and a fly landed on the web, which became a meal for the spider. 
Today we used this book as our inspiration to make some spiders etc using the playdough.
From the activity, she learned that a spider has 8 legs etc. 
She also made an orange fish with a green tail and some monsters. She did some counting of the monsters' eyes etc to correspond to the wooden numbers I gave her (1-1 correspondence). #jiareadbooks
