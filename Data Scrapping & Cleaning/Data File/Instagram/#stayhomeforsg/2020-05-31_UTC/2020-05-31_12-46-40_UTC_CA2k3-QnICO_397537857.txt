Who doesn't like crispy butter Cereal Prawnsü¶ê? Made a plate piled with mountain of cereal cos it's always not enough. Pardon the messy plate though üòÖ

Next dish is steamed Okra drizzled with Soya Sauce, Sesame Oil & Lauganma. Yes, finally managed to replenish mine today.

Lastly Potato Omelette.

Enjoy your #dinner too!
