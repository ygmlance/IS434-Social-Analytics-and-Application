Was suppose to make beef ribs stew but I poured in too much water and it become beef ribs soup. Nevertheless, it still tasted so yummy. Ribs were so soft and tender because I cooked it using @ninjakitchensg multi cooker. 🌟🌟⁣

First, blanched the beef to remove the impurities from the ribs and bring it to boil together with garlic, leek and onions. Drain the ingredients and leave the beef stock aside for later use 🥕🥕

Set Ninja Foodi to sauté mode to stir fry the meat, add in all the sauces, potatoes and carrots. I used mirin, bulgogi sauce, sugar, sesame oil, @honeymillsg Clover honey and @liloikanbilis mushroom powder. Stir fry till fragrant and add in the beef stock and a cup of water. Set it to pressure mode and cook it for around 30mins 🕜✨💯✨ #beefribsoup ⁣
