#ScenicSunday
We are going short on pics. But thankfully the circuit breaker ends day after. Not that we will just pick up the gear to click pics but atleast we would like to have that option very much.

This pic was clicked in our hometown, nearby our house. Good old memories my husband has of playing cricket on the field nearby. Things we took for granted will no more be granted. To the new normal that is waiting for us day after.
