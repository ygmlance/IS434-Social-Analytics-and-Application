Made Fuzhou fried oyster cakes 炸蠔饼 today. I was told that they are called ‘tie biang’ in the Fuzhou dialect, which is literally translated into ‘wok cakes’. .
.
.
These UFO-looking 🛸 cakes are made of a batter comprising all purpose flour, rice flour and blended soya beans, and filled with minced pork and prawns, bean sprouts and of course, OYSTERS! 🦪 .
.
.
The first time I had these was back in 2007 from a stall at Maxwell market. It was so good that I was blown away at first bite! 🤤 .
.
.
After that first try, I would always eat this whenever I visited Maxwell market, which is once in a long time. Have been thinking about making these for some time but never gotten down to it coz there’s so much work involved!
.
.
.
Anyway, I have finally gotten down to making them and am loving these babies! 😍

These fried oyster cakes are a vanishing street snacks which are hardly seen these days. I’m glad that I have learned to make yet another traditional dish today. #gratitudediary
