#homemadepizza by the #minichef at home during this #stayhomeforsg #homecooked #meatballpizza Cheated using the #selfraisingflour #water and a dash of #oliveoil for the #dough Then spreading the #pregotomatosauce around the flattened dough. Next come laying all the #shreddedmozzarella all over before the #meatballs are spread out. #choppedonions are also scattered. Finally a layer of the shredded #parmagianoreggiano from @merryberryland before popping in the oven at 400F for 15 mins. When done, sprinkle with the same #parmagiano and serve!!
