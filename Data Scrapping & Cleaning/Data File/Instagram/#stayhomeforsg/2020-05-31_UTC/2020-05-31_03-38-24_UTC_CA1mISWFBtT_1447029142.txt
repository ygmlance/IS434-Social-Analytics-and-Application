[Recipe] Airfried scones!!! 🌻🌻
My Sunday brekkie!! Super easy and fast recipe!! 🇬🇧 Thks my sister @mediocre_mae who is anything but mediocre' for the recipe!! 😉
Never knew scones can be easy to make.. No rubbing in butter etc 🤪
Without a doubt my airfryer is the most used appliance in my kitchen.
My girls only like plain ones without raisins etc.
And as you can see my Teochew hub wants to hv his with kaya. Fine with me!! I had mine with @alcenerosg blueberry jam 😍 and butter.
I made 12 mini ones and 2 big ones.
