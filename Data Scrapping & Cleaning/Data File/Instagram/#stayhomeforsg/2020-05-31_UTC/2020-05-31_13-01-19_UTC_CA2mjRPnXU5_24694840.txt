Trying out assam fish for the first time using tioman fish fillet. Taste almost similar to tze char assam curry fish head! And the tioman fish is very meaty and didn't flake into bits and pieces. It's a super easy 1 pot dish that goes well with rice, BUT...I still have to cook non-spicy dishes for the kids in case they can't stomach this. I'm sure many mothers out there who love spicy food like me can totally relate to this.
