Fancy some “rocket science”? This video from Kids STOP Singapore demonstrates how to use paper and straws to make slingshot rockets (yes, adult supervision needed!). Use them to discover the physics of potential energy, and see whose rockets fly farthest. Bonus points if anyone can explain how the different types of potential energy are converted into kinetic energy.
