Recipe for wholemeal bread : 
https://tasteasianfood.com/whole-wheat-bread/

Notes to recipe, my adaptation :
1) I missed out adding tangzhong at autolyse as recipe had missed out typo. Added tangzhong only after autolyse, mixed in using hands. Then cut dough in food processor. ( Didn't have a food processor so did in 2 batches in my bender cum grinder, adding half the cold butter cut into small pieces in each. Pulse for about 1 min. Didn't reach windowpane stage. ðŸ˜¥ ). Bread still soft but perhaps might be softer if added before autolyse since proofing is 2 hrs at autolyse. 
2) To learn autolyse technique, refer to video @autumn.kitchen IG post dated 27 Mar 2020. 
3) 1st proof 2 hrs. 2nd proof 1 hr. 3rd proof 15mins, 4th proof 1 hr. 
4) I greased my pullman tins with oil. 
5) After egg wash, I sprinkled oats on top, closed lid of pullman tins and baked for 30 mins as my bread was not so high. 
6) Doubled recipe which yield 2 x 450g pullman loaves which measures 21cm x 12 cm or about 8 in x 5 in but only 2/3 of height tin. Even though loaves didn't reach full height of tins, it didn't create mountain top whilst baking. Had nice pullman loaf flat top. 
Tip : 
1) Use clean disposable shower caps as cover for proofing dough. Its size fits even wide bowls plus elastic bands make it easy to remove and cover back, when checking on dough and for multiple proofing. Can write proof timings on it too for easy reference. Swipe to video on 5th. #showercaprecycle
