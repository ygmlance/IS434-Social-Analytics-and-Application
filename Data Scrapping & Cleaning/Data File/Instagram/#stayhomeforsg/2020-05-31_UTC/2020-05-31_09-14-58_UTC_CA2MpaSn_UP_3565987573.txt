Tasted @haritts_singapore #donuts for the first time and... I love it! The donuts are #fluffy and #soft but yet gives you that density that makes biting into one so satisfying! I just love their #pistachio donuts and regret not getting more! There is so much pistachio filling in the #donut (itâ€™s the white one in the pic). I also ordered #Chocolate (the dark brown one in the pic), cream cheese, limone, cinnamon raisin and #maoshanwang #durian ! #yum Perfect #snack to go with a cuppa #nespresso with #homemade #oatmilk ! #delish #stayhome #sgunited
