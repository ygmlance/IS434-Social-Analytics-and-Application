🕢Dinner: Local favourite | Curry Laksa 🍜

Laksa is a dish that appears in our lists of local must-eats favourites.A bowl of curry laksa can only deliciously shine with the help of spicy coconut-based soup, which is the soul of this Peranakan dish.

My curry laksa made easy with  @dancingchef_sg laksa premix , topped with fishcakes, prawns and tofu puff, bean sprouts and thick vermicelli (bee hoon noodles), definitely a distinctive noodle soup that will tickle the tastebuds.

Remember not to scrimp on the sambal!
That salty,rich and creamy broth in every mouth.

oh man, it’s so delicious. slurp!
Let’s Jiak !
