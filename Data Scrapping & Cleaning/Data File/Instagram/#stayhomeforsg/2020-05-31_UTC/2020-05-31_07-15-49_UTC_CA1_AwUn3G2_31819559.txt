🇸🇬 Coming to an end of the 2nd month of lockdown. Might be another 1 more month before everyone is able to meet up with their friends and loved ones.

This cb period 简直是闷到发慌。Somehow didn't feel well rested.🤷🏻‍♀️ Hardly went out of house, nothing much to do at home, and laptop crashed almost 2 weeks ago. 没电脑的日子更无聊了。😪 Sigh, can't wait for life to return to normal. Meanwhile, enjoy my series of my #viewfromhome.
Hope everyone is well.

Till then.
