全民抗疫，宅家之际，新加坡晋江会馆一群青年隔空携手，创作了一首闽南语歌曲《明仔早日头相像光》，向医护人员致敬，鼓励国人携手抗疫，也希望为新加坡佛教施诊所筹集善款。 《明仔早日头相像光》由晋江会馆执委朱海滨作词，晋江会馆青年团团员林浜娘作曲。歌曲以医护人员和被隔离者的爱人为视角，唱出虽然命途坎坷，但是心心相连就一定能战胜困难的主题。

喜欢我们的歌就请捐款给新加坡佛教施诊所！

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented impact on global economy and people's livelihoods. The road to recovery will be long and hard. 
Our Youth Group has composed a Hokkien song 《明仔早日头相像光》 to pay tribute to the frontline workers fighting Covid-19. We also want to encourage people to help each other and move forward without fear, just like how our forebears had built Singapore together.

Through this song, we also hope to raise fund for Singapore Buddhist Free Clinic (SBFC), a charity that need more support during this trying period.

If you like our song, donate to SBFC!
