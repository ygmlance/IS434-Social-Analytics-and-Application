What gives you the most SATAY-faction from this dish?

For me, itâ€™s the peanut sauce! You canâ€™t compromise the peanut sauce! Itâ€™s everything!!! We can finish up the peanut sauce alone after all the satays, so yes, it gotta be good right! 
Okay, maybe Iâ€™m too biased. Satay should be the star ya? Itâ€™s the name of the dish after all ðŸ˜‚ (actually I quite like the cucumber after everything, itâ€™s refreshing)

Where in Singapore has good satay? Iâ€™m looking for it! Please share!!
