Spending almost the whole day eating away at home.
Wake up in the morning to cook Salmon fillet Mee Sua.
Something wrong with my phone camera. Bad luck sia. Photos were deleted. Left with one on the last pic. The Mee Sua was cooked with two hard boil eggs and dome some vegetables. You will have to imagine yourselves ðŸ˜Š
After the Mee Sua I was snacking on these cute mini peach buns with lotus paste.
Was lucky to get the cold ones yesterday. Sometimes they were sold out. The big  one need to order. See pic. 
The aunty even give me some steaming paper for steaming,  very nice and thoughtful. Otherwise they will stick to the plate.
Very nice. I eat three only as I have other dim sum to snacks.
