If you are in the mood to celebrate the last day of May 2020 in this new evolving world with some hybrid-eating, then @artichoke_sg sweets in our Szechuan inspired menu is right up your alley 🤙🏻
.
This week, our house-made donuts are glazed with #Kumquat icing, dressed with a scatter of candied orange peel and a heap of mango pearls.
.
The donut is available as part of the Deli Set Meal for 2, or add-ons for $5 each and half a dozen at $25.
