Sharing my recipe for these Brownie Crinkle Cookies, a recipe you do not want to miss 😋! These are crispy on the outside and brownie-like on the inside 🍫! Add a dash of sea salt for a nice balance of saltiness and decadence!
.
My family is a huge fan of these! Apart from being addictively delicious, they serve as a good topping for several cold desserts too ☺️. Also huge thank you to the person who recommended me to try this out!
.
As per usual, the recipe can be found in my blog, link in bio! Wishing y’all all to be safe and healthy at home 😋!
