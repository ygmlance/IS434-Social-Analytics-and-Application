We just spent a cosy #StayHome Saturday night over a virtual Whisky pairing, with a group of Whisky lovers out there!â €
â €
Hosted by Glenfiddich's SEA Ambassador, Brett Bayly, and in collaboration with @Sethluicious and @Glenfiddichwhisky, participants were introduced to three different whisky flavours - 12YO, 15YO and 18YO, to go along with a three-course meal prepared by Spice Brasserie and Si Chuan Dou Hua Restaurant. â €
â €
It was a great experience and opportunity to share the joys of dining at home, especially during this period. Hereâ€™s to the last weekend of Circuit Breaker. Cheers! ðŸ¥ƒâ €
