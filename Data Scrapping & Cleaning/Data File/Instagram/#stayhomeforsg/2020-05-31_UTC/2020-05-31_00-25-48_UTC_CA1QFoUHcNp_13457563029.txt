My relationship with this book was love at first sight. I love rhymes, and I was so thrilled when I found a collection of these to read to my children.
.
ðŸŒ¿ My favourite part of this book, is interestingly, the introduction. I love how Jim Trelease expressed our deep connection with poetry - that the first poem a child hears is the rhythmic beating of his motherâ€™s heart. I couldnâ€™t put it better in words than Trelease, all the benefits of reading to your child - the imagination, the connection and the explosion in language.
.
The poems are grouped into themes and the themes so relatable to the lives of young children.
.
ðŸŒ¿ The watercolour illustrations and pencil sketches are reminiscent of old-school textbooks, and that, strangely adds a nostalgic charm to this book.
.
ðŸ•Š With the themes so close to a childâ€™s heart, this book is what defines childrenâ€™s literature. And it definitely has a well-deserved spot in your reading nook.
.
Look out for my stories where Iâ€™ll do a quick preview of this book.
