This is @beckster_xi adapting the airturn (new trick she learnt just last week) together with previous tricks (learnt over the course of 6 lessons) all on her own! She has progressed so much! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Here's what she feels about the lessons👇🏼 'Learning how to play the asalato from Madeline is a great joy for me! She gives clear advice and follows up well on homework she allocates, making the learning process efficient and fruitful for my learning style. Her lesson plans have structure and are progressive in nature, and she reminds us to keep the fundamental motions always. 
I look forward to learning more from her!'
