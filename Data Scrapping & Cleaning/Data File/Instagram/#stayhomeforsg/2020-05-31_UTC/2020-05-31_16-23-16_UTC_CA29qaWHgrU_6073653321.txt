Mee Rubus, Chinese style. As u can see, the typical Chinese in us included fishballs n prawns to the local hawker delight.😂The MR was made using none other than our fave @primataste premix sauce ($6.30). The gravy was 💯 perfect even tho this was the first time we tried the variant. I would definitely stock up on the premix sauce in my next grocery run.🌟 <CBDay55> #sgfood #meerubus #homemade #stayhomeforsg #jiakpahpah #tiramisooojiaks #jiakjiakjiak #jinhojiak ✔️✔️✔️
