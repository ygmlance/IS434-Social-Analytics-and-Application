DAY 54 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
(countdown ... 2 days to go)
Stuffed Pumpkin

A simple dish of pumpkin, macaroni and mince beef, but looks fancy only because its served in the pumpkin shell. I scooped put the pumpkin, seasoned it with salt, pepper & olive oil. Baked it in the oven for 15 min at 170°C
Stuffed it with macaroni in pasta sauce, cream, cheese, and mince beef. 
Baked again for 10 min st 190°C .
