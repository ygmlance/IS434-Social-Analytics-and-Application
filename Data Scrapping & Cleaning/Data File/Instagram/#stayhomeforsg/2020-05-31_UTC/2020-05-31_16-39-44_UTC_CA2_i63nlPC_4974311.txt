[28.05.20] Day 52 of #circuitbreaker:

This circuit breaker has been most fruitful for the cub. Not only did he show us how well he manages his schedule of online enrichment classes on his own, he would ensure he does his mom-based-learning work before he starts playing. To reward him, we sent him for MORE online classes - two rounds of coding camps..at his request!
