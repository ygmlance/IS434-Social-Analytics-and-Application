Bought the cast iron grilled pan from @lecreusetsg long time ago but i haven't got chance to grill meats yet ðŸ˜…

Tested it with grill sandwiches, and we felt in love with it! The golden-brown crust is just amazing good. Who doesn't like it??! .

Enjoy your weekend and bonding time with your kids before they going back to sch next week. Happy Sunday!! ðŸ˜Š
