C.B. Day 55 - 1 more day to Phase 1
Favourite scramble eggs with bacon again for brunch.

Nice and fluffy with melted cheese and a tinge of Italian Herb for taste. â™¥
The best comfort breakfast / brunch. And yes, I lovee lovee loveee British scrambled eggs Gordon Ramsay's style more than Americans. Best eaten anytime anyday.
If there are sauntee mushrooms, roasted tomatoes and chai latte, it will be prefect. ðŸ¤¤ Maybe next time.
