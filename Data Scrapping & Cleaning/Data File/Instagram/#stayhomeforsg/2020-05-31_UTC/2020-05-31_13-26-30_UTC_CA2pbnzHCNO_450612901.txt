Baking fun with the gal today... let her try and make Little Bear muffins and decorate it like @littlemissbento ...super easy baking and definitely a good fun activity for the kids. Supposed to make 8 muffins but the daddy couldnâ€™t wait for the decoration and simply pop one into his mouth already and getting huge cries of dismay from the gal after that... the muffins taste good too! #bakingfun #bakingwiththeprincess #bakingkit #littlemissbento #littlemissbentobakingkit #bakeribakingkit #littlebearmuffins #stayhome #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithascott #bakeri #bakerisingapore #jamieleecooks #homecook #homebake #circuitbreakerday55 @bakerisingapore
