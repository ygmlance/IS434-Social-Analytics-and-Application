The last I picked up my brush and painted 🎨at home was in 2018, the last bread 🍞I baked was in 2017, the last cheesecake 🍰 I made was in 2019, the last I bun my hair and workout from home: yesterday ✌️ ✨Voilà, I managed to do all these in the last 2 months! ✨

This #circuitbreaker has given me a chance to spend more time at home with my family and above all, a chance for me to go back to my hobbies which I haven't had time for recently. 
Ok, that's all for May 2020!
