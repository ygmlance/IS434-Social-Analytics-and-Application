[CLOSED] 🌈G|I|V|E|A|W|A|Y with Colour Me Mats🌈
.
Ash loves colouring with twist crayons and I recently introduced markers to her. A great way to introduce colouring with markers is through @colourmemats. Colouring on silicone mats saves lots of ink and loads of paper. Simply colour, wipe and then colour again!

@colourmemats‘ mats 🌈 are BPA-free and made of premium food grade silicone with FDA and SGS certification. The mat could be used as a dining mat as it is designed with raised edges around the border to guide young children to colour within the mats and contain any dining messes and spills. The surface of the mat is buttery smooth for easy cleaning with wet wipes.

I love how the pictures on the mats are educational and tell a story. Ash learned about the 4 seasons and creatures under the sea from coloring on @colourmemats. I’ve yet to unleash the classic stories one like Goldilocks and the Three Bears and the fantasy theme one. Little girls would definitely love the Magical Unicorns and Fairies puzzle mats.

Colouring helps children practise and develop skills such as concentration, fine motor and coordination for early writing skills and correct finger grip. Even as an adult, I couldn’t help myself and got carried away colouring when Ash was sleeping. 🤣 Colouring is a great therapy for adults too.

@colourmemats is lovingly created by 2 local mummies who love picture books and strongly believe in minimising screen time for their children. I love supporting local and together, we are gifting 2 lucky follower $40 store credits.
