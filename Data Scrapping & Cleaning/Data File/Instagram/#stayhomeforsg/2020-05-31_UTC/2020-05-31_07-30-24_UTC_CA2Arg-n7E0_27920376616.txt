Yay the shipment is here! Thank you for waiting guys! All the May orders have been despatched & the courier will be knocking on your door real soon ðŸ˜Š

Friends awaiting for June shipment, just awhile more ok, the bubble masks are on the way, super duper freshly made and out of the oven! Those who are keen, faster PM to chope it! ðŸ˜œ It's a Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ formulated product. Support local!

And Paco wasn't too happy when I was packing the masks cos I took up too much space and he's annoyed lol. Petty dog!
