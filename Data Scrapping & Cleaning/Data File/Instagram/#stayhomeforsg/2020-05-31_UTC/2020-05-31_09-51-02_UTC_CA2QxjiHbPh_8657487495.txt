The  idea of the Wish Box Trial, comes to me naturally.
â€¢
If you already had the experience of shopping at Whish Paris, you know how much I love when you try everything. How many times did some of you choose a jewel, that you didnâ€™t even pay attention to before? 
I want you to feel the joy of shopping again and trying everything on.
â€¢
The process is easy :
â€¢
You tell me what kind of jewelry you are looking for, I prepare you a Wish Box full of wonders. It will be free and contactless delivered the same day.
â€¢
During 24 hours your can try all the layering, ask to your gang or your Mom.ðŸ˜‰
â€¢
I would be happy to be involved in the process to help you choosing the perfect pieces, through
â€¢
The Wish Box comes with all of what is needed. Itâ€™s never be so simple to spoil yourself, or your love ones.
Returning the Wish Trial box is easy and free, a delivery man will come to pick the left over jewels, if any. :) After returning, all the jewels will be disinfected.
The payment by Paynow or transfert.
