Just like that, 55 days have gone by and we can’t believe how quickly time has passed since the start of the #circuitbreaker. While we wait eagerly for the arrival of Phase 2 (when dine-in service can resume), you can still have a little chocolate therapy now with this deeply rich and chocolatey cake, alongside a hot cuppa.
⠀
So any time a chocolate craving strikes, you can pick up a slice of this Belgium Chocolate cake from our outlets or order via GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo. Island-wide delivery (link in bio) is also available with minimum order of $25. While stocks last. #supportlocalsg #loveyourlocalsg
