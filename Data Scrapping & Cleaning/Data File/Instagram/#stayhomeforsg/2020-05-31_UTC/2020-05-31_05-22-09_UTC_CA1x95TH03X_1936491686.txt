WE MADE IT! As we draw a close to the COVID-19 circuit breaker, we hope everyone is safe and healthy, and slowly easing into the #newnorm. 
During this period, our teachers and students stayed connected through the use of technology. At first, virtual learning sounded daunting and impossible to us due to the lack of physical interaction, but with the strong support and understanding from parents, we transited our music lessons to online learning! We are happy to see our students enjoy their remote learning, and continue to improve their playing techniques; but above all, we are immensely proud of how they managed to balance between home-based learning and music lessons.

Let's continue to do our part to stay resilient and overcome this together as a nation. See you soon!
