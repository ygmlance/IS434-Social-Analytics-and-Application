Sorting our groceries from @thecareservices. It’s heartening to hear of new online grocery stores sprouting in midst of the current situation, where we are all encouraged to stay home. Even if it means doing our groceries shopping online. With new online grocery store, it translates to more delivery slots.

We carted out our vegetables consumption for the coming week. The Care’s vegetables are locally sourced and purchased at wholesale market the day before. Not kept in bulk. There’s also a good range of organic vegetables fresh from the soil, which is only harvested the day before delivery.

We had some other dry goods that were carted out too. For June, they’ll be doing a free delivery with $50 min purchase. Use Code: YAYONEMONTH upon checkout. It’s available throughout June! Cart out before 5.30pm for next day delivery. Stay tune too, on their account for weekly giveaways coming up!
