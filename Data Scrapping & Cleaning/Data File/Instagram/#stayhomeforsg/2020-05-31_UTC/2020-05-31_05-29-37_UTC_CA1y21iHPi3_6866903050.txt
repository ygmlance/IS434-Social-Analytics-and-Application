Thought to have a easy one dish Sunday but I was wrong. The time taken to do this outweighs the efforts. #salmonpie from the #salmonfillet from the good people at @apollomarineseafood Thanks @gerlee for arranging the delivery. Anyway, ingredients are pretty simple #salmon #brusselpotatoes #onions #sourcream #mozarella Boil the potatoes and smash it. Leave some cubes potatoes for final mixing to achieve the texture. Mix the half cooked salmon with onion into the mashed potato adding sour cream and the cheese slowly for the #piefilling For the crust, I used standard #flour #butter #water and lay them on a tray. Finally, cover up the pie and brush with eggs and finally bake at 200 for 35 mins. #yumz #homecooked #stayhomeforsg Promocode if you want to buy apolloxec
