In the morning of #WorldNoTobaccoDay 2020, our P1 son was happy and thankful that there was no secondhand smoke entering our HDB home. He naively thought that smokers gave themselves and the affected neighbours a break from tobacco. In the afternoon, he was rushing to close our windows and I could tell from his face that he was disappointed. Thus, my young gentleman who dreams of a #smokefreeSG, wrote again a heartfelt appeal to smokers (https://www.instagram.com/p/CA2btmrg0IS/), with tears (literally, thinking of his late grandfather who passed away from #lungcancer though he never smoked in his entire life), pain on his thumb's (#writerscallus #writersbump) and prayers for the smokers and affected non-smokers worldwide. I told him to take a break, but he pressed on to write, after all the smokers did not give us any break! He asked a lot of questions: Who invented #cigarettes? | Why were cigarettes invented? | Why do people keep smoking though they know that it is bad for their health? #ThankYouDoctors #ThankYouScientists for letting us know about the adverse health effects of #smoking #secondhandsmoke #thirdhandsmoke! | Why is there World No Tobacco day? https://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/previous/en/ "I hope that everyday is No Tobacco day!" | If there is no more cigarette factory, can the factory workers earn a living for their family?  After all, machines have reduced the number of required workers (https://www.vox.com/2015/3/18/8243707/cigarette-rolling-machines), these workers could re-train to work in other sectors. Indeed, everyone of us has to learn, unlearn (e.g. the smoking habit), re-learn to survive.  #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #TobaccoExposed #WorldNoTobaccoDay #DearCovid19SG https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
