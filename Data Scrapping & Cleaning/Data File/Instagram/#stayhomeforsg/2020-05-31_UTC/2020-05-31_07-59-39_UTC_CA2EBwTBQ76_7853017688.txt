We are excited to announce that our paragon outlet will reopen for take away orders and island-wide delivery this week!

Starting June 2, orders can be placed for pick up through phone call, or delivery from GrabFood and FoodPanda. Island-wide delivery can be placed via colonialclub.oddle.me

Walk in takeaway orders are welcomed too! Patrons can wait for their orders in the restaurant where safe social distancing practices will be enforced. We look forward to serving you again ❤️ .
