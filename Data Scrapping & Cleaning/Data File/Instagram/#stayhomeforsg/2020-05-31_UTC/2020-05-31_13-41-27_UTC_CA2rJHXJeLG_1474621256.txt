Did you pick up any new skills during the #circuitbreaker period? #NTUsg NIE student Ng Wen Xin (@ngwenxin) discovered that she could turn her photos into digital art using the Procreate app on her iPad. “I got my friends to send me images of their family, friends, places and moments they are missing right now so I could help turn those into drawings. Over time, I got gradually better at it. I learnt to add more details and pay attention to how clothes should flow to make these digital drawings more realistic,” she says.
