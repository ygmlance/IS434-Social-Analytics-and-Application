30 May 2020 | Day 54: FB Video Call Party. 🥳🎉
Let’s try something new today. Felicia is in Aus and decided to logon to DJ Chris LIVE stream and dance together over FB video call with me. Unfortunately, Leeloo is pretty judgemental when Felicia started dancing… But that’s alright, that was just few minutes of madness. 🤣

PS: 3 hours later, we heard our names... check out on the next video. Thanks DJ Chris, we had our fun, despite the disapproval of Leeloo. 🤣
