Rainy Day calls for Fish Head Steamboat.

I'm loving the sweetness & richness of this big pot of Fish Head Steamboat. This milky broth includes plum and fried sole fish which enhanced the flavours. You can choose your ingredients for the pot, I chose red garoupa, tofu, cabbage & seaweed! Yummy fresh ingredients they had!

I've also ordered their Salted Egg Yolk Prawns & Seafood Fried Rice too! .

They're currently offering FREE Islandwide Delivery for orders with a min spend of $50. Pick up your orders to get up to 15% off.
