After 2 months of desperately trying to grow our own starter, the hubby has finally baked his first sourdough from scratch!! R.I.P. Breadley Cooper, Bready Gaga, John and Jane Dough, and Walter Wheat ðŸ˜‚ TQ @chauweiru for being our bread benefactor when we couldnâ€™t find the right flour or get starter(ed), and hello to the miracle that is Wheatney Houston - what a way to round up our last #circuitbreaker weekend!!
