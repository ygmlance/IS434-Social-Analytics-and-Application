One of the MUST HAVES to keep kids occupied at home  are these reusable colouring mats.
.
This time Avery and Hayleigh were occupied colouring all the Emergency and construction vehicles after reading books about all of them. .
They then gained interest and started taking their brother’a toy emergency and construction vehicles out to play as well.
.
One theme but different types of play ☺️. .
Use code “SHAUFUN” for 10% of @colourmemats. They have party packs too, perfect for birthday celebrations when kids go back to school 😊
