#circuitbreakerday55 Nespresso days at home, and my little Starbucks stainless steel mug collection. â˜•ðŸ¤© Top 2 from Japan, middle 2 from China and bottom 2 from Singapore. My first cup - the one that sparked this collection - was from @ctql2003 when she went to Starbucks Portugal, and is in the office.
