CB Day 55: 31st May 2020. Tenth takeaway during CB is from The Communal Place. Food not often consumed by the parents - steak, baked miso salmon, linguine with foie gras and of cos Kronenbourg Blanc. After CB I think I need to go for health checkup. ðŸ¤£#sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgfoodpics #foodpics #foodpic #whati8today #supportlocal #supportlocalbusiness #sgunited #circuitbreaker #lockdown #stayathome #strongtogether #stayhomeforsg #sgrestaurant #thecommunalplace #thecommunalplacesg #steak #steakdinner #salmon #bakedsalmon #misosalmon #linguine #foiegras
