✌️2 More days to "Safe Re-Opening".
. 
Today I tried to see how fast I could run and how long I could maintain it comfortably. After warming up for 1km,  I pushed as fast as I could for the next km. I felt challenged to complete 1km at that pace. I was even more surprised to know my average fastest pace was 5:28 per km from that run. 😮
.
It "seems easy" that many could leisurely run at this pace over long distances. It's even more amazing that the fastest marathon runner clocked an average of 2:54 per km!! "It's marathon, not a sprint" is a very misleading quote from this exercise. 🤯
.
I guess I'm still very much a beginner 😊
