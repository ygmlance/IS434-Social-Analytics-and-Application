Day 27 Hols = Day 55 of #circuitbreakersg 
Leg Slimming Pilates workout 
#7daythighchallenge with #blogilates
Full Body Stretch and Recovery with #heatherrobertsoncom 
The last day of the 7 Day Thigh Challenge and so happy I made it through. Managed to keep my leg up for the 2nd workout and I'm surprised at my legs.. Why is there a great difference between my thigh size? (will post next the results) Probably cos of my knee injury many years back, the muscle atrophy is still there but its now 2 to 3cm different! 
Will post my reflection on the challenge later.. Meanwhile, trying to put myself with Cassey here! 
Enjoy the video.. And it's my rest day so I did #heatherrobertsoncom 7th day of the full body stretch and recovery too.. So good to stretch! 
Enjoy your Sunday!
