Today’s lunch requires a lot of endurance and self discipline... the hardest part of making this lobster roll is to de-shell it and to resist the temptation of simply eating the lobster meat... end result was a blast! Lobster 🦞 crunchy coupled with a soft crisp bread 🍞. We were all delighted with today’s lunch #lobsterroll #lobster #jamieleecooks #homemade #stayhome #stayhomeforsg #stayhomewithascott #lobsterlunch #🦞#龙虾 #龙虾面包 #bakeri #bakeribrochehotdogbread #homecook #bakeri @bakerisingapore #circuitbreakerday55
