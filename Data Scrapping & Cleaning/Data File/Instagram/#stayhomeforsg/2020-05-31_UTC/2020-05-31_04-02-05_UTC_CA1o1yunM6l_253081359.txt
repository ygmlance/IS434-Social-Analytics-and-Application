Dressed up to go to the kitchen for coffee. 🤪Been staying home for 56 days now. and Never once stepped out of home and have no intention to because one less person out on the streets is one lesser risk posed. 💪🏻
Took this opportunity to wear everything I wouldn’t put together when I head out because it would invite too many stares and awful comments, in a country where the mass dresses very subtly. I find myself always struggling to dress down and tone down on loud pieces just to not invite too much attention. Some would argue “if you choose to dress so loudly and be fat at the same time, people would definitely stare at you!” True, because I find myself staring at good-looking people, well-dressed people, and loud people too. Not in a bad way but it’s human nature to give attention to something eye-catching, whether it is pleasant or not. Don’t you agree?
Also revealing my very crowded kitchen for the first time ever. We have a microwave, air fryer, coffee machine, bread toaster, the regular stove, pans and pots, but we don’t have a rice cooker. Are you shocked? Hahaha
