For those who want to continue reading... Here are some facts about our food.

Award-winning recipe using traditional bake cooking method to obtain flavours that come in layers of its own. Starting with pork and rich robust pungent flavour of petite cloves garlic. That time-honoured combination of soya sauce, ginger, black pepper along with yummy noodles immerse in scrumptious secret blend broth and fresh king tiger prawns. Finally rounded off with plenty of vegetables like coriander roots/stems, spring onions, all crisp and succulent. It takes a little while longer than usual resulting in an ultimate combination taste we call it Flavour Of The Sea.
