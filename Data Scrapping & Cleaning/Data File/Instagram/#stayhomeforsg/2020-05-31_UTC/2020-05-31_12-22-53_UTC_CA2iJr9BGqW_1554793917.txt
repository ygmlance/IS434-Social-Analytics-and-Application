IT’S A WRAP! Thank you @humanlibrarysg for yet another amazing reading session. This comfortable space sharing platform which #hlsg has created, plays an important role in creating Endometriosis awareness. Made even more comfortable now with their online sessions (checkout behind the scene short clip at the end of this post) ! It was certainly a fulfilling Sunday. Looking forward to many more sharing sessions 😄🙌🏻 #posthospitalisation #stage4endometriosis #endo #endowarrior #endometriosis #e4endo #chronicpain #chronicillness #chronicfatigue #brainfog #sgfitness #fitwithendo #endobelly #endobloat #endohusband #adenomyosis #endometriosisawareness
