Saw @lobenstringquartet played this song and realised it has 2 titles. One is an instrumental version called Gabriel's Oboe. Another is Nella Fantasia which i browsed at Sarah Brightman and angelic Jackie Evancho's cover. Here is my first attempt at singing and playing this, a short extract. The high note is a killerðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
Saw the translation of the lyrics and loved the meaning behind it.

In My Fantasy

In my imagination I see a fair world,

Everyone lives in peace and in honesty there.

I dream of souls that are always free,

Like the clouds that fly,

Full of humanity in the depths of the soul.

In my imagination I see a bright world,

Even the night is less dark there.

I dream of souls that are always free,

Like clouds that fly. 
In my imagination there exists a warm wind,

That breathes on the cities, like a friend.

I dream of souls that are always free,

Like clouds that fly,

Full of humanity in the depths of the soul.
