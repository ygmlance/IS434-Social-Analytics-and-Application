The highlight of some football matches can be the down to the tactical setup of both teams. The Classic 442, the offensive 433 and today's hottest 4231. These formations and tactics can often decide the result of a football match. 
As football players, it is good to know how to play some basic formations, and today we are going to explore the classic 442. Even Cristiano Ronaldo started as a winger under this traditional 442 before progressing to the more complex formations.

Coach Azmir is going to walk you through the three levels of this formation. See if you can keep up and apply them to your own game and teams when live football games and soccer matches start again in Singapore.
