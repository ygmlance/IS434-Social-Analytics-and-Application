I thought I would try something new and let you see the behind-the-scenes of a doodle this time. I never know what the end result will be whenever I doodle 😅 so I did mess up a little but it was very quick and therapeutic. .

As a child growing up, I saw the world in words - does anyone else do this? I had a hard time learning Mandarin (English was so much easier for me). I would often remember a Chinese word by imagining what it looked like as images in my head. Only recently, many years later, have I begun to really appreciate the beauty of the language. Fun fact: did you know many Chinese characters first began as pictograms? .

let me know if you think I should try more of these! .
