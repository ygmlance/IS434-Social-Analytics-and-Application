How many oranges you have ate during this CB? Keep all the skin to make enzymes washing detergent.
Reuse the Cny cookie container, fill up 50% orange skin (chopped), 10% brown sugar, and fill up to 90% full of water. Keep for minimum 3 months. Occasionally give it a good shake. Darin and use the liquid as washing detergent. You can use directly or mix with some Commerical detergent to have the soapy touch.
