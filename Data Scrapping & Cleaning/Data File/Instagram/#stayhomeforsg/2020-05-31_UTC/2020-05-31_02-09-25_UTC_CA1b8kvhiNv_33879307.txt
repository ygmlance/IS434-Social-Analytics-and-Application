Team Shroom or Team Chick? Still a tough one, though Shroom is a winner for me with those melty cheese and portobello mushroom!

#circuitbreaker doesnâ€™t stop us from having @shakeshacksg at home. Had satisfying lunch complete with Crinkle Cut Fries and Coffee Shake. Recommend for coffee addicts like me to get this Shake, since the joe is from Common Man Coffee.
