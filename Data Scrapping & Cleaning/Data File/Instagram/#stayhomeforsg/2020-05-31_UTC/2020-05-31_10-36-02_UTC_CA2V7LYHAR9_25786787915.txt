During this CB period, it does get tiring to whip up meals, while handling the kids, household and juggling a full-time job. What better way to save time, entertain the kids, teach them some useful skills, expose them to traditional/ not-so-common local food, while still filling everyone’s tummies. The best thing about this do-it-yourself kit is you can cook it at any time, and it can be as messy or as neat as you want it to be. This kueh pie tee kit from @mrpopiahsg includes everything you require to start off (eveything in the pic is included, except for the prawns). It is even delicious in the process, while being convenient! I am very pleased with the result of this food activity, as it ticked off many boxes in 1 fell swoop. The taste was traditional enough and hit quite close to home. It’s the specal tangy garlicky sauce (and crisp!) that really meet the mark, even without chilli! Need to get this for CNY next year!  #stayhomeactivity #stayhomeforsg #kidsactivity #nofussfoodforkids #convenientfood #3kids4wheelsactivity
