Baked focaccia again, tried a different recipe and attempted a #gardenfocaccia
Recipe for focaccia:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/let-the-bread-bloom
While bread has a good texture like the previous recipe from @kitchenandcraft
adapted recipe to follow comprehensive steps from #kitchenandcraft
1) Shaped dough by pinching dough method as dough is sticky.
2) Followed by folding method 3 times at around 10 to 15 mins interval. Do 20 mins if have time. Then cover for 1st proof.
3) The following tips from recipe are useful to note.
A) Soak the vegetables for topping on focaccia such as parsley, spring onions in lemon water to retain green colour after baking. Prevents from turning black.
B) Use thicker cuts of vegetables to create the topping on focaccia as they shrivel during baking.

Notes to recipe, my adaptation :
1) 1st proof 2 hrs. 2nd proof 40 mins. 3rd proof 30 mins.
2) After 2nd proof, and stretching dough to fit pan, dough couldn't stretch to corners of pan. Rest dough covered for 10 mins and it was easy to stretch to corners. 
3) After 2nd proof of 40 mins, wet fingers with water and make dimples all over dough. 
4) After 3rd proof of 30 mins, dough is ready if fill up about 2/3 height of pan, has bubbles and slightly wobbly when shake pan from side to side.
5) Recipe states to pre heat oven to 230 deg C then turn down to 200 deg C when placing focaccia in oven. Focaccia still rather pale as 200 deg C insufficient to brown the top of focaccia. If bake for at 200 deg C  for 30 to 40 mins as stated in recipe, the base becomes too crusty. Recommend to bake at 230 deg C for ard 20 mins to get slightly crisp edges and soft fluffy interior .
6) Doubled recipe to get 2 rectangle pans, 1 big and 1 smaller.
