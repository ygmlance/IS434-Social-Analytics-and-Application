Braised noodles for dinner! 🍜
✨
Our first try preparing lor mee from scratch. We used pork tenderloin instead of pork belly for a healthier option, and added barramundi flakes using barramundi portion from @kuhlbarra, braised eggs and bean sprouts. Love how flavourful the dish turned out to be. Served with garlic purée and Mum’s homemade chilli. Plus add on some soon kueh from Lai Heng Handmade Teochew Kueh. Simple but delicious! 😋
