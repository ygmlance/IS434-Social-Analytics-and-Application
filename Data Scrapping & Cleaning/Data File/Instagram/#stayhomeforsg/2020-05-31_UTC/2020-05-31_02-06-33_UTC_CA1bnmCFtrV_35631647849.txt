“The group and peer sharing is a great way to share different perspectives and resolutions to a situation. There are more than one way to solve a problem. Looking at things from a different angle, using different methods and even drawing them out can result in different outcomes. Drawing them out also calms the mind and heart.” – Puay Eng, Participant
