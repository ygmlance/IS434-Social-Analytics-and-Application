Came across a deal yesterday at Old Chang Kee ðŸ¥³
It only cost about ~S$30.00 for everything (both pics) and was a great deal. This is suitable for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks or even supper (practically anytime of the day)! ðŸ˜‹
Do try out their signature curry puffs! ðŸ˜œ
Among these, I like their curry puff and chicken wing the most.
Definitely a good and worthy buy for the day! 
Have a good sunday and week ahead folks! ðŸ¤©
