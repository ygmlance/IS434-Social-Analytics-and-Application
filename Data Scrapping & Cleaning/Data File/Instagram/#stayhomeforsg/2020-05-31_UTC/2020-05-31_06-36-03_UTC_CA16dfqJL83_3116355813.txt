How have you been keeping yourself occupied this circuit breaker period?

Our SBPWA members have been up to a variety of interesting things. Check out whatâ€™s our members are up to while they #stayathomestaysafe and get inspired!

Long-time member Vivien Chiam is coordinating a project to sew masks for young children. ðŸ˜· These masks are hand-sewn by volunteers from the Women's Committee to help children stay protected while they are outdoors.

Let us know what you have been up to, and if you've managed to hit any of the personal goals you've set for yourself!
