My Japanese-style hotel breakfast, eaten at the comfort of my own living room. During my travel to Japan, will usually have one of these breakfast sets provided by the hotel before setting out to explore the place. Here i am sipping my black coffee and watching an unconventional jap drama "Panda judges the world". I'm watching it because the title caught my attention! Ha!
