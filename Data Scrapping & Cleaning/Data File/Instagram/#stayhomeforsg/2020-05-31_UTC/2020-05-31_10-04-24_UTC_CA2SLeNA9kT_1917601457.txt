“I love HBL, but I love you more!” Teachers from North Vista Primary School received a sweet surprise from their students in the holidays. The teachers earlier recorded a video to cheer their students on during the holidays, and were very touched when a group of parents from a P2 class responded by creating their own video, which you see here. 
Mrs Jeffrey Keo, one of the parents who initiated the project, says, “The teachers have put in so much effort and love for our children throughout the Circuit Breaker period. They had to familiarise themselves with the online tools quickly and ensure our kids can learn at the right pace during HBL, while tending to their own families! We want our kids to show appreciation as well.” As Term 3 draws nearer, share this with a teacher you know – and let them know they matter!
