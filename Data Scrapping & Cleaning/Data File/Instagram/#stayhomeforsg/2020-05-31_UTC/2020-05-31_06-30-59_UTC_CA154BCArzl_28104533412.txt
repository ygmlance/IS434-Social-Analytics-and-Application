Afternoon to you all üëã had to share this quote from Eric Feng which resonates very much with me. I believe too it will resonate with you in some ways

Success have many different meaning to different people. Its not just about attaining wealth, prosperity or fame. To me, I believe family love & support is the most significant factor on how far I have come & learned much in every journey of life, on account of the fact that family is the first learning place and it is an economic and emotional supports for individuals.

Self love ‚ù£Ô∏è is the essence of all love, as this is where you truly begin to cultivate kindness and compassion. And as the saying goes, "You must love yourself before you can love anyone else" ... No doubt that to some of you, self love is hard. Focus on liking yourself as a baby step.

With this love, subtly provide the support and having a positive impact on the lives of people by uplifting them and inspiring them to think and act in ways that they may not have considered before ü§ó

Have a good weekend! and prepare for the little kiddos of ours to head back to school!
