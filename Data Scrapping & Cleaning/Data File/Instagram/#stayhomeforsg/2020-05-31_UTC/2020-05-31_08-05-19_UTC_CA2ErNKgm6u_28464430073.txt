healthcare workers 👩🏼‍⚕️
we are very appreciative 🥰 towards our frontline workers for battling this tough fight for us! our healthcare workers stand in the front line of our defences and we owe them a great debt. 🤗 they were away from their loved ones to protect us and the least we could do is a big smile and a heartfelt "thank you"! 🥺

migrant workers 🔨
they are a huge part of the workforce in singapore 🇸🇬 and they play an important role, leaving their homes 🏡 to help build ours. they have been badly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and we hope that you were able to show care 💞  towards them!

and last but not least, you! 👉👉thank you so much for being understanding, cooperative and responsible citizens by staying hone as much as possible during this Circuit Breaker phase! thanks to your efforts, the rate of community transmission of the disease has been reduced. thank you for playing your part! 
let's pull through this together! 😚 till next time! 🙆🏼
