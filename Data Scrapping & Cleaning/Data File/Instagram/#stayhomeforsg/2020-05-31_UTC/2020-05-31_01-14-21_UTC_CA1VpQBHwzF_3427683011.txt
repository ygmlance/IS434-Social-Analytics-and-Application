How our pass or plating area looks today! These are unprecedented times and we thank you for your support in the past two months of our two charity takeout - with @foodbanksg and @healthservesg.  We are grateful for the opportunity to feed you at home and to be able to continue working during this period.
.
We will continue our takeout possibly into the next few months into uncharted waters. Starting from June, takeout is available for lunch and dinner on Thu, Fri, Sat and Sun. We will be adding a few new items and single diner friendly meals in our menu which would be great for lunch whether youâ€™re returning to work in the office or working from home.
.
Details will be announced next week.
.
Stay strong, stay well and stay safe!
