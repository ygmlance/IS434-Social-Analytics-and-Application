We bickered for half an hour on whether I was allowed to make a tuna melt, cause “tuna mayo’s only nice when it’s super duper cold!!!” he says. Our compromise: I can toast the bread alone without anything slapped on it 🙃 bye bye #cheesepull. I’m sure most families have their own take on “The Best Tuna Mayo”, god knows my mum has a well-guarded egg mayo recipe like that; but L said I should share his recipe since I’m posting a photo of his sandwich. Fair enough, can’t argue with that 🤷🏻‍♀️ #CEBcooks

INGREDIENTS (makes 4 sandwiches)
2 cans tuna
1/3 cup mayo
1/2 onion, diced
2 pickles, diced
1/4 wedge lime, squeezed
2 chilli padi, sliced 
1.5 tsp mustard
Salt and pepper, to taste
-
Slices of bread (I use @crownbakery’s brioche)
Cheese
.
1. Mix the ingredients for the tuna mayo in a bowl, season to taste, and chill for at least an hour (he insists) before eating. You can use regular dill pickles here — I used some homemade pickled carrot and cucumber I had left. 
2. Heat a little oil in your pan over medium low heat, then place your bread in the pan. Let it soak up the oil, crisp and brown up. I’m doing the fried bread I love here, but feel free to make your toast with butter instead if you prefer that. 
3. Take the bread off the pan. Place a slice of cheese on the grilled side of one slice of bread, and spread the tuna mayo on top. Place the other slice on, with the grilled side down against the tuna. 
4. Heat more oil over the pan and grill the sandwich on both sides till it’s beautifully golden AND the cheese melts. Now enjoy the true blue tuna melt I never had for me 😌
