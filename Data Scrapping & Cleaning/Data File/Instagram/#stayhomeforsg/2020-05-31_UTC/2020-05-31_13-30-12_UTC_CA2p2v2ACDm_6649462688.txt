My son wanted to go on a treasure hunt, only this time he didn’t want leaves but real bird eggs. We walked with our heads high up looking out for nests. I knew it would be tough to spot nests but I wanted to just let him have hope. Finally we spotted bulbuls on a tree with fruits all over the ground. He said to me - these could be eggs. So we built a nest ourselves and protected these eggs. He wanted to stay there and watch them hatch and I just didn’t have to heart to break his bubble. We spent quiet moments beside our nest on the lookout for birds, and spotted starlings, woodpeckers, orioles and hornbills. Nature play is so rewarding, as much for an adult as it is for a child. 55th #ajoyaday #lockdown #singaporecircuitbreaker #covid19 #singapore #stayhomeforSG #natureplay #kids
