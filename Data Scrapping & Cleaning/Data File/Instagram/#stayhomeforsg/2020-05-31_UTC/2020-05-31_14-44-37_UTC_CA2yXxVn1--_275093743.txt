Posted about this on day 15 of CB. 
Today, on Day 55 of #CircuitBreaker, we put in the final piece of puzzle and completed this family project.

Although I call this a CB family project, it was really the boys who did most of the work. I’m glad I got the boys to work on a puzzle because through the process, I witnessed the boys’ patience and perseverance in completing it. I’m very proud of them.

Needless to say, they are thrilled with the result. #Grateful to have done this with them.
