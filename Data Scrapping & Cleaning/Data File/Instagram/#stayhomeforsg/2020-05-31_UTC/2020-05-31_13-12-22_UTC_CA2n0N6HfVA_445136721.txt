This weekend’s sweet treats - peanut, red bean and yam angkukuehs from @theakkhut 😍 Ordered them 2 weeks ago after getting to know about their long waitlist from @alainlicious’ post! 😆My favourite flavour was yam - which had small cubes of yam within the paste. I steamed them for 5 minutes the next day and the mochi skin was still soft. 👍🏻
