What a hot day it has been and we very much in need for something fiery like a curry dish to whet the appetite and boost the mood. Decided to cook up a Thai curry with prawns and lychees for tonightâ€™s dinner as it has the perfect balance of heat, savoury and sweetness. Comfort food like this is exactly what we needed for day 13 of circuit breaker and Mr K is happily lapping up the gravy.
