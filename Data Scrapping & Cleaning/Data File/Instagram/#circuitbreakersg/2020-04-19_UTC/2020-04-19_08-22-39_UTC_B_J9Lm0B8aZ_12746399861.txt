18th April 2020 Still have a lot of Koh Samui footage to edit but just can't bring myself in the mood to continue. We are 10 days through our one month Circuit Breaker. Since it is still legal to go out buy food, go out we did. Typically on a Saturday night the city would be bustling with numerous social activities. Last night was eerily quiet. On the bright side it proves most of us are taking #stayhome seriously. This too shall pass, let's hope it'll pass quickly.
