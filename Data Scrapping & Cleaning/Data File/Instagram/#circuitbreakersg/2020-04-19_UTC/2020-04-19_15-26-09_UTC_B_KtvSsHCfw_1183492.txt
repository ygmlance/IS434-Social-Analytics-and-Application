CB Day 12
Today was supposed to be a special day at Amo. But circumstances put everything on hold indefinitely. So to make up for it, we had Amo deliver us  dinner! Excuse me while i feast in my jammies. For this dinner, i will not look at my phone for half an hour. A real treat considering my phone has been going bonkers non-stop for the past 2 weeks because of work. Not complaining cos it also means i get to keep my job. Haha
