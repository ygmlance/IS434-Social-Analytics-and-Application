These vanilla flavoured cupcakes, decorated to look like my favourite Sesame Street character, Cookie Monster 🍪💙 It's easy to make and loved by all ages! No crazy piping of fur or drawing for the eyes. Lucky my girl and hubby find it cute and tasty (tried my best liao 🤦‍♀️😅) #momwhodontbake

Using @ninjakitchensg #ninjafoodiop300 to bake these muffins 💙 Set 180°C for 15 mins for each batch. (6 cupcakes for each batch)
