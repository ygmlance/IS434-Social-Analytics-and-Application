With the end of the Circuit Breaker on June 1st, I'm sure there are people who are excited to see their friends and family again despite the continued measures. Just remember that while the stay-home orders have officially gone, the virus still stays! Do your best to keep our safety bubble sustainable everyone, stay safe ❤️ #coronavirus #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #singapore
