Day 54 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (30 May 2020) - Too lazy to cook, my #nofilter #easypeasy #dinnerforone was just some Greek-style #yogurt with #apple #leftover #blueberries and caramalized #walnuts from this afternoon's making of the #lemoncurd #marscapone #tarts topped with a dollop of the curd. Surprisingly quite tasty and filling. #stayhomestaysafe
