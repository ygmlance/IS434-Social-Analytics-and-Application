Circuit breaker Day 54: Guzman y Gomez (& a bowl from The Daily Cut) 👍👍 My fav item to order from GYG is probably their burrito bowl - always tastes hearty, & the simple type of yum. Their small portion is just right. Only downside of takeaway from GYG is the lack of cilantro, which is free flow if you were to eat in store (I love cilantro😅). Quesadillas somehow tasted more like soft tacos. Still no quesadillas can beat Muchachos.
