Nasi Tumpeng & Sambal Goreng Pete
â€¢
Lots of improvement needed but Iâ€™m so proud of myself that I made this Indonesian celebratory dishes from scratch. Perkedel and kering tempe are not pictured here. My CB personal challenge is to cook different dishes everyday and it is not complete without this dish ðŸ’•My crazy spicy chilli blend made it into this dish also.

Supermarket near us are so small so they donâ€™t have much stuff, so when I saw these beans I definitely get really excited and grab all of the last stocks. Ev hate this stinky beans but I believe he likes the taste. Since it is a circuit breaker it is a great time to eat all of this Pete beans ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
