🇸🇬 CB Ends -3 Days: I love it when it’s dark, sweet, spicy and comes in a complete mess. (加黑加辣!)

Finally having my fried carrot cake fix during this CB. No, I am not as talented as some who cooked their own dish at home. I just queued patiently behind approx 15 pax for my turn. During #circuitbreakersg, the famous hawker stalls will always have their own supporters, no need digital delivery platform, sponsored social media posts or fancy marketing. You want to get your favorite #hawkerfood fix, join the queue. Period. .
.
And respect to our hardworking hawkers who are cooking in warm humid conditions with their masks on 😷. Thanks for everyone who helps to feed us during this lockdown. 🙇🏻‍♀️ 😘 .
