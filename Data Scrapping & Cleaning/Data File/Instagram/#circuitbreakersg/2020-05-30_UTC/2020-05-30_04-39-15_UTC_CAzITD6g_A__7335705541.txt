Only 3 days to go and @osteopathichealthcare re-opens for business on TUESDAY 2 JUNE! 🎉🎉🎉
By now, many of you who haven't been looking after your postures may already feel the effects through the shoulder, upper back and chest region.  Our fantastic osteopath, David Farrelly @paddlingosteo.singapore, will demonstrate a chest/pectoral stretch which may be helpful for bad posture.  Please do not do this stretch if you have instability (eg. recurrent dislocations) of the shoulder and consult your osteopath for advice.
Chest/pectoral Stretch
• Standing in line with the doorframe
• Place one arm with the elbow at 90 degrees as shown in the images against the doorframe.  You may also stretch both sides at the same time by placing the other arm against the doorframe.
• Keep your body straight and upright
• Step one foot forward slowly and lean gently forward
• Hold the stretch for 15 seconds
• Repeat 4 times on each side
