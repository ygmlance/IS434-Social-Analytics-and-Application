Day 53 of circuit breaker (29/5/2020).
.
Received a surprise letter from a dear friend (chose not to be named). And so cute my friend typed the words by a typewriter!!!
.
Appreciate and thankful for the kind thoughts and effort to send me some teabags especially for the night after hearing I didn't manage to sleep well due to headache and others. Blessed! 🥰🙏🍵
