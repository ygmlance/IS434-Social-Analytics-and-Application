Good Saturday morning to you! For Day 54, our pretty papers are these lovely jumbo designs that I have just sent out 😍 What are your plans for this weekend? I need to get ready for school because we start on Tuesday 😱 so I’m getting my lesson plans ready and taking out clothes to be ironed (haven’t done that for months), but I’ve also done other things like packing wet wipes, tissues, and allll the pretty reusable face masks I’ve ordered during this circuit breaker! School will be very different, but it will be nice to be back and to see the kiddos. What about you—how will your life be like when we exit into Phase 1 on Tuesday? #circuitbreakersg #moneypacket #moneyenvelopes
