Got curious about sketchnoting after attending an enneagram workshop where @junemagicmarkers sat in as an visual note-taker (tbh, I thought the visuals were taken off the net initially cos' they were so amazing), and so yep, I decided to find out more about it and give it a shot! 😆

Thank you @emily_a_mills for giving a superb and easy-to-follow breakdown of the steps on YouTube too! 💌

I can't visualise myself doing lecture note-taking in real-time, but here's my experiential note-taking attempt, which was inspired from my workout routines this circuit breaker. 🏃‍♀️
