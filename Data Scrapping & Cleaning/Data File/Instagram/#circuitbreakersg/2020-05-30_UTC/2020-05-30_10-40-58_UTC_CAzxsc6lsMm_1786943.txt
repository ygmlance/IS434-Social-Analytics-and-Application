I don't know what happened to these eggs but they didn't turn out right but in the end I just put them (or what's left of them) on the toast cos I didn't want to waste food. ⁣

Considering this was my first time slicing avocado I think it looks pretty decent haha. I spread some herb cream cheese on top of @desem_bakery 's Black Rice Sourdough, and placed the sliced avocados on top along with the smoked salmon and some cherry tomatoes. Some almonds and black pepper as well.
