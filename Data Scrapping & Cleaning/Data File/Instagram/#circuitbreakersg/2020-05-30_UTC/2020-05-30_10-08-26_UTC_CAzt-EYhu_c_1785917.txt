Summary of what Iâ€™ve done in the past 1+ month.
ğŸ¦ 
Worked from home. FaceTime everyday. Netflix every free moment. Watched many live streams. Ordered all kinds of food from all over the island. Shopped like crazy online. Travelled virtually via travel vlogs and blogs. Tried to be a deejay and a singer. Completed a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.

One day, things will get back to normal. One day.
