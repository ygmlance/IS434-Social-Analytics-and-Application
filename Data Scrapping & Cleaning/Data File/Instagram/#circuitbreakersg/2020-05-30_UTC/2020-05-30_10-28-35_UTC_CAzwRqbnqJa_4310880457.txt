@nytimes @unesco @bbcnews @unhumanrightscouncil. @msnbc @spcasingapore @humanesociety  After a hectic and busy week, Iâ€™m grateful for great hair and a very relaxing last weekend of the #Singapore circuit breaker with my loyal and protective buddy Max. Thanks to all who keep us together and safe. Took off my mask for these photos btw. Just for a nano second though. Oops! Say cheese. #CircuitBreakerSG #MaxnificentMax#Healthy
