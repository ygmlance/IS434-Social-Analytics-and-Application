~ Funtoastic Saturdays ~ The little girl wants to go picnic today. So here it is, our  virtual picnic! A truffle butter toast topped with their favourite snacks of dried fruits from greenday and babybel cheese. It's funny how they finally accepted the cheese after 3 tries. Also the bakery uncle recognised me as the dessert maker even with my mask on! I took the chance to show him my weekly creations. Happy weekend! #simletseat #funtoastic #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecooking #healthykidsfood #creativekidsfood #instafood #toast #thicktoast #truffle #greendaysnacks #babybel #cheese #sgmummy #sgmummyblogger #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
