Attempted to make my own version of macdonald’s breakfast wrap this morning. I added #rosemary and #thyme meat patty, #cheddar #scrambledeggs and a generous squeeze of #mustard and #ketchup in the onion and chives wrap and then zhng-ed it up with some #avocado slices and a huge pinch of black pepper. Macdonalds adds the #hashbrowns inside the wrap but I like mine on the side. The entire family agreed that I won macs on this one..yums!!😋👩🏻‍🍳 #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
