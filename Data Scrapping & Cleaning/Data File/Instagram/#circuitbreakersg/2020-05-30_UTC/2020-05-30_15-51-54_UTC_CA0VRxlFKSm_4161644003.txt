Day 54 of Circuit Breaker - Have fun with farm animals!

Sing a song â€œOld MacDonald has a farm E-I-E-I-O And on that farm he had a cow, a rooster, a pig, a sheep, a duck and a donkey E-I-E-I-O... Cadence can take all the animals to us except donkey when we sing until the particular animal. She is learning through play everyday. No stress but a lot of fun!
