👩‍🍳MUNCH AT HOME👩‍🍳
Been eyeing on this chinese flower rolls “花卷” recipe for quite some time and so we were thrilled to finally get our hands on some yeast, yes!!!!💃 Did two renditions of the steamed rolls - Original and Black Sesame. The black sesame filling makes it more suited to be an afternoon snack and we kept the original flower rolls for dinner. Stir fry some meat strips with sweet bean paste and it goes really well with the original rolls, reminiscent of this Chinese restaurant that we used to frequent when we were younger🥰 Will definitely try to tweak the recipe more and improve on this💪🏻
