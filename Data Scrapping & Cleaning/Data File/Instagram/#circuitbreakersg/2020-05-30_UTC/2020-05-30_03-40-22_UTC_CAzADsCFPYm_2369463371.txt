This is for all of us who celebrated our birthdays during #circuitbreakerSG . ðŸŽ‚ .

It takes a circuit breaker for us to enrol the boys for music lessons. We chanced upon @musearts.sg Facebook page and opted to rent their roll-up pianos and sign up for weekly lessons. Classes are kept small and the kidsâ€™ music teacher is great at engaging the kids. We also searched for simple music scores online and Ari has been self-learning how to play them. We even tried out the @simplypiano_by_joytunes app that has been popping up in our feeds everywhere but we have not decided if itâ€™s worth paying for the full feature. .

If you have tips on how else our kids can learn to play the piano or keyboard, weâ€™ll be happy to hear them. Next instrument that I will like them to learn - kompang!
