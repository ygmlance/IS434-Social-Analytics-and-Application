I would defo be making more skewers! They are so cute and easy to make. And they make my dining plates a lil’ more interesting to look at 😂 these are #teriyaki prawn skewers. I zng the sauce using soya sauce, sugar, sushi vinegar and water. Drizzle a few sesame seeds for a bit more texture. I also skewered cucumber 🥒 to mute the sharp taste from the onions 🧅 the rest of the food is also easy to make: inari and the standard sushi rolls 🍣 and a random temaki 😂
