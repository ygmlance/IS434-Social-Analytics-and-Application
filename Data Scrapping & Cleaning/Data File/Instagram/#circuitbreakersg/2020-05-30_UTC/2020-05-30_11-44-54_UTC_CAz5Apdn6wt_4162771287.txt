Day 54 of circuit breaker (30/5/2020).
.
Thought of the day 💬🗨🗯💭.
.
While I was waiting for the 5pm service to start, I looked out from my window and saw the cloud and an image came to mind.
.
Is like a person spreading out both hands to praise, worship and pray with total surrender! A timely reminder that though we watch online service in our own comfort of our home, we are to totally surrender, seek and immerse in His presence! .
.
And a powerful sermon shared by Pastor Bobby with 4 pointers on how we should respond to Holy Spirit.
1. Be Sensitive 
2. Be Personal 
3. Be Urgent 
4. Be Surrendered .

And indeed I thank the Lord that my worship and prayer to Him today has let me sensed His tangible presence deeper and I teared and said "God, I miss You!" 🙏❤
