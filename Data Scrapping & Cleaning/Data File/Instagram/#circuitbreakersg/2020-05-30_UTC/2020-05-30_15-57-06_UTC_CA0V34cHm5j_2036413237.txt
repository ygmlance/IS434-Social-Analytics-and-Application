Happy birthday @gweestero ! This annual event is a rather special one since it happened during #circuitbreaker . 
Thought it would just be like any other day since we can't go out and celebrate but we were wrong! We are really grateful & fortunate to have so many of our friends and family that shared their love with us, filling our hearts (and tummies) in every way possible! Making this #stayhome birthday a truly busy one as we were receiving deliveries non-stop throughout the day. A big thank you to everyone that pampered this big boy these few days, making this birthday an unforgettable one!
