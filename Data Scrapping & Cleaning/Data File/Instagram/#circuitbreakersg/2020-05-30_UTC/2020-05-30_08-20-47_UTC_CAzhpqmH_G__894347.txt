Day 54 : Throwback 2011. Used to do some test shoot years back. I am really thankful that I met a very nice and experienced photographer that introduced me to others photographers ðŸ“¸. It was very fun! ðŸ˜ƒBecause for fashion test shoot we explored different concept and it can be very â€˜dramaâ€™ look too. We went to abandon building, lalang field in Punggol, empty car park and even some ðŸ‘»haunted place in town. I also did makeup at peoples park and bus interchange and got so much attention from the old uncles. ðŸ˜‚
