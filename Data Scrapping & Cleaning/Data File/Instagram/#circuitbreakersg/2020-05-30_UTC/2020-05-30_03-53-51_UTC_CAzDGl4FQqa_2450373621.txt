The best Covid-19 deal I have had to-date! This massive Seafood Platter from the Mandarin Oriental is only $78 and features 8 halves of lobster, 16 prawns, 4 snow crab legs and 4 king crab segments. I'm pretty sure platters like this would have cost over $150 when we dined out! 
It's good for 3-4 pax I think, though it's just hubby and I so we have 8 prawns and 4 halves of lobster leftover for tonight's atas aglio olio pasta dinner. üòú

Of course, we emptied out a bottle of Veuve Clicquot Ros√© too. üòâ

I ordered the chocolate cake, scroll till end, so that I could meet the min spend of $80 for free delivery. Order via https://singapore.mandarinorientalshop.com/products/seafood-platter

So, how about a Sunday boozy seafood brunch for tomorrow?! And thanks @samoosg for showing this off in the 1st place ‚ù§
