A big fat ðŸ’š to you guys for making our first Saturday of operations fully booked & without a hitch. This is our salted caramel Valrhona tart ðŸ¤¤. 4 elements make this awesome piece. A buttery chocolatey tart base, salted caramel, Valrhona 55 and dulcey ganache, topped with our mirror glaze, and cocoa nibs!! (If you were counting we have 4 different chocolate components as well in this tart) which can feed up to 2 on a diet and 1 on a cheat day ðŸ¤£. Whichever you choose, we wonâ€™t judge. Check out our IG stories in a bit to see how we assemble this beauty! ($8)
