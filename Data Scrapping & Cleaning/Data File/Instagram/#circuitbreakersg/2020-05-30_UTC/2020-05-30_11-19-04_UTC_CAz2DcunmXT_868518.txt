The man is hooked on the seafood paella!
Another week has passed but I'm "reliving" my paella-cooking routine for last Saturday morning.ðŸ˜… Using succulent local sea prawns today and yes, I remember to slice the squid into rings (absentmindedly cut it into strips last weekðŸ¤­). Looking at this and the gratified look on his face, the three hours in the kitchen is definitely worthwhile!
