Honey Soy Wings
.
Reminded by @singaporeliciouz it’s been a while since I last bake them. They’re really easy to make, just three ingredients – honey (I prefer floral ones), soy sauce (I’m using  @naturesglorysg organic soy sauce) and sake or Chinese rice wine (花雕酒).
.
Marinade the wings for 2 hrs or longer if you like. Pop them into a 220 degree toaster or oven for 8-10mins each side and we’re done. A quick and no fuss recipe yet big on flavors. For this batch, I added grated fresh ginger for some zing. Recipe adapted from @justonecookbook.
