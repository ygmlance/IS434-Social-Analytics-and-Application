Funny how Lila’s intentions for the weekend sound exactly like mine! 🙌On the To Do list: Read books, watch TV, Zoom, do nothing & “eat and eat and eat so much”. 🤣Especially relate to her Top Priorities list of sleeping all day and “do not get bored”. Last official weekend of #circuitbreakerSG and school hols guys. Let’s be chillin! 🌈🥂🥱😴 (P/S Tickled that she’s got “Not get tricked by Izzy” on her To Do list 😹 The woes of being the meimei) #shesgotherprioritiesright #goodintentions #sgkids #kidsunderlockdown
