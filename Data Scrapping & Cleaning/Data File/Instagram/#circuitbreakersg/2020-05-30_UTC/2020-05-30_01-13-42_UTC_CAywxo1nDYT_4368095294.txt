🏵️CB Day54 - Breakfast🏵️
.
🎉Yeah! It's weekend!🎉
.
How do u eat your prata???
.
Hahaha!!! I enjoy cutting it into small pieces and drenched in curry sauce! .
The alternative way I eat it - cut into small pieces and have a small bowl of curry for me to dunk the pieces into it and let the prata have a good curry spa before I use the chopsticks to "kiap" it out & place into my mouth!🤣🤣🤣
