Hey yogis! While it may seem as though CB is "over", let us not get too excited and start rushing out of our house - in fact, dine-ins, gyms and social gatherings are still NOT allowed!

For those who have been so vigilantly staying at or working from home, here are some other important role you can continue to play while staying at home😇

These efforts may seem small, but (as cliche as it may seem) together we achieve more 🙌

Staying at home helps keep the number of community cases low and hopefully, we can enter Phase 2 earlier than expected and back into the studio! 🙏

So remember, continue to stay fit and stay AT HOME! #homeisthebestplacetobe
