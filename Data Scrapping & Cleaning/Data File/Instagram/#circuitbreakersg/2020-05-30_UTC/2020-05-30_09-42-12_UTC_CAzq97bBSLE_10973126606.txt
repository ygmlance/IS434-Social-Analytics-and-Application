One of those days when I am inspired to make my own Japanese Fresh Fruit Sandwich (also known as Fruit Sando) ... only to realise 😨 I have no strawberry nor whipping cream!

As usual, I improvised with whatever I could find in the kitchen. Whipping cream was replaced with Whipped Cream. Definitely save me time to do the whipping AND 😂 cleaning up!

1️⃣ Fruits: Kiwi, Grapes, Mango 
2️⃣ Breads: Gardenia Low GI Nutri Multi-Grain and Junior White Thick Slice Bread
3️⃣ Whipped Cream: Emborg Whipped Cream

Some of my personal learnings;
➖ Consider the size, orientation and colour of the fruits with respect to how it might look like at the cross section cut.
➖ Many YouTube videos demonstrated the sandwich wrapping to secure the sandwich. To reduce the use of single use item like cling film, I have chosen 🚫 wrap approach.
➖ The common approach is to refrigerate before the cut. As my sandwich has no wrapping, my cheat approach 🤫 is to put the sandwich into the freezer before the cut.

PSSST ... I have ordered 🍓🍓🍓

🤷🏻‍♀️Yes, someone did nag that I should cut the bread crust. Oh well ... maybe next time if I remember 😜
