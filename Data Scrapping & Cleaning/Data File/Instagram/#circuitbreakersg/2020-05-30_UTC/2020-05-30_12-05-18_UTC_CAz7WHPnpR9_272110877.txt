Day 52. The morning sky continues to awe us. Today we tried making some boba pearls and taro soy millk brown sugar bubble tea. It was quite an experience in making the BBT we have been missing. We took the day at a very slow pace. Takeouts from fast food  restaurants are comforting. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homemadedesserts #bubbletea #instadaily
