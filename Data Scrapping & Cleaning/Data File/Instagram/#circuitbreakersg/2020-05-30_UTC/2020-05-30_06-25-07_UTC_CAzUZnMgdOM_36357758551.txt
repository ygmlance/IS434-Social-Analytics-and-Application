Flashback: สวัสดีครับ I surprised myself that I can actually cook Tom Yum Fried Rice #ข้าวผัดต้มยำ. Friends would know that I'm not the type of guy who cooks, but this COVID19 Circuit Breaker in Singapore has brought out the little home cook in us. As human beings, we are highly adaptable creatures, so now I understand how much fun it can be to cook. I actually miss travelling to Thailand, so I really wanted to try to make this fave dish of mine. I had used kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, galangal, bird's eye chilli, Tom Yum paste, eggs, fish sauce, light soya sauce, lime juice, sugar, vegetable oil, squids, prawns, crab stick meat, onions, tomatoes, cashew nuts, spring onion, and Basmati rice. #sph #sphradio #singaporepressholdings  #onefm913  #tomyumfriedrice  #khaophadtomyum  #thaifood  #stayhome  #circuitbreakersg
