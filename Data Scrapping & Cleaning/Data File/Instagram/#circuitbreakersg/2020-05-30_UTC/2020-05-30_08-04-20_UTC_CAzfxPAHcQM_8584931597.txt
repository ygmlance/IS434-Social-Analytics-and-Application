*It‚Äôs not one or the other*

With decreased economic activity bringing about the lowering of carbon emissions during our lockdowns, across the globe there have been  clearer skies, less smog, more wildlife ‚Äì in general a better environment.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
But businesses need to resume operations and people need to go back to work. There is no argument that economic activity must restart, but not at the cost of public health ‚Äì if people are ill the workforce shrinks and the health system bears a heavier burden. It‚Äôs never one or the other.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Being able to restart the economy safely requires government, industry, and people to work together. The hashtag #sgunited says it well. In Singapore, we‚Äôve seen government policy change, private sector innovation and greater corporate social responsibility, and stepped up individual responsibility for personal hygiene. Change is more effective when everyone does their part.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
We might not all be government policy makers or head up multi-billion dollar industries, but as @emmawatson says, ‚ÄúAs consumers we have so much power to change the world by just being careful in what we buy.‚Äù So we can decide to support F&B that champion BYO, refuse excess packaging, and choose reusable options wherever possible. As more of us do this, industry will respond with providing us with more of these options. Take cloth masks for example ‚Äì you guys wanted them and I responded by making them.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
So when you guys start buying coffee on your way to work or a snack on your break, remember to bring your own reusable container. It doesn‚Äôt have to be fancy. üíõüòçü§ó
