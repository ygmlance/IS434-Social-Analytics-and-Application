Itâ€™s always feels good to start the day by organising your thoughts which are waiting for you somewhere, that pile of autumn leaves waiting to be raked, to clear the space.

for Writers to hold the page and start scribbling those words itself is a therapy beyond that if a poem happens a new hope is pinned in their heart, for Writers their words become their solace.
