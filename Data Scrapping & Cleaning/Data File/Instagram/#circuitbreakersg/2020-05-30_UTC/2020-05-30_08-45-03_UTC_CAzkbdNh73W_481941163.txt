Circuit Breaker Day #54:
Intended to get slower on the pace this time to push myself back to 10km trail distance plus it's level of humidity is a puff!! It's been more than a month i have not been running 10km or beyond. Alhamdulilah, did it. Met a couple of local trail runners and nice to meet you bro @fizfotos .
