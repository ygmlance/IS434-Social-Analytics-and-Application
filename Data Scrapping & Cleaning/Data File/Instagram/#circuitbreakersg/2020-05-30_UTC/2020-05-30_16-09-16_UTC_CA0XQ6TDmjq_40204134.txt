1st time doing French🌹 macarons! Been doing for hours. Still, the macarons didn’t raise as high as I thought it would be. Guess I used too much rose flavor liquid cos I wanted to have stronger rose fragrance. Batter too wet to have “feet” and a little over mixing which caused the shells to spread and get a little flat. Kept having some problems with the egg white, difficulty in beating them until they are really stiff. Thankfully it didn’t cracked! Somehow the meringue didn’t form a big clump in the whisk too. Nonetheless still very Happy to have made this lovely French rose macarons in Pastel pink and purple; taste good too! ☺️.
