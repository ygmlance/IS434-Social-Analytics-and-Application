[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Today's afternoon tea session was definitely one of the most memorable one we had in a very long time. Staying at home has somewhat made me lose track of time, but my food memories have helped to bookmark the more special days of my Circuit Breaker experience.
.
My favourite were the Rainbow Kueh Lapis and (tapioca-based) Kueh Bingka with beautiful golden-brown crust, while his was the Apom Bokwa dipped in lots of Durian Pengat.
.
@The_Peranakan's Heritage & Traditional Nyonya Kueh Kueh Gift Set comes with 8 assorted kuehs, Apom Bokwa, Durian Pengat and 2 Malacca Bubble Teas. The packaging is so pretty, it definitely makes for a lovely gift. Great for sharing with the family too. Which dessert item would you pick first? üòã
