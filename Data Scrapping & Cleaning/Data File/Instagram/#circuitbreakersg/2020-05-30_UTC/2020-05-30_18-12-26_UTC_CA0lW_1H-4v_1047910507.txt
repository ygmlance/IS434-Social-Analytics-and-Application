ðŸŒˆ Rainbow Keyboard ðŸŽ¹
â€¢
Lyra had been asking to learn music recently. To start up, I use the rainbow solfege to make it more fun & easier for her. Im very glad to received this rainbow keyboard from @artists_music_studio. It is light and foldable, easy to keep & perfect for travelling as well.

After using it for awhile, Im amazed by how fast Lyra recognise the keyboard concept and able to locate the notes on the keyboard. She is also attracted to the colours and kept on playing it continuously.

Thank you @artists_music_studio for such a great learning tools!
