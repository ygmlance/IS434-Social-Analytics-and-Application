Shanghainese drunken chicken and stir fried xiao bai cai with oyster mushrooms for day 54's dinner... Drunken chicken is cooked chicken soaked in Shaoxing wine and is often served as an appetizer that is eaten cold... The preparation of the drunken chicken was a lengthy, new and fascinating learning experience for me... I added goji berries and red dates to the Shaoxing wine brine for a little additional sweetness... Was so enthusiastic with the drunken chicken that I made too much and decided to send some over to friends... üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
