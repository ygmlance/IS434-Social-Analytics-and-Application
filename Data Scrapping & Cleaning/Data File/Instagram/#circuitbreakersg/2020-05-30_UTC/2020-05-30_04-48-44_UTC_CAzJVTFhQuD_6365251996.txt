Resting, tendering, being. Last night's women nidra night was a session of practising restfulness, gratitude in preparation of stepping out into the new beginning/new normal/post-CB (whatever terms that resonate better with you), courageous sharing, flowing with miss-takes, and being non-perfect. See you next month for a night of restful gathering! 🍃 26 June, Fri, 8.15 - 9.30 pm (Sg time/GMT +8)
💗 Online via Zoom
