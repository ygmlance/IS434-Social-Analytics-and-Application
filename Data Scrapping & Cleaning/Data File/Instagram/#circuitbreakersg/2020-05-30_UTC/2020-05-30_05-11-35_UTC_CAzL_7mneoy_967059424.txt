Cages still not open. On my state-sanctioned outdoor walk alone today, it would seem that the world has decided that the CB rules no longer apply to them if they donâ€™t feel like it. Sooooo shocking that our new infection rate was up again yesterday. How are people still not grasping that the longer they act like dumbdumbs, the longer these frustrating rules are going to apply?? #quarantinerage #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #architecturephotography #interiorsphotography #realestatephotography #hamiltononscotts #condo #latergram #igsg #sghomes
