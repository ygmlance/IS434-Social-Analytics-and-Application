I always say I'll try to hit 5km in at least 1 jog 🏃‍♀️ but never do 😅
For #runformajulahmovement, I will still try... Worth a shot anyway! 🤷‍♀️ As a group effort by @ufitsingapore, they're organising a 24-hr run to help raise awareness for the worthy cause, who delivers set meals & treat packs to Frontline workers & the migrant community. Each person will run for 30 mins and the aim is to collectively run 1,000km over 24 hours!

Hope we're getting there soon! #ufit24hrrun #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
