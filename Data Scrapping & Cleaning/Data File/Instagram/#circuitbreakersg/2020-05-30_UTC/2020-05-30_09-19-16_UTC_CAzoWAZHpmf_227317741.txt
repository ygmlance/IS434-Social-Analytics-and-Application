23 months late is better than never right? Finally hung up the beautiful work of art that I requested @curiouslah to paint when Ellie was born (I'll move it to her room when we move to our own place!). This verse from the Bible cannot come at a more appropriate time. We are all wonderfully made in God's image. We may look different, but we are all loved by Him. Love, respect and be kind to one another ðŸ’ž
