Saturday Brunch, was Braised Pork Trotter Bee Hoon! This old-school classic, uses tinned Braised Pork Trotter from China, which invariably contains gelatinous chunks of pork trotter, a chunk of pork belly, shiitake mushrooms and chestnuts, in a rich, fatty braising sauce. In preparation for cooking, i drained the sauce out and kept it aside, and carefully deboned the trotters and cut the mushrooms and chestnuts into smaller pieces using a pair of kitchen scissors. I sweat some minced garlic and lard cubes in lard, and threw in half a packet of Bee Hoon, or Rice Vermicelli, that had been cold soaked and cut beforehand. I threw in a splash of water to moisten, and added a swirl of Superior Light Soya Sauce to season. After everything is well mixed, the trotter and other solid ingredients were added and mixed well. The sauce from the tin was added, as were bean sprouts, thin sliced round cabbage, sprigs of Chye Sim, or Mustard Greens and red chilli cut into thin strips. I added another splash of water to help ease the mixing, and fried the noodles over high heat, till the vegetables were cooked and everything was well mixed. I served it with a topping of fried shallots. Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #porktrotterbeehoon #oldschoolfood #sgfood #traditionalfood #traditionalhomecookedfood #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #saturdaybrunch #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
