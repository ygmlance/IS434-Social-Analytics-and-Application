Woke up craving for something creamy and comforting. Took a look at my fridge and decided on pasta for lunch. Presenting my 亂亂煮 (anyhow cook) 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐲 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐡𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐩 𝐅𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢 𝐀𝐥𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐨. Added a splash of white wine and bacon oil to the sauce on a whim - best decision ever! The sauce’s so creamy, yummy and versatile, I think it will work well with meat dishes! 🤤🍗🥩🍖 ⁣
