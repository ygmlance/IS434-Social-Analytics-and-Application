Cook mee soto again~ this time with more ingredients (shredded chicken, fish cake, bean sprouts, egg, fried shallots) For mum love chilli like me, can add your own favourite chilli paste and the kid still can enjoy non spicy version. Finally garnish with local celery which i do not get, supermarket run out of stock. ðŸ˜¢
