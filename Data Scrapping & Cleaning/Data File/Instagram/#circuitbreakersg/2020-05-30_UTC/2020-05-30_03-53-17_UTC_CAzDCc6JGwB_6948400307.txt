On the last weekend before #circuitbreakersg measures are lifted, we finally get down to home improvement. The kids have been talking about painting their room a different colour for the longest time. We eventually settled on locally innovated @gowithgush Cair Fresh range, because it’s non-toxic, zero VOCs and we get to #supportlocal

It’s almost crazy embarking on a project like this before school reopens but the most vivid memories of my childhood were the times we spent alongside my parents, painting the walls or hand polishing our floors. Hopefully my kids will have similar memories to accompany them in the years ahead.
