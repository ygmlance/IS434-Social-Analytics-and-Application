For the love of stir fry...my favourite #circuitbreakersg dish! Prep and cooking time less than 30 mins (which is one of the reasons why it’s my fav dish 😆)⁣
⁣Throw some beef, carrots, bell pepper, spring onion & stir fry it with GF rice noodles, sesame oil and GF soya sauce. The secret is to marinate the beef in garlic, ginger, sesame oil, black pepper, GF soya sauce and rice vinegar mix (set aside for 10-15 mins) 🤫 Eat it with 🌶 if you like it spicy 🔥 enjoy! ⁣
