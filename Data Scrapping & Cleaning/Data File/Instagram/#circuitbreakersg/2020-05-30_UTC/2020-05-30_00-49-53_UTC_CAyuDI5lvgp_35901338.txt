My love @amileekang and @maelethsarah baked these Paw Patrol chocolate chip cookies together the other day using a cookie pre-mix! It was their first attempt at baking cookies and it turned out really yummy. 
Love how our new EuropAce microwave oven opened up so many cooking and baking options for Amilee—check it out on Shopee in the link in our bio. 👍

I’m just going to be the food taster and enjoy all the delicious dishes! Been having home-cooked pizzas for snack quite often—so blessed. Thank God I still do some exercise daily to stay in shape 💪

Are you cooking or baking a lot more too during this #CircuitBreakerSG? Stay healthy and safe! 😀
