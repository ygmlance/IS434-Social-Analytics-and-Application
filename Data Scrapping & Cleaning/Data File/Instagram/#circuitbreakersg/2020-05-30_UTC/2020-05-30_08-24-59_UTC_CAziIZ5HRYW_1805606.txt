30 May 2020: || Muddy Farm || 🐓🐖🐄
So I thought of surprising Joseph this morning with this muddy farm experience after how he loved the instant snow play last week.
•
The story went that it was ‘raining’ one day in the farm and the animals got all covered in ‘mud’. It was an instant invitation to play and be prepared for things to get real messy 🙈
•
‘Rain’= A mixture of vinegar + water. ‘Mud’= A mixture of expired cocoa power, coffee, chia seed.. or anything you want get rid of in the kitchen. Oh and add baking powder for the extra bubbly sizzle.
