So here’s the thing. I was waiting for the cheese to melt to get a good shot. But one kid cut a big hole in the others hair. So this is the best shot I’ve got. Philly cheese steak sandwich using #softmilkbunsclub buns shaped into hoagie rolls.

I need to now go and figure out how to salvage the hair. It would have been better if they did this at the beginning of #circuitbreakersg.
