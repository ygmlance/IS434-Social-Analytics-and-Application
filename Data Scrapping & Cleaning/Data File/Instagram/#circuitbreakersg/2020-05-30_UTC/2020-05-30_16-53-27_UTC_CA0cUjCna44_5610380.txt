Hair cutting day for the children. Been cutting their hair since birth just because I’m too lazy to bring them out. So there’s really no diff to me when the barbers/ hair salons closed during circuit breaker period. Cut Zhe’s hair because it’s getting way too long for my liking and gave Zizi a trim on the bangs and length just because she likes the texture at the back of her short hair. #haircut #childrenhaircut #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #beforeandafter #homehaircuts #hairsalonathome
