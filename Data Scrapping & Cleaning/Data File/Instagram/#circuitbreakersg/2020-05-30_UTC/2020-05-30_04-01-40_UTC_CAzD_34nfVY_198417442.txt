üíñPurple Sweet Potato Chiffon Cakeüíñ
First attempt making chiffon cake and I hand whisked the meringue batter. My chiffon mould was too small. Had two chiffon mould but oven was too small to fit two. Ended up I had to pour into another rectangular tin. So was a bit wary if it would turn out good. 
Smells damn good - eggy fragrance with sweetness from purple sweet potato. Soft spongy texture. Yay. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Followed the recipe from: https://whattocooktoday.com/purple-sweet-potato-chiffon-cake.html
