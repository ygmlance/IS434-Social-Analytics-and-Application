Heading into the last weekend before #circuitbreakersg starts to phase out, I am beyond grateful, honoured, blessed and deeply touched by all the gifts of food and other things (mostly food) that you, my wonderful friends, have sent me.
You have also offered your virtual shoulders to lessen the agony and confusion of these strange times, given me laughter and uplifting words (thank you, instagram and whatsapp), opened your homes to me online, allowed me to celebrate milestones with you (yay, zoom n houseparty) and have **Just. Been. There.**
I hope I have been deserving of your friendship.  I await the day when I can meet up with you and watch out - there will be HUGS!
