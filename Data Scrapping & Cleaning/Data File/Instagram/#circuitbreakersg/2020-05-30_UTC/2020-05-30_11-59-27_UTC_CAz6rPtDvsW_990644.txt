When you are the only person wanting to eat lunch. You scroll through 15 mins on grab food.... itâ€™s going to take a long time coz itâ€™s peak hour.  You just anyhow lah.  The 15 mins wasted can already cook a simple meal. So lunch was Taiwanese Kiki Soy Sauce QQ noodles. Boiled a few frozen French cauliflower. The frozen cauliflowers actually taste good! Airfried 6 spicy Thai Chicken Drumlets. Food from all around the world. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
