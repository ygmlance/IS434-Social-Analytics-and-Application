[Tai Cheong Bakery]
.
Not much description is required for this popular @taicheongsg Cha Chaan Teng which originated from Hong Kong. Famous for their egg tarts and pastries, but serving great dishes as well!
. 
Egg Tart ($2): One of the best egg tarts in town but is a little steep in its price (but it’s worth every penny, trust me) Their buttery and flakt crust paired perfectly well with their wobbly and sweet egg custard. I love how their crust wasn’t too dry or dense; and had a fantastic texture. And most importantly, their egg tarts are freshly made by batches so their egg custard does not sink unlike some shops.
. 
Pandan Egg Tart ($2): A unique twist to their egg tarts; pandan. The pandan taste was strong but was not overpowering over the egg custard. . 
Char Siew Pie ($2.80): The char siew was generous in its filling and it was very delicious; not too salty nor too mushy. The pie crust was very airy. The pie was pretty filling so sharing is recommended if you want to try their egg tarts 😂
