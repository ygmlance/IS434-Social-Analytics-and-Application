Dinner this evening, was a quick reheat of Wednesday morningâ€™s Cabbage Rice, and Satay Beef with Kai Lan, a Teochew dish that is particular to Hong Kong. This was something thrown together from Thursdayâ€™s leftover satay sauce, which was added and cooked together with some sliced beef that had been marinated with fish sauce, superior light soya sauce and Shaoxing wine and stir-fried until half cooked. This was then topped over some flash fried Kai Lan, or Chinese Kale. Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #cabbagerice #sataybeefwithgailan #hkfood #teochewfood #hongkongteochew #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #nowastemeal #reheatedleftovers #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
