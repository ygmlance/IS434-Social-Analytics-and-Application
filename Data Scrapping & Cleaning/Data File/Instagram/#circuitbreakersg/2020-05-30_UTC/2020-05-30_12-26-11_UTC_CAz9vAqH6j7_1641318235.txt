@MuzArtSingapore Online Lesson 4 - DIY Vision Board⁣
⁣
This week, the teachers revisited with the kiddos how they practiced gratitude and empathy towards the people and things around them. Recalling their previous classes - Lesson 1: Mummy, Lesson 2: Mother Earth, Lesson 3: Environment, and this week's theme for Lesson 4: Yourself.⁣
⁣
With school reopening soon after 2 months of circuit breaker (yes it's an unprecedented weird time!), the teachers guided them to think more about themselves. Coming back and reorganising their personal thoughts, visualising short and long terms goals to stay motivated. Presumably, to better understand what they want in their lives. Swipe for a better snap of each of their final Vision Board. Can you tell what their aspirations are?⁣
