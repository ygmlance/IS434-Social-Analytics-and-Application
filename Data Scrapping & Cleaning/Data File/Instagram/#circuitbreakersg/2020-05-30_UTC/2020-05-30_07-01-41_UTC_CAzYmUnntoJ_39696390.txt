Been online shopping during this #CircuitBreakerSG period (Who am I kidding? Was it just during this period!? ðŸ˜‚)... Anyways, I finally decided to take the plunge and try out @IDSSkincare after to the tele-consultation with Dr Tan. Keeping my fingers crossed for even better skin in the weeks to come! I'd gotten the Parent's Faith set from @JYXShop but the second picture shows the list of products that were prescribed for my skin. Super thankful for Dr Tan's promo code and a tad depressed that my orders didn't come with their awesome hand sanitiser (which I thought would be included as a GWP and hence, didnt add it to my order ðŸ˜­)
