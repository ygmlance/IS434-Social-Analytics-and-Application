Day 26 Hols = Day 54 of #circuitbreakersg 
5km run
#7daythighchallenge with #blogilates

I made my run today and forced myself to get up, I need to sleep early but didn't do so again. I need to be more productive with my time. 
Today's run was good. Even though my left knee had slight pain, told myself just keep going. I'm not changing my running route so just keep moving.. Today's thigh challenge was tough. For 2 days, I couldn't keep my leg up for the 2nd workout but today, I managed too! (in lots of pain though!) let's hope I can still do it tmrw! 
And thanks for voting. I went to cut my fringe yesterday. Ha.. Now it's ugly cos of exercise, hope it can look a bit better? Haha.. Happy weekend and 2 days left to school starting.. Are u ready? Cos I'm not! Haha... #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
