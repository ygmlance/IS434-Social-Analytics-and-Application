Seen everyone will at least be staying home to work for a little while more, let look at five tips for your working desk.

1. Having your back facing the wall will be ideal, the wall will act as a support (靠山) to you.

2. Keep your desk nice and tidy because messy desk creates negative energy.

3. Ideally use a rectangle desk instead of an L shape desk.

4. Do not have your back facing the door as that will be not ideal.

5. Have enough lighting for your desk; you do not want to work in the dark.
