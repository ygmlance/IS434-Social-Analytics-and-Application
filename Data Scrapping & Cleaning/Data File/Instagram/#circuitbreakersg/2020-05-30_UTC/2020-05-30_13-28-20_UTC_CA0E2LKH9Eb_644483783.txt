Activating teacup nursery again after (1) Iâ€™ve harvested and consumed my planted shallots - twice, (2) couldnâ€™t find a smidgen of spring onions in the shops this week.

In my Tuesday supermarket hunt, shallots were sold in a huge bag - like maybe 30 in one (too much for me!). By Friday, smaller portions were available - 8 in a bag, where I rejoice at seeing live roots already sprouting. (People must be wondering why this crazy lady was so ecstatic over shallots ðŸŒ±âœ¨ðŸ˜…)
.
To prove Iâ€™m also a crazy stones lady - doesnâ€™t this shallot look like a #Rhodochrosite? ðŸ¤£âœ¨ðŸ’Ž.
