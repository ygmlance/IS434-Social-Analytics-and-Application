We had fabulous #pubfare from @ladanddadsg tonight! Their famous #fishandchips and beef stew were incredibly tasty. In addition, I was super impressed by their #scotchegg, which was as flavorful as ramen egg, with a crust of minced sausage meat around it (perfect for #egglovers and #meatlovers). Their chicken nuggets also were simple but oh so addictive. Overall a very hearty meal that is much higher quality than standard pub food!

You can order via @deliveroo_sg and @foodpandasg, though they appear to have a wider menu selection on #oddle.
