【Recipe】Simple Korean meal for dinner tonight. #honeybeecookssimpledinner Nowadays one pot meals works the best! Whatever that can get us through the day easier!  Even though it was easier to whip this up, it was still delicious and packed full of flavours. Everyone enjoyed it. 
Hectic day running around to complete errands and busy baking in the kitchen. Glad everything all turn out well. 
Didn’t really know what to cook for dinner till I scrambled through the fridge. Spicy Pork Belly with kimchi served with garlic rice topped with cheese. 
Tangy, spicy, and tender pork, perfect bite with the fluffy cheesy rice. So easy to make too! Toss everything together and it’s like a pork & kimchi fried rice. I think if you serve dry tossed Korean instant noodles in the middle, it’ll work just as well too! Yummy! 
Also cooked Wagyu gyoza and burger patty from @yakiniku_plaza . The quality of the meats speaks for itself👍🏻 #honeybeeweekendmeals

Catch me cooking this dish in my IGS.
