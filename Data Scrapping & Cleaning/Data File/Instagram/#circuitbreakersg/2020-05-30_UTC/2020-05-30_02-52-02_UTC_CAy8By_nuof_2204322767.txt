Our big meal delivered from @fatprincesg and @neonpigeonsg 
It is so cool that we can get food from various restaurants in the same meal, mixing even cuisines. 
I finally tried the Fat Prince salads, kebabs, and with Neon Pigeon's twisted Japanese.

I loved the sweets best ðŸ¥° it's yuzu white chocolate fudge by Neon Pigeon, looks simple but perfectly fixed my sweet tooth. 
And the kebab was a classic! (the breakdown of spring pea falafel: how we share 2 kebabs among 3 peopleðŸ¤£) #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakerfooddelivery #sgfoodies #savefnbsg
