Homemade Ngoh hiang & Crispy breadcrumbs meatballs

Sambal chili clams (lala) from @9sseafood 
Stir-fry french bean with fish cake

Previously shared recipe for Ngoh Hiang. This time made Crispy breadcrumbs meatballs using the ngoh hiang paste. Replace the beancurd skin with breadcrumbs. Simply use any white bread, cut it into small cubes, coat the readily rolled meatball with breadcrumbs. You can press the breadcrumbs on the meatball lightly to secure the crumbs. Deep fry with medium heat ðŸ¤—
