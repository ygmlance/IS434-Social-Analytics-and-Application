YAY NO MORE FEAR OF BANANA SKIN

Yes my son on the start of the year suddenly had this irrational fear of banana skin when a house fly landed on a banana skin. 
Whenever we go for groceries shopping 
He will be so terrified  whenever he saw bananas  he will scream horror, like he was truly deathly afraid of the banana skin.  But the funny thing he still love to eat banana just that I have the peel of the skin of for him 
He wasn't like this before. 
So during this circuit breaker I have came up if a game that telling he doesn't have to be afraid.  He got upper the courage to seat beside me n looking a me peeling the banana skin halfway.  I told him to peel all the way at first he was afraid but slowly he got better after few days of trying.  Today finally he is able to get the banana on the table hand it to me  n he is able to peel the banana skin of on his own 
Truly I feel blessed  that he is no longer afraid n I managed to help him overcome his weird fear of banana  skin through game
