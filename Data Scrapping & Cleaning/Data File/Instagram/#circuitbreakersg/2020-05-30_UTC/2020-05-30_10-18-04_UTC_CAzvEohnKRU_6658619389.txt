We like to cook equally good but simplified version of a dish. Instead of sweet and sour pork, we usually cook sweet and sour popcorn chicken, but this is fried fish! â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
So really simple, just use the fried fish or popcorn chicken mixed with ketchup together with onion and pineapple, and we promise you that everything taste good! ðŸ¥°
