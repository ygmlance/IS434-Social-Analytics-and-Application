~ Circuit Breaker Period ~
I honestly don’t think we would get another season like this in our lives. What an unprecedented season to be in, where the world went into a sleep mode, shuttered shutters all around us, staying at home has become our way of life the past two months. We build layers upon layers of sustaining ourselves in different ways within a confined space, we attempted various activities we would otherwise never have the time for, and most of all, being with the kids 24/7 has been the greatest gift of this period. With our normal routines reaching a halt, in a life where there was no “physical school”, “extra classes” or outdoor play” we see so much of each other we literally breathe each other in. Amidst the challenges that came with it, as Keira had succinctly put it “it doesn’t matter so long we are one family unit”, and I thought, how much truth there was to it. 
For at the end of the day, so long we have one another, we will do fine 🌈 
Goodbye circuit breaker, thank you for gifting us the gift of time. .
