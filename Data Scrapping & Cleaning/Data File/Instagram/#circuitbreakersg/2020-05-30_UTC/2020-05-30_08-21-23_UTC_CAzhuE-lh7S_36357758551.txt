Flashback to 12th April: At the supermarket this morning. Since staying home, I'm actually more healthy because I've been snacking on cherry tomatoes and seedless grapes. Each time I feel hungry, I'll just pop 3-4 cherry tomatoes or seedless grapes into my mouth and somehow they relieve my hunger. 
This morning, I bought shitake mushrooms, some dry mushroom cheese mixture and grated cheddar cheese. Going to try to use my air fryer. Will also cook Basmati rice in a rice cooker. Stay safe and stay healthy folks. Don't forget to wear a mask when you go out. P.S. Tune in to ONE FM 91.3 (Singapore radio station) now if you need some company. I'm on air until 6pm today.
