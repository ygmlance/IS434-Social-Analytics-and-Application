And since it’s the weekend and my first test is over (less stressed although there’re 2 coming up next week😩), I have decided to challenge myself in cooking something more “fine dining”. 😅🤣

Following my kids’ favorite chef @gordongram’s recipe - Grilled 🦞 with Bloody Mary Linguine (@youtube vid: https://youtu.be/zhK4HF_oRho). Ok I cheated with Conchiglie as my #glutenfree kids prefer this and added prawns to it.

Thank god I didn’t burn my house down! Oh and thanks for the lovely 🦞 and super fresh 🍤 , @mr.fishmongersg
