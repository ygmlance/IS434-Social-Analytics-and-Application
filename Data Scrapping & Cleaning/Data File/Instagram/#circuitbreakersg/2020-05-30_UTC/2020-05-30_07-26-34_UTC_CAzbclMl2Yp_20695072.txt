Recently have been so interested with nature especially flora’s and fauna’s. And with all the meetings recently, I have slowed down producing works. Have been really losing the mood to paint because we are all drained out and depleted. But not making anymore excuses. The world itself is enough to burn your brain cells. So much violence and it can really be a little bit overwhelming to carry on with our own lives knowing people are suffering and dying. But, you gotta do what you gotta do. You have to play a part by being a little kinder and doing your things without harming anyone. One act of kindness can cause a ripple effect, doesn’t matter how small it is. Let’s take heart and be kind. x
