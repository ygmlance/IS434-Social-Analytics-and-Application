; {Circuit Breaker Day 54}

In loving memory of my grandma, who passed away on 31 May 2018, I baked her favourite Butter Cake.

2 years on, I still wish she was here. Yet with the whole COVID19 situation, I’m also relieved she isn’t here to experience this world we are in now. It’s been bittersweet.

I miss you. Hope you are having a joyous time up there with grandpa and my 6 hamsters.
