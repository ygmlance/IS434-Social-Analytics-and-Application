3 MORE DAYS TO "Safe Re-Opening".
. 
Wow! It's almost here.... Tomorrow, Monday and Phase 1 begins!

Quite remarkable that we have come so far. Today, we have just conducted a Virtual Open House for our River Isles 4 Bedroom + Study where the owners are still residing in. 🙏 We're very grateful to the owners in assisting to show the house as well as buyers and cobroke agents who showed keen interest to participate in this Virtual Open House. Although I do understand that virtual viewing may not be able to fully replace physical viewing for property transactions but I feel change is accelerating in the marketplace.

Back in 2018, CEA was pushing for the Real Estate Industry Transformation Map to be a seamless online digital transaction. Steps were slowly being introduced - This current pandemic and the CB took it to a whole new level! 
Now, more than just paperwork goes digital but also viewings and discussions can be performed remotely from home! I'm quite sure even after everything "returns to normal", it will be a new normal.

ps. We'll be conducting our 🏡 Landed Open House Viewing next weekend. Keep an eye out. 😉
