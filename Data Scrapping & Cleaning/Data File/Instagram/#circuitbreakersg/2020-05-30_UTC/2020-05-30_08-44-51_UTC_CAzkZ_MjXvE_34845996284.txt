Fried Bee Hoon

This is a simple and quick fried bee hoon. It is a quick fix by using canned stewed pork slice, don’t need a lot of seasoning and oil here to get flavorful and smooth bee hoon because of canned pork. May not be healthy but I take it when I don’t have much time to plan/cook a meal.

Ingredients: Canned stewed pork slice, 1 pack of beehoon, cabbage and eggs

❶ soak bee hoon in water before you start 
❷ heat up oil and scrambled egg
❸ into the same pot, fry sliced garlic until slightly brownish and the whole can of stewed pork slice. Bring it to boiling
❹ add cabbage. Cover to cook for 2 minutes until the cabbages are slightly soft
❺ add 2 tablespoon of dark soya sauce, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of soya sauce. Add water to cover the level of cabbage, mix well and bring it to boiling
❻ add bee hoon in and stir to mix well. Cover and  cook with middle fire. Stir intermittently to make sure all bee hoon absorb the seasoning. This will continue for about 10-15 minutes until bee hoon is soft 
❼ add more soya sauce to taste and then ready to serve
