Incorporating number bonds into the math-addition tool box.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I can tap on the exact set up for my baby girl in a few months’ times (without the math portion) to introduce and hone few skills:⁣⁣
- hand eye coordination ⁣⁣
- gross motor skills⁣⁣
- grasps ⁣⁣
- object permanence (the marble will resurface after being dropped, instead of disappearing into the cone)⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Leveraging on the math set up (shared a few posts earlier), we recap her learnings on number bonds as per her school homework. This was what went on in our homeschool session during the first leg of #circuitbreakersg . If you recall, we created a classroom with her soft toys, and labelled their ‘names’ using masking tapes!🤣⁣⁣

I’m Glad that the June hols got brought forward, it’s pretty tiring to be English, maths, Chinese and motor skills teacher 🤣 but I guess my girl had fun with the ‘classroom’ activities cuz she looked forward to the sessions almost Everyday! I looked forward to my coffee breaks instead (Lol!), but I can’t deny it was quite fun on some days.
