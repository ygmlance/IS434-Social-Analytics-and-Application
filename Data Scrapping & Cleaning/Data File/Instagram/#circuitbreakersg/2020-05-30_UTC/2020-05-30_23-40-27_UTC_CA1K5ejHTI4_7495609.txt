{Egg-Periments} 🧪 - Bouncy Eggs 🥚 .
This experiment required patience from the kids as the eggs have to be soaked in vinegar for 3-5 days. I got the kids excited by showing them a video of those bouncy eggs, then asked them what colours do they wana dye their eggs. #charmerteo chooses blue, #louisateo red & #jeromedrondronteo yellow. Mama made an extra egg just in case their are accident. When the colourful vinegar were ready, the kids were excited to put in the eggs & they realised that bubbles started roaming around the eggs when they were soaked in the cups... after one day, they noticed a layer of foam floating on top the eggs.. by 3rd day they can’t wait anymore & wanted to play with them! So we had fun shining light 💡 into the beautiful coloured eggs & bouncing them.

The next egg experiment was easy. I got a jar with small opening & asked them to place the hard boiled egg onto the jar, obviously the egg can’t go inside. Just burn a strip of paper & it would be “magically” sucked into the jar. The kids were all amazed by that!
