Basic Hummus | One of 2019's largest food trend, the hummus. Making it from scratch with dried chickpeas somehow tastes much better than the store-bought stuff.. or maybe it's placebo to convince myself the hours-long cook was worth it lol. Another pro of making hummus at home: it's totally customizable to make it healthier (replaced some of the oil in traditional recipes with broth) or more garlicky/lemony as you like. Great as a party dip or working snack.
