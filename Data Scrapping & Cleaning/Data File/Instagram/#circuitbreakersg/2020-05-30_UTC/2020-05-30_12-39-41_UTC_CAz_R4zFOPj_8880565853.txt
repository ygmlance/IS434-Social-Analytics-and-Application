Made a basque cheesecake today (which tasted great if I may so myself)!!! I can see why they call it the cheesecake that breaks all the rules - 1) that char on the top made me so anxious and 2) I still miss a good digestive biscuit/tart base. Recipe courtesy of @bonappetitmag ðŸ’• No better way to enjoy this than with family, and a timely reminder that time spent at home can be as rewarding when there are people to share it with :-) Think I could do with better oven management, but I'd like to think that it's a work in progress and that better things are in order!!! #basquecheesecake #circuitbreakersg
