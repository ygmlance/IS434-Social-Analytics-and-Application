A good local bakery for traditional cakes if you’re in the area!

Their most famous cake! The pandan tasted a bit artificial, but the gula melaka and coconut filling was delish!

Very fudgy and rich chocolate flavour, with a hint of baileys flavour. I love the crispy bottom layer!

The crumble was too sugary for me, which overpowered the apple filling, which was, albeit delicious, already lacking in amount.

𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐜𝐚𝐤𝐞 ($𝟐.𝟓𝟎) - 𝟖/𝟏𝟎
My favourite one out of all the cakes! Not too sweet, and the strawberry filling didn’t taste artificial, which I loved. The cream wasn’t the best but still a pretty decent cake!

Although the portions are pretty small, but for the price and taste, I think they’re pretty worth!

Overall: 7/10
