Day 54 of #CircuitBreakerSg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jazzed up my meal a couple of days ago with fried chicken from @shihlinsnacks. I stir fried lots of veggies like zucchini and onions and added the fried chicken towards the end. You won’t recognize this as any particular dish, but that’s the beauty because you can basically add the chicken to any dish for a more savory tone.

Try making a meal out of any product from @shihlinsnacks, snap your jazzed up meal, hashtag #ZhngItUpwithShihlin and tag 3 friends. You could win a year’a supply of XXL Crispy Chicken!

Tagging you guys and can’t wait to see your creations! @weiiting @adelenly @siewzy.
