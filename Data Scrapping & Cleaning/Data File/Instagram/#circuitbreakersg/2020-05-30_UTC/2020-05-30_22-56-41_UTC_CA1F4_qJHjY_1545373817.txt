We had steamed corn, siew mai 烧卖 n lotus paste buns for breakfast yesterday.  I discovered this brand SMH 新美興 at NTUC’s chiller section. Their premium siew mai is really good tasting n of good quality. Their lotus paste bun is equally good. The lotus paste is just mildly sweet n their bun is chewy. 
We will be trying their glutinous rice lor mai gai 糯米鸡 for breakfast today.
