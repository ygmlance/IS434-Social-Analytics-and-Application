ALLAH has told us that HIS  pleasure 
may be attained through gratitude. " If you are grateful, HE is pleased with you..." (Az-Zumar 39:7). .
.
The Prophet, peace and blessings 
be upon him, said: "ALLAH is pleased 
with HIS servant if, when he eats 
something, he thanks ALLAH for it, 
and when he drinks something, 
he thanks ALLAH for it" (Muslim).
