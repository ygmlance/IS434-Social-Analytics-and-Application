In the sculpting process I try to bring out how the cloth has been woven - the warp and the weft. I want that to be very clear and visible within the artwork.

The interwovenness ðŸ•¸symbolizes the connections in our world- the connections we urban dwellers have with nature, but also with people all over the world. If you pull on a thread within a fabric, the entire fabric is impacted. (This work is in a private collection)
