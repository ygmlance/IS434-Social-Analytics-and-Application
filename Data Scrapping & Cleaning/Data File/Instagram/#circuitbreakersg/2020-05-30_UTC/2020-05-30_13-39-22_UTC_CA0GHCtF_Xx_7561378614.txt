â˜•ðŸ¥› Totally slipped my mind to post up my attempt at Dalgona Coffee here. It's almost a must-do at home during the Circuit Breaker period. Using Island Coconut infused instant coffee so that my coffee doesn't taste mainstream. And yes, I added too little sugar because pouring it into the mixing bowl makes me scared. On hind sight, I should have been more brave. ðŸ˜• #bitter #dalgonacoffee #myfoodscoopsxfoodnoms
