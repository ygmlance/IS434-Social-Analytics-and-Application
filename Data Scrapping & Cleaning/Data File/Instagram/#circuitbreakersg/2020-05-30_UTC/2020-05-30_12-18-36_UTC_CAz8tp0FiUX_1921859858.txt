In case it’s not obvious enough, I’m 42 today!! 😆⠀

So how do you celebrate your birthday when you are stuck at home with kids? Make them do crafts! So here ya go - my birthday paper art done by the boys. That’s one for the memories. ⠀
⠀
Well, the older ya get... the less presents ya get. But it’s alright, I’m posting it here so you all can go ahead and wish me a happy birthday in the comments ok. 🤣⠀

My birthday wish? No more Covid-19... or maybe good health? Or perhaps, a birthday wish from @johnnydepp 🧐
