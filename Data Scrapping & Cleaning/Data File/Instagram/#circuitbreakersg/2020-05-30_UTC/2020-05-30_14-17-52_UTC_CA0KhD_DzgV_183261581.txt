#circuitbreakersg day 54
2 more days to go🙏💪 Thousand gold had some surprise #circuitbreakerlovedelivery 
Bakes from Keong Siak and Firebakes and homecooked chicken wings and peach-gum/ lotus seeds/longan/fungus tongshui plus the yumilious mee siam from Red Hill market... all personally hand delivered 🥰
She was caught by these two unexpected deliveries. She  already cooked the thai style tanghoon with prawns for our lunch 😂
After the heavy lunch i decided to have salad for dinner (fresh leaves from farm to table courtesy of last night’s ACI Live Aid event) while the rest ordered North Indian Cuisine... something which i dont fancy at all 😂
