Mexican Street-Styled Grilled Corn ($5.50++)
If you’re looking for an upgrade from your normal buttered corn, this is it 🤩 Chipotle mayo and cotija cheese makes for the perfect mix of a creamy yet tangy coating of the fresh sweet corn that is sure to start a party in your mouth 🤪
.
Signature Baja Fish Taco ($16.00++)
Crumbed barramundi fillet, chipotle mango salsa, slaw, lime and mayo. This came beautifully packaged with literally every component packed separately to ensure maximum freshness and no sogginess which is much appreciated☺️ The tortillas were still warm when delivered to me! However, tastewise it was very average and didn’t exactly gel well. There were a bit stingy on the mango salsa and slaw too 🥺
.
De Barbacoa Taco ($14.50++)
Braised lamb, grilled tomato, mint and red onion salsa. I usually avoid lamb as it has that certain smell when cooked but this was not the case! The lamb was actually really fragrant, soft, juicy and extremely flavourful. The mint dip was a great contrasting fresh pairing too 😋
. 
Mixta Salad ($12.00++)
Garden leaves, tomatillo, avocado, pickled jicama, pecans and chipotle agave dressing. They were extremely generous with the avocado, giving a whole half of the avocado! The pecans were also covered and cooked in a kind of sweet sauce that gave it a perculiar taste tbh that I can’t really pin down but it kinda tastes like a sweet guava sauce😌
.
Super Churros ($11.50++)
Crispy churros and Mexican chocolate sauce. The churros were THICCC and definitely bigger than your average churros. It was covered in just the right amount of cinnamon sugar and was soft and chewy on the inside with a harder crispy exterior. The perfect churro 🤤

Mexican chicken wings ($11.00++)
.
Roasted chicken burrito ($11.00++)
.
Totopos ($3.50++) + Salsa Roja ($2.80++) + Guacamole ($5.50++)
.
Mexican cuisine is my absolute favourite so I’m so glad I got all of the above which is part of their Super Feast combo for $155++! It serves 6-8 pax and is definitely something  I would recommend for a party vibe meal 🥳 A few hit and misses I would say but still great overall! Will be back to try their cocktails😛
