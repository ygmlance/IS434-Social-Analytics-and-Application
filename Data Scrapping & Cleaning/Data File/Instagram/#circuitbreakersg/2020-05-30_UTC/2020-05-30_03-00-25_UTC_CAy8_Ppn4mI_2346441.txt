When I opened the @sendthinks box to check out the snacks inside, the kids started echoing “this is mine”, “No, this IS mine” arguing who eats what 😅Bought this coz I love Japan snacks & I’m curious to see what snacks are inside the box! This is the jumbo sized version which I feel is more worth it.⁣
⁣
Not forgetting a little surprise that I have received in the box! We managed to get 10% off next order from my random scratch card!⁣

Btw, SendThinks is doing a giveaway on their IG till 31st May, go check it out & win some snacks✨ ⁣
