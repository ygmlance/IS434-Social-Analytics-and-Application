Soldera Case Basse 100% Sangiovese IGT Toscana 2006

Couldnâ€™t not pair this legendary wine with good food so drove over to Da Luca for some excellent Italian food to takeaway. The aromatics on this was 10/10 and could send one to dreamland -  initially dried seaweed and charred meat followed by amazing wild flowers and strawberry sweets. The palate was refined and precise- sweet red fruits, tar, licorice and minerals. Drying tannins in the background. Long finish. Really well balanced and nothing overdone. .

The late Gianfranco Soldera is a Montalcino legend and was one of its greatest winemakers. The 2006 vintage was one of the last he oversaw. It was also one of the most significant given that halfway through he decided to withdraw his wines as BDM Riserva and labelled them as IGT Toscana instead. As a result you can find 2 variations (or labels) of this wine. I happen to be fortunate to have a few bottles of both left in the store ... maybe i shall open some in a few years to compare and see if there are any actual differences besides the label . .
