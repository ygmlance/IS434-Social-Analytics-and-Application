Basil pork with fried egg will be everyones ‘Go To’ meal  and my ‘Go To’ dish will be the mince pork omelette! As I mention countless times, nothing beats a Thai Omelette! Theres also the Tom Yum Mama which comes with eggs too! Choose between its choices of gravy like the creamy Tom yum to give you that kick!
