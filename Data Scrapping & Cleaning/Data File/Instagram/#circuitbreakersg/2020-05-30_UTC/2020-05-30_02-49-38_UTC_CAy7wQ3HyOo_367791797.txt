Happy Weekend 😃😄😁
Received these nonya kueh from my 大家姐 @jojo_toh_ last night. Thanku again Jojo. ❤️ While heating them up, one of the white rice rolls got so sticky with two ang-ku kueh. Oops, heng... no need social distancing!. Haha 😂 So blessed to have hand-made kueh for breakfast at home! One sweet and one savoury taste 😋😋😋 ... Guess what? I had 2 rice rolls and 1 ang ku kueh after a glass of YL protein soybean milkshake. Burping! 😜 #gratitude #thankfulgratefulblessed #nonyakueh #proteinsoymilkshake #breakfastsaturday #circuitbreakersg #stayathomesg
