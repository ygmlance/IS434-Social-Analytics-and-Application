It’s the end of #circuitbreakersg tomorrow but certainly life hasn’t gone back to the way it used to be.
.
For us at #intobeautysg, June will be a busy month as we’re busy preparing for a #comeback !
.
What’s the comeback? Well, maybe we’ll be moving to a new and improved location for all your beauty needs.... Hmmm, stay tuned to find out!

Watch this space for our latest updates and promotions❤️ Till then, stay safe & beautiful✨.
