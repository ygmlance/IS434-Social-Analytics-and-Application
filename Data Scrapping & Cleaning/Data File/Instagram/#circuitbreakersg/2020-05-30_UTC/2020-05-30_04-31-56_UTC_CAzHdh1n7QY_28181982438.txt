It’s the most amazing feeling to receive a beautiful bouquet of flowers on your special occasion. A birthday, an anniversary, a surprise just to say “I love you” to a person you cherish. ❤️
.
Did you know flowers have their own occasion too? Today is “Water A Flower” day and it’s a day where we can appreciate them for being such a gift from nature to us, by “showering” them with blessings! 
Go ahead, take some time to thank these beautiful creations by watering them, and bringing them a refreshing boost of life today!

P.S: We will resume our business operations from 2 June! Please send those orders in and we are excited to re-start bouquet creations for you! 😊
