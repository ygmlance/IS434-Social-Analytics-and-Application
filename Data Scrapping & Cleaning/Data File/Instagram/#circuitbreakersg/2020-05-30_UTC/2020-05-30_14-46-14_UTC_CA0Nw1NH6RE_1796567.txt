Day 54 of 56 (Circuit Breaker): one of the kiddos goes back to school next week 🥳 and it feels bittersweet because it’s been such a joy & privilege spending so much time with my 2 Chungkins, seeing all their antics 24/7 for the past few weeks and getting laughs out of their “where did that come from?” chats. 
Never did I anticipate that my desire to be able to spend more quality time with my kids to be answered in this way. During this period I’m also thankful that through observation, the kids are more aware of the challenges/stress we face when we’re working (Liam even picked up some ppt skills while watching me churn deck after deck) and have been praying for our work burdens to not affect our health. 
Definitely hope to continue our family active time together in the new norm, appreciating blue skies and rainbows (we saw a gorgeous one while jogging this evening!) 🌈
