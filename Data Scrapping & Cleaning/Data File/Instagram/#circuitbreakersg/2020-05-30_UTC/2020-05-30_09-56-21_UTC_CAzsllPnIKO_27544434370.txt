"In Japanese, Roku translates as the number six. Inside every bottle of Roku Gin, you will find six very special botanicals that are sourced in Japan."⁣

"Not only are Roku Gin’s ingredients of the highest quality, many are also uniquely Japanese and, therefore, best understood by Japanese artisans." ⁣

That explains why it tasted smooth, delicious and refreshing! *Aaahhh*
