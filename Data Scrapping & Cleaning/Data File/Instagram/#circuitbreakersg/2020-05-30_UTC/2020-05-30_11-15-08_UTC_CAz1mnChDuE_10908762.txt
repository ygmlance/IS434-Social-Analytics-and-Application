So I told my husband that I wanna spend my birthday at the beach. ...And so we did. ☀️🌴😎 Thank you all for your kind wishes and endless food deliveries! Circuit breaker birthdays proved that you will get more than 1 cake for your celebration so whoever out there pouting how bad this "lockdown" is, ya'll be missing out. 🤪
