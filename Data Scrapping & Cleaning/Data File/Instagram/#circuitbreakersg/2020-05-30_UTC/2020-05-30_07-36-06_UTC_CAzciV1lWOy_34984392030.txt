🌾Kinetic Sand Sensory Play 🍃
.
.
On days that I don’t feel like doing much play prep, I take out our sensory play tray and fill it with kinetic sand. I then provide J with a variety of sand scoops and tools, shape cutters and containers to play around with! 🥣

He practises scooping, transferring sand into containers, making various shapes etc, and sometimes even scurries off to get his animal figurines or toy cars to create his own story in the sandbox. We have this play contained within the confines of our Funny Funny Play Mat from Korea, and cleaning up after that is a breeze.🌬 .
.
The Kinetic Sand Set and Funny Play Mat can be ordered via Qoo10, and the sensory tray cost us a mere $3+ from Ikea. It comes with a cover too, which you can purchase separately.
