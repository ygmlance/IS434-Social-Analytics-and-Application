Over the last two days, my belly was well-pampered by Chef Stephan's @2015l takeaway/delivery set menu. Each package offers you dinner for 2 people, for 2 nights, at only $180 nett. That works out to be a friendly $45 per person per meal.
.
Each meal has 3 courses, and everything is packaged securely and neatly for you. All you need to do before each meal is some minimal prep following the detailed instructions included. By minimal prep, I really do mean just throwing bags of food into boiling water to heat up, remove food from bags, and put onto plate. I was sent pics of how the dishes are meant to look like at the end, and trust me, this was me already trying my best. I obviously have no talent in plating 😂 but I thoroughly enjoyed trying!
.
While the meals are intended to be dinners over two days, there is nothing stopping you from having a meal for lunch, or serving four people in one go. A vegetarian menu is also available, so everyone is well taken care of. Pictured here are the dishes from my second meal:
.
▪️Pic 1: Roast Beef. Lovely beefy flavours with a creamy, slightly tart sauce gribiche for balance. The asparagus and endives added texture and the nasturtium leaf rounded things off nicely with a mild peppery nod.
▪️Pic 2: Chicken Saltimbocca. Surprisingly moist roast chicken wrapped in prosciutto, sitting atop some yummy barley that has been prepared like risotto. I've never had pickled pumpkin, and if these babies were anything to go by, I want more.
▪️Pic 3: Chocolate & Pistachio. Pistachio financier cake stacked up with milk chocolate mouse and chopped pistachios. Rich yet light, made more exciting by aromatic rose petals. We had a lot of fun flinging the dark chocolate sauce onto the plates!
.
There are new menus every week, so things never get boring. If you have allergies or any dietary restrictions, just let Chef know.

Thank you Stephan for being a sweetheart as usual and making sure my meals were all cooked through and had nothing from my no-go list 😘
