“Look at the birds in the air. They don’t plant or harvest or store food in barns. But your heavenly Father feeds the birds. And you know that you are worth much more than the birds.” Matthew‬ ‭6:26‬ ‭ICB‬‬⁣

“「‭ 你们看天上的飞鸟，它们不种，不收，也不在仓里积存粮食，你们的天父尚且养活它们，难道你们还不如飞鸟贵重吗？ ”⁣
‭‭马太福音‬  6:26‬ ‭CCB‬‬⁣

One more week to go back to school. I think I’m gonna miss this time of “homeschooling” them.. haha! Was overwhelming at first with work/meeting commitment, but as time goes... I’m enjoying all these Circuit Breaker process actually. ⁣

Everything in life goes back to choices 🥰 I’m glad that we have always chosen to have a heart of thanksgiving. Thank God for such a lovely and great reminder to us all!⁣
