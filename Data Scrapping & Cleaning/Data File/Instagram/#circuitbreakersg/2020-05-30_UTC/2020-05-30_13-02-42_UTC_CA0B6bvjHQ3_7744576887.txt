.
This circuit breaker has turned us all into Masterchef. We can see how people are sharing their baked products online and trying something new in the kitchen every day. Or if we are not seen cooking or baking in our kitchen, we are probably out doing our grocery run.

However, there are still certain snacks that can't be found in Singapore and one of them is the highly-raved Cookie Pop Popcorn Oreo that is America's favourite stay-home movie treat. Why not try replicating your own Oreo popcorn since we're all cooped up at home! üòç
