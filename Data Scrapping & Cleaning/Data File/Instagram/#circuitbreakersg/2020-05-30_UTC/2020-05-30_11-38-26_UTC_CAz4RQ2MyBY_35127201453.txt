Ordered their signature 招牌菜 San Lou mee Hoon, fried garlic chili clams, deep fried fermented bean pork belly and fried crunchy lotus root with French beans. Food too oily and I have to reheat or airfry the pork to make it more crispy! San Lou mee hoon supposed to be crispy or like ‘chao ta’ or slightly burnt but it turned soggy. Their garlic Chili clams is da bomb, love the garlic and the sweetness of the clam sauce! Hope to try their food again after circuit breaker!  #circuitbreakersg#
