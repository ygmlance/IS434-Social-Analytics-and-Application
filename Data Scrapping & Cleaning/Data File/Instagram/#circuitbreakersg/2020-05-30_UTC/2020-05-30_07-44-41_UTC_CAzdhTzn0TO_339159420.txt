#Circuitbreakersg Day 54
.
Blood orange hues in the sky this morning, welcoming sunrise
.
I haven't been sleeping well, waking up at 4/5am and struggling to fall back to sleep quite often
.
This morning, I decided to just get out of bed after tossing from 5am. I was rewarded with such strong hues greeting me .
