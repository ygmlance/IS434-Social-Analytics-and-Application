I can sing a rainbow, sing a rainbow, sing a rainbow too! 🌈 M spotted a rainbow during our evening stroll and exclaimed: ‘Look Mama, a rainbow!!!!’ Definitely perk my day! Recently there have been many sightings of rainbow.. ☺️Maybe it’s God’s way of saying: Persevere on during this tough time, the pot of Gold is waiting for you at the other end. ❤️ #rainbow #colors #spreadloveandpositivity #beautyinnature #stroll #timewithmykids #circuitbreakersg #covid19 #surpriseview #simplethingsthatmakesmehappy❤️
