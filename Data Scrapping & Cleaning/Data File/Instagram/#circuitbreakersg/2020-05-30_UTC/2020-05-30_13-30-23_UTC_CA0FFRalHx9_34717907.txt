In teochew, "this burger is so big! look at me try to fit it into my mouth!" made wholemeal brioche buns, first time making homemade mayo as well (highly recommend making your own mayo and not buying store bought anymore ;)), beer batter onion rings, homemade coleslaw, and a nutsbutts brand of aioli!

may or may not have finished a beer or two while making the beer batter ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ #circuitbreakersg #makingmemories
