I love capturing reflections especially on water. Somehow it makes the object more fluid and look as if it’s painted. Do you prefer the coloured version or the B&W version? :) In life, it’s also important to always reflect on both the good and the bad. It gives life meaning and brings about greater learning about myself and people around me. #reflections #mirrorimage #shotoniphone #photographyiphone #beautyinnature #circuitbreakersg #capturethemoment
