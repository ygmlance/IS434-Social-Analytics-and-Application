[Resilience - Down but not out]

As the 8 weeks circuit breaker comes to an end soon, it was great and thankful to close the weekend off with 2 interesting virtual red box sessions, breakout room facilitating of Phasing It Conversation session 1 by YCS and CHAT; and mental health cluster bonding session. Thanks yo!âœŒ Many changes have taken place for a lot of us in this period: physical, mental, routines, interests, future plans, you name it. Individually, we may feel blue to different degrees as a result of it (like the first photo), but let's tune up the 'colour temperature' and get that warm feeling of hope with things slowly getting better each passing day.

We can be down, but we are not out. ðŸ’ª
