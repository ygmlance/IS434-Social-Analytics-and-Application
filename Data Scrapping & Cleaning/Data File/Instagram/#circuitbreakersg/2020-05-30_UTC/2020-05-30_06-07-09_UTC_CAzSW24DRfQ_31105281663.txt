Years ago at a new job, I met someone who never drank water.
And I mean PURE, CLEAN, H2O.
“It’s tasteless, why bother?” And picks up a can of soda.
At that point, we were trying to film “the benefits of hydration”, hence this photo.

After months of working together, I decided to work up the courage...
“𝐸ℎ, your breath smells 𝑙𝑒ℎ!”
No joke.
Halitosis is a major issue when you’re not well hydrated!

After trying for weeks to explain that soda does not equal water, that person finally gave a shot to have pure clean water only.

And weeks later,
“Wow, I actually feel much better with plain water! No more soda from now on! Or maybe, only when I have KFC” 😅🤦🏻‍♀️
.
So - during this #circuitbreakersg have you been drinking enough water? I’m certain many of us now know how our breaths are under the mask 😷🤣

Keep hydrated everyone, not only for your breath, but for all your body’s cells - they need clean water to survive!! 🌟✌️🧬
