Bill Evans Trio - Sunday At The Village Vanguard, 1961. This was an interesting copy I picked up on one of my trips to Japan. I’ve not seen this version before. Sunday on the front cover and #waltzfordebby at the back. It’s a 1966 Japan only compilation on #fontanarecords label. Both albums in full in one package. Regarded as one of the best live jazz recordings in history. Nothing else to add.  #billevanstrio #scottlafaro #paulmotian #sundayatthevillagevanguard
