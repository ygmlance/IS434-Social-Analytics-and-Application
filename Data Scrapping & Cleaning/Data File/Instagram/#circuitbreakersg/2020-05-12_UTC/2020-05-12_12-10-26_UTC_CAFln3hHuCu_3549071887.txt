CB Day 35

My precious pasta sauce.. one and only can available at home that I kept till now. Pasta and pasta sauce have been flying off the shelves like hot commodity since circuit breaker started and itâ€™s so hard to find. 
Enjoying my simple quick cooked  bolognese pasta with IKEA meatballs.  A must have in my freeze that is also running low. Freezer is getting empty too. Hanging there.. another 2.5 wks to go..... hopefully.
