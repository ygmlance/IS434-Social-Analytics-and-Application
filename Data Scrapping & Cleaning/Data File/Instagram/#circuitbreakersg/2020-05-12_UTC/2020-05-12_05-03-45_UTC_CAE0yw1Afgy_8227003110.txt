Swipe for a glimpse of what volunteering looks like at HCSA during this circuit breaker period! With safe distancing measures & other restrictions in place, we continue to find alternatives for volunteers to support our beneficiaries in various areas. We couldn't be more grateful for those who have stepped up especially in times like these ðŸ˜Š

Drop us if a message or email if you have a suggestion on how you wish to volunteer!
