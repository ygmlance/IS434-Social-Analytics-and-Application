“Children should be allowed to get bored so they can develop their innate ability to be creative. “ - an education expert says.

I read an article 📰 about “Why Boredom is Good for your Kid” when I was pregnant with Valeris and I saw a couple of similar articles recently. I thought it’s a good read and wanna share my takeaway points with all of you. ❤️

The best way to help your child 👧🏻👦🏻with boredom is to do nothing at all. Tolerating boredom is an important skill for your child to acquire. If you start fretting when your child is bored, this will only reinforce the complaints.

Don’t react excessively. This way, the child will learn that boredom is something they can learn to cope with.

DM me for the links if you want to read the full articles. 😊 Don’t be a stranger!
