Looking forward, but staying in the moment.

Last night, it crossed my mind that we have less than 3 weeks of #circuitbreakersg left, and the way I thought of it was “there are ONLY less than 3 weeks of CB”. I felt sadness with respect to my kids and how much time we’ve spent together and how things will be different once life ramps up again. We are literally together 24/7 and at times this drives me so crazy, frustrated, irritated, agitated, annoyed above and beyond so much so I had to take a “day off” from them last week and no one could speak to me for the day, and I’ve already warned the family that the second travel restrictions are lifted, I’m outta here for at least 2 weeks 😂 But, regardless of all the chaos at home, I am happy we had this experience, thankful for the next 3 weeks of #stayinghome, and I hope to make the rest of this time as memorable as can be for the family. I know life won’t go back to normal right away, things will slowly pick up, but before we know it, this weird first part of 2020 will be a fading memory. .
