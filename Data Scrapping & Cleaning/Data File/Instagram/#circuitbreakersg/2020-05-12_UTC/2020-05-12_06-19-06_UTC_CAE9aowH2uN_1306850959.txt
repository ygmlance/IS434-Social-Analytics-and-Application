🏠Happiness is a hug after loneliness. Is sunlight after storm. Spring after winter’s ravages. The lights of home. 🏠 I think we are all looking forward to happiness after CB. Reopening of all food and retail shops, gatherings with families and friends, social interaction... For now, happiness is treasuring the time spent at home, and to venture on new stuff, which you didn’t used to have the time to. Today, I had my maiden experience at creating food art! ☺️ It wasn’t intentional but just 1 thought leading to another and another. It started with just wanting to fry an egg to wrap up the hotdog bun and gems biscuits to make the plate more colourful. Then, the gem biscuits look like flowers. 🤣 Then the food art happened unknowingly: plating gem biscuits as flowers; using chocolate syrup to make flower stems; green tea milk spread to make the leaves; strawberry syrup to make little hearts, and more to make little flower buds; finally some chocolate decoration to decorate the flower bed. Today is actually one of those days that I don’t feel like working and was contemplating taking leave. I’m glad that this food art experience occurred and I had a very therapeutic time decorating my breakfast. 🥰It’s also one of the rare breakfasts which I a bit can’t bear to eat. 🤣 I hope seeing this brought you some smiles. Have a good day everyone! ❤️
