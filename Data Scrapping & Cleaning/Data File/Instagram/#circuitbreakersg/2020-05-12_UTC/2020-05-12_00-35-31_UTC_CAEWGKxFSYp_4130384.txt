I can be very aunty because I will check out for any good deals and sometimes I can be forgetful when it comes to paying bills. I recently found out that with DBS PayLah!, I can settle my bills and utilities in one go! Furthermore, my IRAS is due and I can pay via the app too. Yay! So convenient and user friendly during this CB and even after. The app also listed on-going promo deals with participating merchants. Psst: Use ‘PLFD’ when you checkout on Foodpanda with PayLah! and receive free delivery! #DBSPayLah #JustPayLah
