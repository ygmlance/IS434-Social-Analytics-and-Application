Day 36 of CB -  decided to drive to MacDonald's drive-thru at Sengkang Sports Centre. saw a long Q of cars when we arrived 😱 decided to walk in and dabao instead. uncle (MacD staff) manning the car Q was telling us it's a better idea. at 1 time the resturant only allow in 6 customers. it took me less than 20mins from ordering to collecting my breakfast items. well it's definately much faster than the drive-thru 😁 have a beautiful WFH Tuesday everyone -
