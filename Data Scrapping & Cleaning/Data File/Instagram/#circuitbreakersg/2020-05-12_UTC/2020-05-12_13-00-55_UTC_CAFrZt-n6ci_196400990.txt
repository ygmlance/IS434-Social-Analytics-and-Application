Dinner this evening, was another attempt at Rochor Mee, or Fried Hokkien Mee. This time, i had fresh prawns and squid, and also used some prawn stock to help boost the flavour. Now, all i need to get it “perfect” is some Sambal Belachan! Delicious! 😋 #rochormee #friedhokkienmee #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
