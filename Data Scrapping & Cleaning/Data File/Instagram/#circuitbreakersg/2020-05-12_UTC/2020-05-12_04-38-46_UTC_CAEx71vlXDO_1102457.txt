#CircuitBreakerSg Day 36, #WFH Week 6! Today I skipped breakfast and made a big breakfast for lunch instead! What’s on my plate:

1. Thick and fluffy hotcake made from #PrimaFlour pancake premix
2. Chicken burger patty with rosemary & thyme from @sadia.sg 
3. Sunny side up from @nuyolksg egg
4. Hashbrown from #Farmland

All good to go with a shot of nespresso! Happy Tuesday everyone! Stay safe and healthy! 3 more weeks to go! 💪🏻
