There's a lot of things in life we cant change. We cant change the direction of the wind or storm, but we can adjust our  propeller to reach our destination! ♥️👍🏻
.
We need to do what's hard now in order to enjoy what's beautiful later! 🥰👍🏻
.
Remember, a smooth sail never made a skilled sailor! 😍👍🏻
.
Life can be harder, but we need to fuel and power our positivity to survive through this coronavirus storm! We cant change the environment and the world situation, but we can adjust our mindset to wait this through. ♥️👍🏻
.
Stay safe and our destination is just right in front! Hang in there... 🥰👍🏻
