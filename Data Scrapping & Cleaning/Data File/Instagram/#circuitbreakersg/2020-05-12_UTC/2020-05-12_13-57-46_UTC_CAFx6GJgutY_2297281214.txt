Inspired by the famous @jayfaibangkok, I tried out my take on their crab omelette tonight... Looked absolutely nothing like the popular beautiful fluffy omelette that they dish out in the Bangkok eatery... Oh well, there's room for improvement and I'm still fairly pleased with it...
Not sick of the oven-baked Bovmite chicken, @iamivanlau requested for that over soy sauce chicken to accompany the crab omelette... I then pulled out the chap chye that is always better when soaking in its own sauce for 1-2 days and reheated it to complete day 36's dinner... üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
