Day 36 of circuit breaker, Leodys learning his A to Z again. I am so proud of my boy, in just 8 days, he has learn 21 out of 26 alphabet letters. That time he was still struggling with less than half of the alphabets. Nowadays when he see ABC video, he will immediately shout out loud the letters. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #hbl #homebasedlearning #atoz #learningabc #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
