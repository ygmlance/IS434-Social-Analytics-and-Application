“Staying Home with Grandpa & Grandma” 05
🧵 🧵 🧵 “留在家中缝口罩. Home-made Reusable Masks”: Watercolour illustration on cold-pressed paper.
😊😉😊
Grandpa and Grandma know that everyone must mask up when leaving the house. Kiddo knows that Grandma has some fabric leftover from sewing his baby cousin’s pillow, and has a good idea for reusing the fabric.
Here’s Kiddo idea number 5: Repurpose the fabric and sew a mask! Time passes fast!
