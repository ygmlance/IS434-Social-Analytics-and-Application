If Champagne says "let's get this party started",
Cabernet Sauvignon is like "I've got you" any situation, anyday, anywhere! 
I'm quite the novice when it comes to South African wines so when a few days back we were ordering wines (our most favourite thing to do🤣), and I stumbled across this wine; I quickly ordered it! And then,  Saturday night + Juicy burger + this red friend=bliss🍷

Colour🌈: Deep ruby
Nose👃: Black berry, herbaceous, green pepper, tobacco, cedar
Palate👅: Berry, plum, coffee, tobacco, leather. Medium plus body, medium acidity, medium tannins, medium plus finish. 
My Thoughts ®️: Why haven't I been drinking more of South African wines? This smells a bit like Napa Cabs owing to the green pepper notes. It is very fruit forward, but also flaunts the ageing in the tertiary notes like coffee, tobacco, leather. More of these will find a cosy place in my chiller!
