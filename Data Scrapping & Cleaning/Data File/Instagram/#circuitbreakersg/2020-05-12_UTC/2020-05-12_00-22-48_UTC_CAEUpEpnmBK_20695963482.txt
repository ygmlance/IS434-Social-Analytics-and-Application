I used to be apologetic about ‘being down’ during working hours. Feeling tired, unfocused or emotionally-off was wasted time and ‘unprofessional’ to me. My antagonism toward such moments brought me unnecessary anxiety, which ultimately led to dental and sleep issues.

This #quarantine period has brought up echoes of such moments for me. I am grateful and relieved to say that I am able to care for myself much better. I embrace my downtime as part of life, part of work. I stop and mindfully engage with my thoughts, emotions and body when i need to, instead of ignoring them and ’powering through’. It helps me to accept the inevitable highs and lows of life, and actually gives me more confidence for the immediate future.

How are you around self care? Is it the same or different from me? How has it changed during this time? Please share!
