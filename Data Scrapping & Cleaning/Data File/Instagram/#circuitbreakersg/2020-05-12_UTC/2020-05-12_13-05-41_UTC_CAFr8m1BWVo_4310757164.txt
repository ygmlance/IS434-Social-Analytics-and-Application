#circuitbreakersg :  Busy bee day 🐝

I have tip for everyone who feels drained working from home by looking after family too. First, have 15mins of the allocated breakfast time in the morning with no phone or tv, I felt so relaxed after having mindful meals. Second, I say this to myself these days that need not prepare a heavy full meal Lunch each day which will eventually drain our energy, so here I present my #lunchplate as an example with you all. Third, in the evening around 5pm(if at all no continuous meetings 😝) take another 20mins of tea time refreshment break and spend that time with the loved ones instead of being on the phone. Hope this small tips will help will be useful, if so please comment below 😇.
