Day 36 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (12 May 2020) - #nofilter #dinner #beerbattered #fishandchips using #tigerradler with #homemade #tartarsauce - Only thing that was #yummy was the #tartarsauce because I had a #kitchendisaster when the plug of my #deepfryer burnt into the socket and almost started a fire while I was frying the #fries a second time. Had to fry the fish in a pan on my ceramic hob and it wasn't close to hot enough; ended up with both fish and chips not crispy. ðŸ˜­ Still posting cos this is #reallife where #shithappens #stayhomewithascott #homecooking
