Having these two at home with me involves lots of laughter, mess, chaos, screams and fighting. Looking back at all these pictures from home is one that is such a blessing in disguise. One I’ll probably never trade with. ⁣

What was my Mother’s Day gift you ask me, I’ll say it was re-connecting with Rey. She’s always had a problem expressing herself and her feelings. Her meltdowns were un stoppable and we used to send her to timeout thinking that was the best solution. ⁣
⁣
Not saying it’s not the correct way but we definitely didn’t use it in the right way. The last couple of weeks I’ve adopted a new method learning from this book I was reading “no-drama discipline” which was getting to her level to calm her down, knowledge her feelings and to HTHT with her. Took us a long time with lots of patience and grace but I’m finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. ⁣
⁣
Now she comes up to me to tell me how she’s feeling whether it’s feeling sad or happy. It’s soo much easier to talk to her with so much lesser meltdowns! ⁣
⁣
Incredibly amazed and thankful at the same time. Jude is on another level, going through his terrible twos which I’ve yet to figure him out. ⁣
⁣
I can’t stressed how important these moments of meltdowns are in parenting, so much more than the activities I do with them or what I cook for them. These are the most important moments where you get to shape and define them, teach them to respond and not react. These are lifelong skills they’ll never be able to learn elsewhere. ⁣

Being a present parent I think it not so much about the quantity of time you spend with them, but how you respond in these exact crucial moments, the best lessons for our kids. ⁣
