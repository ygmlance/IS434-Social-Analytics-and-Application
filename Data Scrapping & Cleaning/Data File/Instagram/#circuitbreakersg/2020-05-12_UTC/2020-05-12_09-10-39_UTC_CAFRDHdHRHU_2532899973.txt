Come Together... come together as one. Know that song? - I feel that this picture is over exposed somehow. Anyway, no time to edit just wanted to show you how happy I am with my plant platter. Not Nasi Ambeng platter (gawd.... I miss that) but plant platter.  Placed all the plants I got from @rabbitislandsg into one tray and now it has become my table arrangement. I hope I don’t kill them. Maybe one or two but I think I can manage this. Now, I don’t know the plant names 😝 Never good with names. Human, plants etc.

UPDATE: @maltlea has helped me with the plant ID! It’s on my insta story. Thank you Serene!!
