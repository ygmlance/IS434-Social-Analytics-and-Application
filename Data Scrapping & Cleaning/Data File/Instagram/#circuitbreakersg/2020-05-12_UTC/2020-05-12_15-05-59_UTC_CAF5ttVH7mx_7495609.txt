Not much of activity today cos mama here has a very bad back pain. So did an “old people” activity- planting 🌱. Asked the kids what they wana plant & their answers were “tomato 🍅，lemon 🍋, Apple 🍎...” already had all those seeds dried becos previously we learnt about seeds. So let see if they are lucky to get those growing 😅.
