#circuitbreakersg Day 36 Fasting Day 19:

The G just loosen the CB measures by allowing essential services like the hair saloons to resume services today. 
I made a small procurement for a hair clipper weeks ago. It arrived today, and I immediately preyed on my son’s blossoming straight ahbeng-like hair. I regretted not settling for the better known Wahl brand clippers but scrooged on a China made Xiaomi Enchen. The clipping was fine, wireless and all but only had up to 1.5” guard. 
Anyways, do you guys put faith in China products for such precision tool? Did you also, like me, purchased any hair grooming equipment online?
