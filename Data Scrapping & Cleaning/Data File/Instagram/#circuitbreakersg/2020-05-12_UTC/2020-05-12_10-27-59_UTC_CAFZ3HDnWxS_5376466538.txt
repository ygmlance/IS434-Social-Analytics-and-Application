Many ladies can’t wait to rush to beauty salons to have their facial done after circuit breaker. Luckily I’ve long brought the spa-like experiences to my home and save me a lot of time and money. This little device comes with four interchangeable conductor attachments that allow me to target the face, body, spot and scalp areas – a single device, with multiple uses. Just 5 minutes is all I need to restore skin’s natural vibrancy by removing impurities and promoting cellular energy.
