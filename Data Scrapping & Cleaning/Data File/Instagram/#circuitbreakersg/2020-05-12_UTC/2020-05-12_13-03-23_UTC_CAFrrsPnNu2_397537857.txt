#CircuitBreakerSG D-36

We're having one of our favourite fish tonight; Pan-fried Salmon with homemade Teriyaki Sauce. Love the crispy skin most.

The next dish is another family's favourite; Chinese Sausage with golden Garlic bits. Render the fats from the Lup Cheong first before adding in the minced garlic. Dish out once the garlic is crispy. Do give it a try!

Lastly Napa Cabbage with Wood Fungus.

Enjoy your #dinner too üíù
