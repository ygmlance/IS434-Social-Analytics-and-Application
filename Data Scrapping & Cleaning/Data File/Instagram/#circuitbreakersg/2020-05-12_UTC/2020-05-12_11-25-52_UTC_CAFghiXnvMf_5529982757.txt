Long before bubble tea or bingsu gained popularity in Southeast Asia, there was an iced dessert that was the staple go-to after a hearty meal —— #chendol!
A fun fact:
It is believed that this cold dessert derives its name from a word “jendol”.
The word jendol in Javanese, Indonesian and Sundanese means “bulging” or “bumping”. Cendol, lives to up to its name in recreating the bumpy sensations that arises in the stomach when green-worm like jellies (made out of rice flour) are swallowed hahaha 😂
A sweet, tasty and delightfully satisfying #dessert! Day 36 of #Circuitbreakersg
