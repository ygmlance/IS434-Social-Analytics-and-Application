[20.20 May 11: Circuit Breaker Day 35] Cookies for my cookie monsters!

Recently, there is a recipe for  #DoubleTreeCookies going around, so here we go. I learnt that the actual recipe is more on the sweet side. I tweaked the recipe a little:
👉🏻 Reduce the sugar by 3/4 cup
👉🏻 Scoop 1 Tablespoon instead of 3 Tablespoons and baked it with the same duration.

Realised that it is more on the crunchy side. I shortened the baking duration to about 12 mins if you like a soft baked texture.

Overall, it still tasted good! I kept aside some dough too to add cranberries in it! Ta-dah! We are all happy with our preferences!
