ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬SG Food: Got my burger fix from @dirtybunsg last week. Thanks for sending over the fluffy and soft buns soaked up all the sauces and juices stuffed with juicy meat patty and cheese. They are available in Single Patty S$8/ S$11 as a meal and Double Patty S$11/ S$14 as a meal. 
Swipe for the full menu. Itâ€™s pretty good deal and enjoy 10% discount for self pick up or flat fee of delivery surcharge is applicable. #hzfooddiary #dirtybunsg
