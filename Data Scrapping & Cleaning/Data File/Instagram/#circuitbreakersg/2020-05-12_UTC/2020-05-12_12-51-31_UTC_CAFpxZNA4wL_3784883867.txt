Have you been losing motivation during the #CircuitBreakerSg period? I hate looking at Instagram for the longest time because it’s full of stuff that makes me feel inferior. The posts made me feel like I wasn’t doing enough and that I should be “boasting” about my results. 
Then I recalled a quote which I used to stand by. “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”... aim for goals and little milestones so that you can hit two birds with one stone. Do something today that will also benefit you in the future. Whether it be working on the foundation to building your dream job, saving money for a rainy day (or retirement), using sunblock (or better yet, quitting smoking) to save your future skin. 
There are all these things you can do for your future self that can actually feel good in the moment. #BePosiTiff
