During the COVID-19 period, many of our clients and their family members' livelihood are affected due to Circuit Breaker restrictions. To provide support during this difficult time, our Client Services team has been calling clients to check in on them and giving out NTUC FairPrice vouchers, hand sanitizers and masks for clients in need. We would like to especially thank Yuen Law LLC and their network contacts as well as a GDS client (who contributed his full solidarity payout of $600) to provide this much-needed support to GDS clients!
