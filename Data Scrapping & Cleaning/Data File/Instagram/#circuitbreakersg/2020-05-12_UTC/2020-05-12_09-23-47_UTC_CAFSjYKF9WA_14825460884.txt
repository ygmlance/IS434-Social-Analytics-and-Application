@starbucks has the most delicious assortment of cakes & beverages in Singapore, love their matcha latte, did some errands today during the circuit breaker, had to grab a matcha latte & almond croissant from them today, quite worth it ðŸ˜Š Do you guys go out for beverages & a pastry @starbucks these days? Relaxing right now & missing these good times of going out comfortably. Stay safe & blessed my dear friends ðŸ’œ #starbuckssingapore #cakes #beverages #circuitbreakersg
