Day 34. Woke up at the perfect timing to catch sunrise. Lunch - Mr. bought chicken and mutton biryani for the whol family. Dad asked for something flavourful. Baked salted croissant after a 1-yr break. Both Japanese bread flour and new oven work very well. Managed to have me-time as I played the strategy PC game 'Pharoah'. Not really me-time since the littlest one decided to stick to me. Tomorrow is mid-week. Time really flies! #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #spendtimewithfamily #homebake #saltedcroissants #skyisapalette #skyporn #instadaily
