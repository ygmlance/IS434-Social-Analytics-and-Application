â˜†Family Art Jammingâ˜†
What an energising session with @nelliengoo this afternoon! We were on a Pokemon theme for our art jamming session and the kids were all ready with their pokemons drawn out right before session started. Nellie and her family are a bunch of art enthusiasts and I like the creative flow throughout the session as we study our reference photos and discussed the colours to use for our respective artworks.

First, we worked on the subjects - the sequence of cutting the stencils and blending in the colours for the parts. Next we explored ways to do the background. All 3 of them had different background to express their Pokemons in their unique ways. It was really satisfying for me to hear how pleased they are with their final artwork!

Thanks Nellie, Karen and the kiddos - Laurel, Seth and Bon (who dozed off halfway ðŸ¤£) for an afternoon filled with laughter and silly jokes!

See you at the next workshop!
