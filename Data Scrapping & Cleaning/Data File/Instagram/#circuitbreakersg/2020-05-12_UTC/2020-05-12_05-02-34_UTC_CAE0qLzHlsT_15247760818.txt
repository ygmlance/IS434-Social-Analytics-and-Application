MacDonald’s was back this Monday and so are we! Ronald is busy (not my Mac-loving bro by the same name 😝), so we co-created our own version of the Mac meal with BBQ chicken patty burger 🍔 with caramelised mango 🥭, white onions 🧅, mozzarella and cheddar cheese, butterhead lettuce 🥬, apple fries 🍎🍟 and fruity burgers 🍎🥑🍊🍔 , banana mango 🍌🥭smoothie made with @meijiseikasingapore honey yoghurt 🍯🥛(haha tricking the hubs into loving yoghurt🤪) made by yours truly and to complete the meal like a good Happy Meal, yummy Granny Smith apple tarts 🍏🥧 made personally by the hubby on Mother’s Day, but it felt more like Wife’s Day 😉 as he did everything by himself, including washing up. Super rare occasion indeed❣️
.
Here’s our homemade version of a complete Mac meal with burger + fries + apple pie + milkshake! .
Mac meal inspired by @sgagsg and an online image - coincidentally already planned this ahead of the re-opening announcement and hubby said he wants to bake one day before, perfect! .
Verdict by the hubs who could not stop smiling at the carved apple: A* for effort!
.
Apple tarts inspired by @netflixsg ‘s Nadiya’s Time To Eat (the hubs watched and said “this looks easy, I can do it!” 🤣) - our own variation with caramelised honey and coconut 🥥 brown sugar crust... @scoopwholefoods_sg’s coconut brown sugar tastes so fine with an aromatic caramel flavour! The tangy green apple jam is from Scoop too. .
Verdict by me: Clever shortcut to create your own pastries at home with filo pastry sheets. The palm-sized tarts are wholesome and delicious (after brushing tart tops with honey and brown sugar, else it initially looked like a wanton and tasted slightly like prata 😅), with a hint of tartness from green apples, mixed spice, fruits and nuts. .
Ba da ba ba ba, I’m loving it. 🍔🍟🍎🥛

Now back to going to @macdonald_singapore for the real deal! .
