Day 36/56â€¢Stayhome Dinner 
Late post of last night's dinner, it was a hit with the Martians...ä½¬M did comment on why I cooked so little ðŸ˜¥ the steam cod was so good that it was mostly shared among Kbros... Mini K liked the cabbage fishballs soup, I cooked an ikan-bilis garlic stock w/o added seasoning. The soup was filled with sweetness from the wongbok & fishballs plus a dash of huadiao wine before switching off the fire! Gotten the Teochew fishballs from #HaiSiaSeafood , really had bits of fish meat in the fishballs!
Together with Mapo Tofu, I'll share more on this super easy dish next time...this post is too lengthy! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ .
