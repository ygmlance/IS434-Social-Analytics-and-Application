role played again

making food for me, sleeping with her baby, and 🤦🏻‍♀️took out uniform to wear for both of them 
Letter hunt activity made from toilet roll inspired from @happytotshelf . She loved it but had difficulty moving around to find the letters. Haha. She even found the letter, recognised them and matched them to the ones on the window

Cleaning the letters on the window inspired from @ayunnisamokri 😂😂 Didn’t know our window has such a good use until I saw her doing so much activity at the window. Hehe.
