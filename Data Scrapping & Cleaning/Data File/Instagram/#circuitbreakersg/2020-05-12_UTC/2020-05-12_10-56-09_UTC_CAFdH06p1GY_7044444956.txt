There truly is no better way to cheer yourself up than by actually getting dressed 🤗stepping outside and enjoying nature! 🌸 I made this shirt dress by @merchantandmills using @alexanderhenryfabrics last spring for a wedding but it was raining cats & dogs on the day so I changed my mind! I tweaked the hem to make it a bit longer & I got rid of the curved shirt hem which was a great idea at the time but think I might have to change it back! 🙄 ✂️ 🧵 .
