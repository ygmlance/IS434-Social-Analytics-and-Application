This Circuit Breaker was a chance for many of us to unlock new skills. For me, I decided to learn how to improve on my videos, as a gift and challenge for myself.

After lots of research, procrastination and edits, I finally came up with something that I am okay with. Yes that includes some imperfections that I can live with hahaha, for I have learnt to be a little less harsh on myself.

Ten years from now, regardless of whether I would be amazed at this item or whether I would cringe in embarrassment 😂, I believe the process of creation and learning is something uniquely yours and yours alone. 🤗
