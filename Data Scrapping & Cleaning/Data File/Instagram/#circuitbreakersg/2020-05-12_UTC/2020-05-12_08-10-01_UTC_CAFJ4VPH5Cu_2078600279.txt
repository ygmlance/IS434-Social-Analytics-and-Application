How can we counteract negative thought patterns? How can we manage the intrusion of technology? How do we manifest our goals?

In case you missed last week's fireside chat between @thecrystalstream, @gregorlimlange and @krys_say, we've summarised their responses to these questions, and more. 
In Part 2 of Thriving In A Crisis, we're progressing to a free, mini-workshop on Zoom where you will learn to rewire your brain for happiness, calm and focus with neuroscience and psychology tools. Experience a range of original, immersive exercises and take away a practical self-care plan that will help you level up your ability to thrive even in the midst of a crisis.

To register for Part 2 of the series happening 7.30pm SGT, Wed, 13 May, hit the link in our bio: @bluesky.escapes
