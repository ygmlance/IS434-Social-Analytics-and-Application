Today's workout was not too tough though I have to go easy on the knees. Was expecting to work out more maybe cos last week's sweat sesh were all more than 1 hr! So included ChloeTing's 3 weeks lean arms challenge video as well to have the upper body working. The knees are suffering so let's hope they get some rest today. 
Happy Tuesday and I realised the holidays went by so fast. I have work to do but I have family to tend to. 
I'm going to clear the toys today and hopefully, we have more to give away than to keep! (but my kids seem to be hoarders!) Argh! 
Haha..and the birthday sign is up still!
