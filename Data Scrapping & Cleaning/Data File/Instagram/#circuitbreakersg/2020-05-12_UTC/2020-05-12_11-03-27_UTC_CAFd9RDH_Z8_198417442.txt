💖One thing remains constant... My passion & my dream.🔥💖
Countries that have opened up started seeing spike in new cases of #covid19 again. And some countries have been extending their lockdown measures. Competitions are being pushed back to end of the year. But without a vaccine, it is unlikely that things will go back to normal this year. 
It has been a good break during this #circuitbreakersg period with my family and bf constantly feeding me. 能吃就是福. 🥰 
But off season does not mean time to slack off. Weeks out unknown... It is all out of my control. But what I am in control is making the best out of every single day. Day by day, week by week, month by month, using the additional time gained to improve my package. 💪🏻 #currentphysique #currentcondition #sgfitness #fitness #sgphysique #fitgirl #girlswholift #passion #dreambig #improvementseason #bikinifitness #bikinicompetitor #bikiniathlete #girlswholift #girlswhogym #girlswithmuscle #sgunited #stayhome #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #fightagainstcoronavirus #fitnessmotivation
