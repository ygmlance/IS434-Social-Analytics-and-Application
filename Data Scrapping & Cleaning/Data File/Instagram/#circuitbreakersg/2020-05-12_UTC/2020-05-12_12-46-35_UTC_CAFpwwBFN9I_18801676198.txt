Today's lifeskills lesson ~ Making bread from scratch! Reading the recipe, weighing out ingredients, kneading, shaping are essential lifeskills & there are alot of learning involved! Lil Jae has decided to take on this task of baking bread for tomorrow's breakfast! Mummy was the assistant...even though the shaping was not perfect, but he tried his best! The taste of the bread was good, nonetheless! 👏👏 #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #sgbakes #lifeskillsforkids #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday36 #bread #bakingwithkids
