Happy in my belly!🤰🏻 #homemade 九鲜 is the best! Lesser sugar and u can make them into any shape u want 😂 these are really easy to do, u just need either taro/ sweet potato (cut and steamed), knead them with tapioca flour, some elbow grease and boil them. I love how the 4 colors came together 😍 the small balls are also really cute! U can make them in advance and zng ur own homemade bubble tea with the mini round ones 🤤
