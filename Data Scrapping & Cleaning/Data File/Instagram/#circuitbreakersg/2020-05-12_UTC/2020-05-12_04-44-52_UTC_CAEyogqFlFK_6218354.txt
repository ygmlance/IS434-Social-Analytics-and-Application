Our mini Mother’s Day Photoshoot at home.

My Paati (grandma) was especially excited to get dressed up when I asked them if they wanted to take some photos. She even prepared her outfit the night before hehe. 😀

Having been away from home for so long, I am so grateful to have been able to spend this time with my Mum and Paati. They make sure that I’m fed and okay; giving me space when I’m feeling down and watching movies and shows with me to bide time. My Mum has even been helping me out with my crafting.☺️

We of course miss the rest of our family. Can’t wait to have you all with us again @vishh25 @sayanmikasa @sellasellamuthoo @rhea.suresh @thoughtfulwisegirl @wendell.cornwall and Suresh!

How did you guys celebrate Mother’s Day this year?
