It is very hard to find authentic Thai food in SG that can make me go OMG Shiok! @homaroythai is so far the best Thai food I’ve tried. I don’t post review just because the food/product is sponsored. I politely rejected some food/product brand that I wont post the review because it is not up to MY standard & I dont want to dissapoint my followers.

So trust me, if you are looking for authentic Thai Food, check out @homaroythai. They sent me their Mother’s Day Menu last week. Aden and Amelia don’t take spicy food so they added fried vermicelli and chicken wings for them. I can’t comment which is our favourite because all the dishes are shiok. Just a little disapointment to the fried seabass with sweet and sour sauce. It came slightly hard and cold. But they explained to me it’s supposed to taste crispy and i’ll definitely try dining in after the CB. Kids loves the fried vermicelli, chicken wings and mooping. They also collaborated with Ann Chin Popiah to include a mini party set in the menu.
