#humpbackgrouper #老鼠斑 One of the most prized groupers! Taste sweet and texture is sooooo Q. 口感好到没话说，果然是名不虚传的好斑！

I paired the fillets with the simplest congee for lunch today. And everything was wiped up including the sauce (using soy sauce, sesame oil and sugar). If you are looking for fresh and good quality seafood even the rare ones like this grouper, look no further ➡️ @mr.fishmongersg
