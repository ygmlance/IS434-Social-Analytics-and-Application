Reverse lunges! Perfect exercise for sculpting and strengthening your legs and hips, it helps build single leg stability as we perform the movement. Especially great for those experiencing knee pain during forward lunges, the reverse method reduces the demand on the knee as it is kept planted on the ground, while still getting the benefits of a lunge!
