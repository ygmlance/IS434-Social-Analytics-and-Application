Chinese ABC soup using pork ribs, carrot, potato, wolf Berry and dried scallop using #PPC .
.
Soup mode for 50 mins at pressure 50.
.
Smell so good when it is releasing the pressure. Soup is thick, taste #sweet and yummy too. The ingredients still keep it original flavour. I brought the pot and boiled over the stove for a few mins after done to let the soup have the #火候 taste.
.
Top up some chilli padi with black sauce to dip the pork ribs. 😋
