Overheard after dinner while A was sketching and Boom milling around
.
A: Wa! I’m so busy, you know
B: Me too, very busy
.
Told them to stop glorifying busyness. If you are busy, you won’t have time to proclaim.  If you claim to be busy too often, no one’s going to believe you
.
Anyway, if people can’t tell if you are busy or not and rely on such declarations, these people aren’t worth their salt to prove anything to
