Ramadan takes on a quiet meaning this year, as COVID-19 restrictions disrupt rituals, celebrations and gatherings.
.
#RamadanÂ is a time of spiritual reflection, self-improvement, and heightened devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam. The fast (sawm) begins at dawn and ends at sunset.
