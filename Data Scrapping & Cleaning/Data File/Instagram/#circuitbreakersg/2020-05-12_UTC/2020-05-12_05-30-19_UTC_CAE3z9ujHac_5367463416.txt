A pram wash is never complete with UV-C sterilisation and an anti-microbial protective coating. ⁠
⁠
Our wash gets rid of dust, dirt, and crumbs with a 165-degree high-pressure steamer do full sterilization that kills microbes, germs and bacteria trapped deep within the fabric. ⁠
⁠
We finish up with a coating of anti-microbial for lasting protection against germs and viruses and UV-C sterilisation to ensure a 100% clean and hygienic baby gear returned to your little one. UV-C light is a short-wavelength that is germicidal, ultraviolet light that breaks apart germ DNA, leaving it unable to function or reproduce. ⁠
⁠
In China, whole buses are being lit up by the ghostly blue light each night in the fight against COVID-19. So, why not your baby's stroller?⁠
