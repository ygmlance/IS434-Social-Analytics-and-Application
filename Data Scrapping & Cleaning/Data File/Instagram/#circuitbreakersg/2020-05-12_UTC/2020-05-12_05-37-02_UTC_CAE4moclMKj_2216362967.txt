An All-Steamed Meal â€¢ is today a lazy day?
.
Introducing the all-steamed family:
+ brown rice with millet
+ drunken chicken
+ xiao bai with mushrooms
+ tofu with garlic and soy sauce
.
.
Thought itâ€™ll be easier if I steam everything, but apparently not.. I have to steam the dishes in batches as my wok canâ€™t fit so many. ðŸ˜ª
