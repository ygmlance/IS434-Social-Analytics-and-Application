Hands up to those of you who has only few strands of lash extensions left? 🙋🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😭 We from pretty Minnie Mouse becoming Mickey Mouse (caught the joke?). 😂 Jokes aside, I know how uncomfortable the dangling last few strand of extensions left feels like, so wanted to share this @lashmagicasia S.O.S. Lash Kit by @lashmagicasia with you ladies!

I actually DIYed lash removal on my own!! So easy I did it the first time while filming the demo. Hehe. Now my lashes feel so light and I can rest them during this CB, using their Lash Protein Serum to strengthen my own lashes.

The S.O.S. Lash Kit is only $38 (includes 10 pcs of Microswab, not the whole bottle ya that I one got separately). But still super worth! Imagine one time to go salon remove is $10, I think w this set you can use many times! Super worth! And don’t need to travel just to get your lashes remover. Swipe ⬅️ to see my demo and also the costs of the products. 👍

Ps. Express delivery for orders is $10, and it is free for orders above $100.
