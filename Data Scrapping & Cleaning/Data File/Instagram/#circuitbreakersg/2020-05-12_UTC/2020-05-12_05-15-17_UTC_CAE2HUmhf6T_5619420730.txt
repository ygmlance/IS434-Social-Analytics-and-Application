Thanks @sciencecentresg for weaving Science so beautifully with Mother's Day celebration 💚♥️💜💙

We absolutely loved this experiment with flowers and food colourings and how the flowers get the colors via transporting through the stems. Kids absolutely loved it and gifted these flowers proudly to Mom.
