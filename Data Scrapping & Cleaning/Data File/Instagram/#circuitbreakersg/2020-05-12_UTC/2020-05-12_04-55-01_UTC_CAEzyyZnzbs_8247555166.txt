Yes still my favourite croissants in Singapore! 🥐
✨
This time I got my top 2 favourites from @petitpain.sg - orange and chocolate escargot (S$3.80) and classic croissant (S$3.00)! Love how light, airy and fluffy the croissants are as usual. Really love the candied orange that they made from scratch and of cos chocolate which’s my ❤️. Also got to say that their standards are very consistent as they taste pretty much the same on all my purchases! 👍🏻
