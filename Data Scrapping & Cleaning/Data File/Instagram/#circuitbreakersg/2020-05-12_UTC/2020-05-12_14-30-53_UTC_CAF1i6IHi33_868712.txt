Check out our very own Circuit Breaker Moms version of the @tiktok #passthebrushchallenge featuring some of the most inspiring women and mothers I know. With Mother’s Day just over, here’s a little something we did together to show our love and support to all the moms who’ve been selflessly putting everyone else before themselves during these trying times in quarantine. Here’s a message to remind you that you are beautiful no matter what, and to always let your best self shine! #cbmomssg
