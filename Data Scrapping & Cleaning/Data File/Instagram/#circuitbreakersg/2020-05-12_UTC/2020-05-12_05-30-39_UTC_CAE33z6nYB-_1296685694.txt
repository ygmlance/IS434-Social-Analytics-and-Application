Hubbyâ€˜s 1st attempt making lasagna and dough from scratch too since he couldnâ€™t find any lasagna pasta after visiting 5 supermarkets! Everywhere is out of stock!!!.
.
Surprisingly his homemade beef lasagna turned out to be so delicious and we enjoyed it so much! ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹.
.
He didnâ€™t follow any recipe at all as everything was made by feel. He only asked me what type of flour to use and what temperature to use when baking. Yes, thatâ€™s all! Since everything was estimated, I canâ€™t replicate it, so sad! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
