Did you know that an average human's attention 
span is shorter than a goldfish? 
A goldish has an attention span of 9 seconds.
In 2015 an average humans attention span is 8.25 seconds. 
This is due to us humans being constantly bombarded by text 
messages, emails and social media notifications.
As years goes by we crave for new information to entertain ourselves.
Its getting more and more diffcult to pay attention to anything. 
Marketers around the world are trying daily to sell to a goldfish!
