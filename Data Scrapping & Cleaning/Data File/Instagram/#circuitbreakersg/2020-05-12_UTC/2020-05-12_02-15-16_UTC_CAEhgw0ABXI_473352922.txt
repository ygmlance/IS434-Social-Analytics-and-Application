Breakfast is often described as the most important meal of the day and I believe to start off with a pretty breakfast will actually brighten up my day! Don’t you think so? During this Circuit Breaker Period, it’s perfect time to brush up my home-cooking, explore new Breakfast Recipe Ideas.

To avoid running out of the ingredients that I use most frequently, I often order the Dairy, Chilled & Eggs via @foodpandasg Pandamart, check out using @dbsbank DBS PayLah! and I got it delivered to my doorstep within 30 to 40mins.

From placing the order to making payment via DBS PayLah!, everything is so just simple #JustPayLah #DBSPayLah

P.S:  New customers will receive S$5 off S$10 spend with code 'PLNEW' when they pay with PayLah!
