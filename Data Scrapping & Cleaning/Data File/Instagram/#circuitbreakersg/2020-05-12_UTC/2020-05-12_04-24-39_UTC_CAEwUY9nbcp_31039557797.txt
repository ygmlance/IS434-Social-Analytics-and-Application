â–  Water is Life... literally. 
At least 50% of our body is made up of water. Water makes up more than half of our blood, and over 70% of our muscles! Hence, at the most basic level, water is key to our survival and existence.

Being well hydrated will enable you to sustain performance for longer, and also aid in recovery. .
