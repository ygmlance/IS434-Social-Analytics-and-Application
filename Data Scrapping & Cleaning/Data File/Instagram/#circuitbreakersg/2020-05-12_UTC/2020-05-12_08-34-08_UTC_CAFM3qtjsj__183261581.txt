#circuitbreakersg day 36

About 30 of us were supposed to fly to Ipoh/Penang this morning for a short break but cos of Covid and movement control, our trip was naturally aborted😢
For now we cant even stroll the  Ipoh Lane or the Penang Road of Singapore🥺so #stayhomeindulge! 😂
#stayhomestaysafe#sgunited🇸🇬😷💪🏻❤️
