Hello! Learned something new today and here’s a mini photog tutorial to share 🤓

I’ve always wondered how people post a seamless looking carousel post on IG, looking like a smooth pano shot. Swipe to see before 👉🏼 .
1️⃣If you have multiple shots like me, merge the pictures using Photomerge on PS
2️⃣With the pano image, crop to ratio 12:5
3️⃣Under View, select New Guide Layout and enter number of images you want to split to under Columns. I entered 2 to get 2 split images. 
4️⃣Right click crop tool to select Slice Tool > Slices from guide
5️⃣Export your images and you’re done! .
🔖 Let me know if this is useful!
