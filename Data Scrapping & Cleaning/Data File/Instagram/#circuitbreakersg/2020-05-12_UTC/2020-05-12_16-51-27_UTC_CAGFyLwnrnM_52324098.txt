A quick stir fry pasta that’s tasty and delicious.
.
A light marinate is all you need if you get a good cut of meat. For this dish I marinated my strips of Black Angus Ribeye with a generous dose of #slapyourmama White Pepper Spices.
.
In a heated pan, add oil, slice Garlic and Leek. Fry for 2 mins.
.
Add in the marinated beef & fry for 2 mins
.
Add frozen peas (quantity to your preference) & chopped Coriander stems. Fry another 2 mins
.
Add cooked spaghetti, and toss through ingredients well. Taste and adjust ground Himalayan Pink Salt and Pepper.
.
Before serving, add in an additional 1/2 cup of chopped Coriander leaves (optional). You can also add a beef cube if you prefer. Dish and serve.
