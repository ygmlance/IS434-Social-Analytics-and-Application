12 May 20 [#CircuitBreakerSG Day 36] :: We’ve been listening to many new songs this period. Singing in the toilet, dancing on the bed and playing the drums to the new music we found. Today, #bigbro文 drummed to “Cake By The Ocean” by @kidzbop and I LOVE IT [I recommend you search on YouTube ‘cake by the ocean by kidz bop’ and let your kids PE to it as part of holiday program] Daddy was grooving in the living room and he came into the room and told Ewan, “Such a good job! I enjoyed it so much from the outside.”
.
When Circuit Breaker kicked in, I was wondering how music lessons will be conducted because don’t we need our teachers next to us to point us to the right notes and beats? But it has proven otherwise! I’ve seen Ewan improve week by week through Zoom lessons and online materials his drum school uploaded for our usage. Glad it did work out thanks to his teacher @waiyousofunny! There’s even a Virtual Recital coming up organised by #MyDrumSchool. Cool beans!

Sign up for a free online trial class at @mydrumschool this May school holiday to pique your kids’ interest. Actually, if yourself or your dad/mom wants to give this free trial a shot, they can too! No age limit.

Do you really need a drum set to attend an online class? Not really because a make-shift drum kit using a practice pad, books and a stack of paper will work too. Oh wait! How about drum sticks? Consider chopsticks or spatulas for the time-being! .

Music Makes The Soul Happy! Continue grooving through #StayHomeSG guys. Music lifts depression, spirits and cabin fever! .
