Air fried MaNuggets, barbecue sauce, and buttered corn.
.
I had bought a pack of frozen nuggets which I heard to be similar to McDonaldâ€™s for bubs, thinking that I could pamper her a little when macs is closed.
Who knew they would open their doors again so soon, and my fast food chain at home was gonna go out of business?ðŸ¤£
.
Pork chop with garlic sunny side and homemade sauerkraut.(Schweinkbraten)
.
Needed to make use of my pork leg stash, and the egg is to balance out the saltiness.
