Basic Butter Cookies. huge cookie and biscuit lover here and it is really hard to find basic butter cookies without any artifical ingredients, or they always end up either too sweet or half butter half margarine. Margarine is a big nono as much as we can for my family. So snack and only the good stuff goes in. Baked cookies post coming up next! Modified from jmeteo recipe because I'm lacking 1 ingredient ðŸ™‚
