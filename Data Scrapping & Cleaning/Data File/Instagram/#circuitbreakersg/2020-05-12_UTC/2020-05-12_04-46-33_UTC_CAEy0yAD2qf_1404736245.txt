'I wear my mask already', said the 2yo #Spidey.  But a rules's a rule, no matter who you are - said his Mommy! Just so you know - in a parallel Superhero-crazy-universe, mask-up has an entirely different meaning. You can't attend to pressing matters without dressing-up to stand out...duhh (go big, or go home!)! So, to make stepping out a tad easier on specially rough days 🙄, we let him double mask-up (see all pics), complete with any other prop needed by him to 'save the day'. AND we sanitise them when we get home 😅, because with great power, comes great responsibility 😬❤. #Ruhanster #superhero #masks #maskup #staysafe #lockdown #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
