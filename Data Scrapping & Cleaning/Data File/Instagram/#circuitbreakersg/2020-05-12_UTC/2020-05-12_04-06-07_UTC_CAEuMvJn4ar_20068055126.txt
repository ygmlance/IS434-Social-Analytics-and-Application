They might look like just another batch of ordinary chicken but in fact they are anything but ordinary. Our delicious Belacan Chicken Boneless Leg with sautÃ©ed kalian, king oyster mushroom, sambal egg are a lot mellower and "sweeter" after a light grilling. Crispy on the outside but tender and juicy inside!
