I have been supporting the work of @insidethetinkerbox for a while now with their handmade, #upcycled reusable products and when I found out she was making face masks, I knew I had to get it la!

Finally. A reusable face mask ðŸ˜· made to our specifications.

This mask can be resized accordingly and it can also fit in an extra surgical face mask or even a tissue (if we really need to) and the ear ties (which are subject to wear & tear obviously) are easily replaceable with our own old clothes material later on.

This is what I love about her work. Itâ€™s these little attention to details that make it worth every penny spent. 
Do support her work if you guys are on a lookout for reusable face mask as we slowly resume to our lives with new norms (like face masks). Thank you for these masks #insidethetinkerbox!
