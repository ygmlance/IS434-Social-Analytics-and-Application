Following @robcheney1 & @golftecsg YouTube video on Putting Series - Start Line Drill and decided to DIY the missing components for the drill. 
Totally regretting not getting the @puttoutgolf unit and mat when I was in the US last September and even when I was in KL last December when @mstgolf had the #puttout offer of the unit, mat, mirror and gate. Now with the #circuitbreakersg in place. It is even harder to get my hands on the puttout set. 
So it is @inesis_golf practice balls to the rescue. 
Two bottles of beer courtesy of #unyangkordaisg and @carinasuyin as the putting gate and a bit of #tlar since I'm too lazy to find a ruler to measure 55mm and 14in. 
No laser so I'm using the grouting between the tiles as my line. I'm putting just a bit left of the line though. Just using the line as a guide. 
The Wii Fit board at the back to catch my balls or ensure that I at least make contact with the board to make sure that I don't leave my putts short. 
Blu Tack still on my putter from Rob's last putting lesson on centred contact.
