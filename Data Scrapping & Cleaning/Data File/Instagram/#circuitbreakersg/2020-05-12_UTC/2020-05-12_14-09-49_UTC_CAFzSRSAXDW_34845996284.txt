Miso Salmon fried rice
📝I like to steam salmon fillet up and make it into flakes. This salmon flakes can be kept for few days for a good variety of meals
📝always use cooked rice kept in fridge for fried rice. It is easy to fry and texture is nice
📝I add miso for flavoring instead of purely salt and soya sauce and it turned out well
📝Pre-mix 2 teaspoon of miso, 2 tablespoon of soya sauce, 50ml water or salmon juices from the steam

Ingredients: salmon fillet from @9sseafood, onion, shredded carrot, 2 eggs, miso, spring onion, cooked rice kept in fridge

❶ Marinate salmon with salt, pepper and herbs for 30 minutes. Steam for 20 minutes. Make it into flakes. I will keep the juices for fried rice.
❷ Make scramble eggs and keep for use later.
❸ Heat up oil and fry onion until slightly transparent
❹ Add shredded carrot and mix well. Shredded carrot cooked easily so don’t need to spend much time on it
❺ Add salmon flakes, add pre-mix miso with soya sauce and mix well
❻ Add back scrambled egg and rice from fridge and mix. Stir fry for about 10 minutes
❼ Ready to serve with thinly sliced spring onion and sunny side up egg
