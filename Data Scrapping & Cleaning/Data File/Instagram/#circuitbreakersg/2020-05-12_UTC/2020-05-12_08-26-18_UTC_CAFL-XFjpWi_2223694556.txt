Received this msg from friend after she attended my business opportunity online webinar 🤭⁣
⁣
Yes.  Frankly speaking, myself also don’t like MLM Business Model when I start business 😊⁣
⁣
When I have the thinking want start up business. Eventually realise that I have 3️⃣ issues / challenges ⁣
👉🏻 I don’t have strong & enough 𝐂𝐀𝐏𝐈𝐓𝐀𝐋 ⁣
👉🏻 I don’t have a good quality & competitive 𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐃𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐒 ⁣
👉🏻 I don’t have mentor who can 𝐂𝐎𝐀𝐂𝐇 how to run a successful business ⁣
⁣
So , MLM / Network Marketing is ONLY platform I can embark 📲⁣
✅ Low Capital & 𝐙𝐄𝐑𝐎 risk platform ⁣
✅ Collaborate with 𝐈𝐍𝐍𝐎𝐕𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐕𝐄 𝐏𝐀𝐓𝐄𝐍𝐓 products ⁣
✅ Learn from leader who already success in this business ⁣
⁣
About my friends comment, there is nothing wrong. Every Industry sure have small portion of black sheep who do the wrong things in wrong way. As long as , I do it correct & professional. 😉⁣
