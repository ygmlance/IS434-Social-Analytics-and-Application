As part of my Mother’s Day celebrations, JW gave me his card @awfullychocolatesg . Not sure if it’s cuz of #circuitbreakersg , I really need chocolate. And I went on a spending spree of sorts. I bought an 8 inch chocolate cake (and probably ate half myself), bought an iced chocolate banana (which was so rich and good) and this salted caramel brownie. Jw adored it and say it’s his fave out of the lot. Perfectly blended salty and sweet in every bite. The brownie wasn’t too sticky or too crispy, but had a nice glazed too. #brownie #foodporn #mothersday #supper #chocolate #stayhomeeatcake
