So hungreeee tonight after my brain cells got depleted from endless calls that I thought of cooking #notfake Mac nâ€™ Cheese - conchiglione cooked in Organic Soy Milk and Sharp Red Cheddar, a little sprinkle of Himalayan Salt and Dried Parsley. It is soooo good that I licked the bowl of the excess sauce!!! ðŸ˜‚ #macncheese #notfakemacncheese #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
