Wafu Mentaiko Aglio Olio
--------------------------------------------
This photo displeases me for two reasons. I really wanted to make a full on wafu pasta, but I forgot to buy cream and didn't have enough mentaiko. In comes the aglio olio idea. Second, the placement of the seaweed clumping together annoyed me. I said two reasons, now there's a third. I wish I had the time to cook like I did on the weekend I made this dish, just before work. Covid-19 has been tiring for healthcare workers. Its just my third week at work, and I've clocked almost 24 hours in 2 days. Hoping I still have time to cook on weekends now ðŸ˜­
