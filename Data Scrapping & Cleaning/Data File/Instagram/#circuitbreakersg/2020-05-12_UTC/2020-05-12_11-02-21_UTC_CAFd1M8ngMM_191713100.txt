🕞 Hong Kong Egg Tarts

Today’s bake, Classic Hong Kong tarts. I have been craving for these for awhile,so finally baked them today.
What is better than fresh out from the oven, biting into these crispy crust and warm egg custard.

The shape of the crusts are still not quite there yet, but the taste is definitely on point👌🏻
i just couldn’t help myself from spamming all the pictures of these yummy tarts.😂
