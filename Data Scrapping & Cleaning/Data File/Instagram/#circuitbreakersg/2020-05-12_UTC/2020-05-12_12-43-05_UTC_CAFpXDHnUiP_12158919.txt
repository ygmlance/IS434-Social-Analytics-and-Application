I am privileged to have access to clean living spaces and areas to continue keeping up with my fitness. But not everyone is this privileged. And I hope you can continue reading this post.

Most of us should have received the $600 Solidarity Budget Payout. Would you mind contributing $25 (which is equivalent to ~4% of the one-off cash support) to the vulnerable community?

I’m uniting with other Singaporeans and homegrown companies for #SGPAYSITFORWARD which will provide sanitisation care packs for recipients in need. This is a National movement put together by individuals, local companies and organisations to give back to vulnerable communities during COVID-19.

How it works?
•Every $25 contributed, a care pack containing essential sanitation products will be given to vulnerable communities in need.
•Contributions go towards funding the provision, no profiteering (items are taken at or below cost price).
•It is quick and hassle free to contribute

You can visit www.sgpaysitforward.com and purchase a pack to support the vulnerable during COVID-19. I’ve contributed 1 care pack and I’m forwarding this movement to @anrene @thejohnyeong and all of you to contribute if you can 🙏🏼 Thanks for reading till the end, you have a kind heart. ❤️
