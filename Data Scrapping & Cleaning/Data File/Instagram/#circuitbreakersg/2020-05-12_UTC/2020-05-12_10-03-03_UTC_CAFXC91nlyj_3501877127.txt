Two more hours to Kelly, Lightworker's first charity fundraiser of 2020! I'm offering quick Tarot readings on Facebook Live. All proceeds go to Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), an organisation that cares for migrant workers in Singapore. 💗

You're welcome to join me (and maybe my cats if they decide to kaypoh - they ALWAYS do) on Facebook Live tonight, 12 May at 8-10 pm (SGT: GMT+8)! To get a reading, click on link in my bio now! Thank you for your support. 💗🙏 https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/kelly-x-twc2-a-covid-19-fundraiser-for-migrant-workers-in-sg-tickets-104106212484
