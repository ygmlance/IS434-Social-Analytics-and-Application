In #RME lessons this week, our children learned more about the life of our Founder, St John Baptist de La Salle and the #virtues he showed in setting up schools. Some chose to write about his life pointing out the humble sacrifice and resilience he showed in the face of many challenges during the founding years of the first #Lasallian schools. 
Other students also wrote beautiful messages of solidarity with other children all over the world, reminding us of God’s presence even in today’s crisis. 💚🤗 Let us remember these words from our Founder: “You can do more with the help of God’s grace than you can imagine.” #SJII #homelearning #elementaryschool #circuitbreakersg
