Tonight we had #italianfood delivered from @latteriamozzarellabar on #duxtonhill. For appetizers we had their Fior di latte (cow milk mozzarella with smoked salmon and salmon roe) and bruschetta; for mains we had  pork chop milanese and grilled sirloin (Tagliata di Manzo). The dishes were absolutely sumptuous, plus we definitely had our fill of mozzarella, arugula and cherry tomatoes! Skipped on the pasta to reduce the carb load, though the menu looked absolutely tempting ðŸ˜† Ordered via @deliveroo_sg.
