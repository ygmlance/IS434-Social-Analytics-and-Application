I mentioned in our last post that there was another crab dish on the agenda for #mothersday. I decided to make my mum all the things she was craving over the weekend; one of them was Chilli Crab.

I ordered these lovely live Indonesian Mud Crabs a couple of days in advance from @ahhuakelong, so you can imagine how fresh they were. It was my first time slaughtering and cleaning a mud crab myself so I did research on best/responsible practices on @spcasingapore’s website. Fingers crossed I did right by Carl & Chris Crabster.

These crabs were simmered in a homemade rempah of dried & fresh chilies, chili padi, shallots, garlic , lengkuas (galanggal), serei (lemongrass) and buah keras (candle nut). .
.
The rempah gets fried with toasted belacan, seasoned with sugar, salt, taucheow (fermented soya beans) and a liberal amount of good quality tomato ketchup. This evolves into a thin sauce once the crabs get a chance to cook in it. Eggs are added at the tail end for richness - they also act as a natural thickening agent that turns that thin sauce into that sweet and savory gravy we all know and love (perfect for dredging mantou buns in).

Suffice to say, the moms was very pleased. I even managed to send over bentos with a little taster for @vivinstagram and @nikvoon. I’m definitely looking forward to my next order from @ahhuakelong.
