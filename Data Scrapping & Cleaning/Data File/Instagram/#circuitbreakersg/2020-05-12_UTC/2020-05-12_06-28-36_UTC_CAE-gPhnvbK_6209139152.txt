About last week: From a Mother’s Day local project with Salvatore Ferragamo to copious amounts of Mrs Manini’s bespoke Negroni and Limoncello tea, to photos of takeaways shared by our clients.... Last week was a very good week indeed. ❤️🙏 Thank you for tagging us/ sharing! Wish we could upload more than just 10 images for each post! 
We’re open again today, from 5pm for another week of #circuitbreakersg #maninitakeaways. 
Thank you for the love ❤️🙏❤️
Stay safe. Stay Sane. Stay home. 💪🏻
