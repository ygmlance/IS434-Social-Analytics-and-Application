I’m just gonna call this Big Breakfast. Made this for brunch today. Good news is that I managed to clear everything in the fridge last week for the second time.

Went to the supermarket yesterday while everyone is hyping over McD’s reopening and managed to snag some nice produce.

Today is 12 May, which means y’all can now go have a hair cut! But please, remember to stay safe; wear a mask, wash or sanitise your hands, and remember to keep a safe distance.
