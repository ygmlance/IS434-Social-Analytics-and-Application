Yay took a little break from baking and went to get some 🍰 and 🍩 on the first day of the easing of CB restrictions!
✨
Got the fluffy cream rolls in original and matcha, and soufflé cheesecake from @chateraise.singapore, plus a chocolate Oreo doughnut from @krispykremesingapore! 🥛🍵🧀🍪
✨
Love the cakes from @chateraise.singapore as usual, especially the soufflé cheesecake which’s so light. It’s a little sweet but still acceptable to me. The chocolate Oreo doughnut is much sweeter, but I love the dough of their doughnuts, so soft and fluffy! ☁️

Did you all get anything that you have been wanting to today? No matter what, remember to keep your social distancing! 😷
