<Giveaway> My little girl and I love to do colouring and it's one activity we do regularly. During this #circuitbreakersg we have been colouring more often than we used to. There are so many benefits to something so simple such as hand eye coordination, skill of patience, learning to focus, #creativity and my fav of all is we get to bond in a quiet setting and enjoying the quality time together.
.
These mats from @colourmemats are beautifully designed from scratch and each one tells a story which parents can guide them through each character. How thoughtful! Comes in regular and mini sized! The mini ones comes in a set of 4 and works as a puzzle when u put them together üòç Easy to take it with u anywhere u go too!
