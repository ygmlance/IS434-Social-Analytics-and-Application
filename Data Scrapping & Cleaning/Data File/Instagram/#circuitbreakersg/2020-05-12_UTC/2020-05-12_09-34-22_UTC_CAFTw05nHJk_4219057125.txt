I am a huge fan of karipap or epok epok! I can't resist buying them to try whenever I see them. There is so much pleasure in biting into a crispy, thin, hot shell with a fragrant curry filling inside. Mmmmm... So I got tempted to recreate this at home. However, I was not able to deep fry this so I baked it. Fried a curry potato chicken filling to go with it. Its not as fragrant as a deep fried one but seriously, the shell is still thin and yields easily on the bite without shattering into crumbs. (and less calories!) I am satisfied.
