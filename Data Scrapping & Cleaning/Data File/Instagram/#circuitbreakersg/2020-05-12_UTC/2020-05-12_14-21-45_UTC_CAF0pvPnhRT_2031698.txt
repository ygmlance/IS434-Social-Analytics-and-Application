Day 36 circuit breaker thoughts:

I am grateful for being alive, for being well.
I am grateful for being safe, for my health,
and for all the inumberable blessings in my life.
I am grateful I get to start all over again everyday.
Don't be afraid, you may like your new story better.

The dream will manifest. 
The worry will subside. 
The right people will appear. 
The results you wanted will happen. 
The love will grow. 
The Universe will bless you.
