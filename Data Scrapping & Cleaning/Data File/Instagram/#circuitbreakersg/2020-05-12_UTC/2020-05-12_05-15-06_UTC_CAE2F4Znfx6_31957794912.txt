Only posting this to be part of the #stayhomewithascott campaign. @capitaland Hope Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Ascott, will donate US$10 for every pledge with the aforementioned hashtag from now to 31 May. The donation will go towards Save the Children’s global food security & assistance programs by supporting about 12k underprivileged children affected by the pandemic globally. For every pledge, it’ll go towards providing food for a child over 20 days. #doanythingforchildren #savethechildren .

Fruits of my labour (literally when my hand still hurts) last weekend for Mother’s Day. Granted my mum’s wish n satiated my parents’ craving for steamed radish cake and cheesecake. Attempted a Basque Burnt cheesecake here this time. 
I cut a wee bit slice of the radish cake for myself, let it sit in the fridge n tada whipped up a quick lunch today by frying this with eggs n some sambal. Another one of our quintessential hawker eats - Chye tao kuey otherwise known as fried carrot cake. By the way, there r no carrots in this dish at all which is ironic by the name of it (ikr!) But radish is also known as white carrot so I guess that’s how it is. 🤷‍♀️ . 
Making radish cake is not difficult but just a very onerous process like the yam cake. But it’s all worthwhile. 😋
