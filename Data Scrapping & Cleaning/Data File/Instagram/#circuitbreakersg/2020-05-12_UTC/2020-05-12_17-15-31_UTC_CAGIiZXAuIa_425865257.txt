The #quarantinekitchen noodle game is still going strong. Xi’an-style, obviously. And so, stone-baked a Nangbing 馕饼 (Uyghur flatbread) to go with it. Sprinkled with white & black sesame seeds. .
.
Xi’an spicy lamb noodles: minced lamb dressed @laoganmausa chilli oil, rice wine, corn flour water, black vinegar, black sesame oil, cumin & coriander seeds, Szechuan pepper, garlic and ginger. Tossed with lamian; anointed with guajilo chilli, coriander leaves and scallion.
