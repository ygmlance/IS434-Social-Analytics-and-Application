Today, I am MAT WITH LOVE ðŸ’œ
First a special home-made lunch delivery of fried vermicelli with chunky bits of pork chop, pan-fried omelette, juicy shitake mushrooms and crispy fried anchovies plus #eatyourvegetables of the nai-bai variety. Accompanied by two lovingly curated bottles of negroni with their very own garnish.
AND THEN THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE : a new yoga mat so I can continue to roll with it!!!
Yes. This definitely deserves a square.
