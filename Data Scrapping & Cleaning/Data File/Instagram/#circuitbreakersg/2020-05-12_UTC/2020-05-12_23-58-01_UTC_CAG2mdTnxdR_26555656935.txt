I decided to upend the tradition of celebrating myself as Mama
this Mother's Day. Here's why...
〰️
I can't blame it on #covid19 nor #quarentinelife nor #circuitbreakersg. Actually, I have to thank the #coronavírus for inducing this bout of crazy creativity in thinking up this new tradition for our #anythingfamilee.

SO instead of celebrating ME the MAMA on Mother's Day, I decided I should really be celebrating the precious ones who were given to me to make me Mama. I have been rather a 🧟‍♀️M.A.d MOMster - shrieking, screaming, scolding, nagging and flying into too many bouts of mama tantrums these months. And I guess, this is my way of telling my kids, 'THANK YOU for always still choosing to call me Mama, extending me your unconditional ♥ and forgiveness when I fail to act maturely as Mama.'
〰️
And since I didnt have a 'good' actual Mother's Day celebration on Sunday (read: had to do the usual chores of cleaning, cooking and dealing with, yes, kids doing their regular kid things - cos human nature doesn't take a break from sibling fights, ykwim?), I decided on some vicarious travel ✈ early Monday morning to a different 🌍 time zone and have a DO-OVER of my own Mother's Day Celebrations. (Yah! A bit of a cheaterbug here but... Hey! Always better to have a chance for a do-over than not, right?) 〰️
🎂 I BAKED US a cake. I tried out a NEW cake recipe and a NEW method of making cake by steaming. Woohoo for me!
🕤 Waited patiently for the kids to wake.  But as you can see, one of my little one couldn't wait! She stole many many licks! And yet another was still in bed by the time Little Miss threatened to Hulk-smash through the cake.
🥰 I was so, so, so happy to see how my 3 little gems really enjoyed the cake I made.
〰️
I am not a perfect Mama but I thank God He is a perfect Papa. He is more than enough for us and my kids! 
As I learn to abide in my Heavenly Father, I can trust that He will help me be the best Mama to them.
