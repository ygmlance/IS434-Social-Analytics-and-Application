#circuitbreakersg day 36

Made a simple rice bowl of smoked duck, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and pea sprouts for a quick and fuss free dinner tonight. 🍅 🥒 🌱

How’s everyone doing today? 🙂

I’m starting to really appreciate working from home. Being able to wake up just shortly before work starts, being in the comfort and safety of my own home, and I was even able to take a power nap over lunch time today. ✌🏼

So I’m grateful for this comfort today. We may not realize it now but I’m sure some of us will miss being able to work from home after work from office resumes. #gratitudediary
