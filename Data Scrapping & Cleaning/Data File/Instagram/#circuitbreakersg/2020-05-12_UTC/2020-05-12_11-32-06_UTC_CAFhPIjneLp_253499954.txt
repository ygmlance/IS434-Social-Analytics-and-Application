I was surprised when I ordered @hongkeevillaclementi’s Satay Bee Hoon. It didn’t felt oily and it was very tasty. The thickness of the satay sauce was pretty on point and the bee hoon came in harmony with the sauce.

One good thing here is that the accompaniments were cooked to order, such as the cuttlefish cooked right without feeling rubbery, prawns and meat and clams were fresh and delectable.

Of course, another one I enjoyed was their customisation when I could order char siew here with a good hint of sauce followed by a braised egg. The char siew was nicely done with the I was also told that this is also available for bulk orders too. Highly recommended!
