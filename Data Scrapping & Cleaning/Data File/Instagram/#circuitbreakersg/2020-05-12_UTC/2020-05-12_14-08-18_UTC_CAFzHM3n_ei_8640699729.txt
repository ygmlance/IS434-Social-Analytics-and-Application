Yay! A little embarrassed to say, I've been trying free Coursera courses for years now and I finally to finish one 8 week course today! 😊🙏
. 
I've tried courses from "Mozart Composition" years ago to "Greening the economy" early this year. I'm surprised by the extensive information to learn, the perseverance and time needed, and the final exam (😂) in order to complete one! .
Yay! Very proud of myself and hoping to use these knowledge (also covers human and animal revolution) to help more dogs. 😌
