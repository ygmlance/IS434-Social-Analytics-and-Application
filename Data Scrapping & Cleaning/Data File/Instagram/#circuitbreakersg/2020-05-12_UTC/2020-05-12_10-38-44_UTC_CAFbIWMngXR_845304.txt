Was expecting to queue for an eternity so was armed with battery pack, earphones etc.

Thankfully there were only 7 people in front of me when I joined the queue.

After a few mins, I turned back and saw 12 people behind me. Welps.

Hope they brought their battery pack, earphones etc.

Also got my KopiC, dapaoed Chendol, and strangely enjoyed a little tan (at least on the arms and whatever unmasked area above the nose). Thanks to the crazy scorching CB sun.
