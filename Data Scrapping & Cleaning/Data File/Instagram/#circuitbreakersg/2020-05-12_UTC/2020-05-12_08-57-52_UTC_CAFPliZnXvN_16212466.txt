Took my precious soy sauce braising stock out from the freezer to prepare a 'no sweat' meal. Just 10-15 mins of braising and that's it. After braising the chicken, it went back to the freezer and will not see the light of day until the next mission.ðŸ˜‚ I also made Spring Onion Ginger Oily Sauce for the chicken and noodles. It really adds a lot of flavours to the dish. Yum! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
