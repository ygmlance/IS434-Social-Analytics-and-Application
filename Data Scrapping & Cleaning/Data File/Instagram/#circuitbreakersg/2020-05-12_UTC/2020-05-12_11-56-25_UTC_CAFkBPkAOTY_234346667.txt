【Recipe】Chicken potato pot pie. A break away from the usual Asian dishes I have been whipping up for the past days (or weeks🤔) #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
Simple comfort food, and pretty much can be changed to your preference. Like using minced pork/beef/salmon instead, mash potatoes, not sliced, or even go vegetarian if you like that.
I opted for a mix of sweet potatoes and potatoes for the topping because I like the sweet and savoury contrast. Plus the colour contrast is nicer too☺️. Cheesy crust also adds more flavour and texture to the final dish. 
Catch me cooking this in my IGS. Sharing the recipe here. #honeybeecookschickenpotatopotpie
