M A Y 2020
.
In just a short two weeks, weâ€™ve already had two zoom sessions and weâ€™re revving to do more.
.
In this circuit breaker period, we do realise many are going through difficulties we may or may not relate to each other, resulting in some pent up feelings we might all have.
.
Doing these sessions are great to help us keep engaged and have some Creative fun.
.
We will definitely be looking forward to more sessions coming up ðŸ™‚
