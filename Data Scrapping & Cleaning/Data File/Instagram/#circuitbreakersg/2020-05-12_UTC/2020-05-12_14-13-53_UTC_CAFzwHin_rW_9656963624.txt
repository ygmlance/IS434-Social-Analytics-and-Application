We are thankful for the many responses that we received through instastories in response to our questions from yesterday’s post. (We would still love to hear from you if you have yet to respond, head to our stories!). We have also taken time to respond to each and every of the responses from yesterday. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
One thing that stood out for me was that we find it hard for our children to articulate their inner thoughts and feelings, and the older they get, the more wary they seem when we try to dig deep in our conversations with them.

Is this the same for you? Let us know.
