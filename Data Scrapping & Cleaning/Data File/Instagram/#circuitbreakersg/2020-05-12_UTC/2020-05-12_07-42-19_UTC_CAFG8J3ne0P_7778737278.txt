#circuitbreakersg These 3 servings of Crispy Chicken with Cheesy Baked Rice made my family very happy for dinner. I've been craving this so it's a reward for myself too. 🍗🧀🍚🥦🥕🍄🥄 It was abit of extra work to pan-fry the chicken first and fry the rice with garlic for extra flavour, however it's really worth the effort if you're in the mood to suffer cleaning up the kitchen. Maybe next time, I'll just use Airfried Salmon or Baked Chicken. 
Once the rice is done and mixed with the carrots, broccoli and mushroom (or whatever veggies you fancy), you can start layering the top. I used a layers of pasta sauce and cheese on the rice, then arranged the chicken and added another layer on top.

Pop it in the pre-heated oven at 180°C for about 12-15mins and it's done when you see the cheese melted nicely. Must keep an eye on it coz burnt cheese will ruin the whole dish. Try it!
