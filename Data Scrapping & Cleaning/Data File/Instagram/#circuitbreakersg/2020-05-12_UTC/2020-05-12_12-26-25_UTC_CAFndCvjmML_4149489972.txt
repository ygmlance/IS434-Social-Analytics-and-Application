I know it doesn’t look like it here but I’ve honestly lost quite a bit of flexibility since I stopped doing yoga... in 2017? I can’t remember when anymore. But yes it’s true, all it takes is a little bit of daily effort. I’m finally comfortable with left splits again. Aaand now to work on the other side! .
