A simple set up to teach 👧🏻👦🏻🧒🏻 how rain is formed.
🧪a clear container
🧪 a strainer to be placed on top of the above container
🧪 cotton wool as “clouds”
🧪 water with blue colouring to make rain
🧪dropper/spoon
•
👧🏻👦🏻🧒🏻 to drip water onto the “clouds” until they get so heavy and fall as rain. Droppers for 👧🏻👦🏻, spoon for 🧒🏻. While doing the experiment, dunno why 👦🏻 kept asking if he could drink the water 🤦🏻‍♀️ And i think 🧒🏻 did a good job in the scooping, what do you think? 😄

We talked about 小水滴组成了云。当云大到空气托不住的时候，就会落下来，形成了雨。
