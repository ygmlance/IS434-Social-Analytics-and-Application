Let's have a moment of silence for San Diego Comic-Con as it is cancelled for the first time in 50 years. Ok, now that that's done, geeks and nerds fret not as  SDCC organisers decided to have an at home version of the event!! Get your costumes on, video call your friends as Comic-Con is still happening!
