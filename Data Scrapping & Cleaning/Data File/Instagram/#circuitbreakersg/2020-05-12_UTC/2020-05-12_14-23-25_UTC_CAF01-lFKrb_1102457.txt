#CircuitBreakerSg Day 36! Budae jjigae aka army stew for tonightâ€™s dinner! Itâ€™s been awhile since I last made one and also first time serving it in my pink #brunohotplate! Todayâ€™s soup base was our homemade collagen stock. So yummy even I skip the cheese and baked beans. We enjoyed it so much. ðŸ˜‹ Get recipe at #wenarmystew if you are interested.

With a good stock and right concocted paste, all you need is 5 groups of main ingredients to make a delicious pot of army stew:
1. Processed meat - spam/luncheon meat and sausages
2. Fresh meat/seafood - shabu pork/beef, chicken or fish meat, oysters, clams 
3. Vegetables - kimchi, leek, zucchini, long cabbage, spring onion, sliced chillies 
4. Any type of tofu and mushrooms
5. Carbs - ramen, tteobokki or sweet potato noodle, macaroni
**Optional - baked beans and cheese**
