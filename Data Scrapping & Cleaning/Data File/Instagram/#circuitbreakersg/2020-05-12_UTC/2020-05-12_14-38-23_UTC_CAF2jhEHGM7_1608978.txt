“Hello everypawdy! How’s your circuit breaker coming along? Well, mine’s pretty good. If you’ve been following my stories today you’d see that I’m mainly eating and sleeping! I still get to go for walks, except that now I can only gai-gai in my neighbourhood. Today I visited the vet to get my meds, and escaped taking a blood test phew! Making an appearance on your timeline because I haven’t been here in a while! My hooman just can’t get over my 萌 face in this picture! Anyway, hope all of ya are keeping well, and please #stayhomeforSG ! See you all soon!” #circuitbreakersg #luckylee #luckytheschnauzer #schnauzersofinstagram🐾 #dogsofinstagram #sgdogs
