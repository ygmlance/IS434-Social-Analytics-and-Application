My Pandesal Workflow 😁 First time for me to make pandesal.I was so worried coz  the dough is too soft, i even message my friends to ask opinion. I followed #panlasangpinoy like a walkthrough in my #diablo3 game, but my dough is too far from his youtube video.
after 1 hour of waiting, the dough started to rise! and the rest is history. Tomorrow i'll put cheese inside the dough before baking, might also try putting corned beef and spam 😁 #bakingbread #circuitbreakersg #effectofcovid19 #stayathomeandbake
