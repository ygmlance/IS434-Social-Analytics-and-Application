As we expectantly await the reopening of our favourite bubble tea stalls, these food places selling BBT drinks could be our new go-to this Circuit Breaker. In collaboration with Kamâ€™s Roast, Joy Luck Teahouse is selling their Hong Kong-style Pearl of The Orient ($4.80) bubble milk tea together with a purchase of any main dish. You can top up $1 for an add-on of marine collagen into your cup of BBT!

Shihlin Taiwanese Snacks has rolled out three new boba drinks: Brown Sugar Fresh Milk Boba ($4.70), Honey Fresh Green Tea ($3.70), and 1983 Boba Milk Tea ($4.20). Cop a free cup for any order above $35!

Route 65 is selling burger and bubble tea sets starting from $9.90+. Each of their juicy burgers comes with a complimentary Route 65 Specialty Milk Tea. Top-up $1 to try other BBT flavours, including the classic Oolong Milk Tea or Taro Milk Tea.
