ARTIST PROFILE - SHAK'THIYA 
2 TRUTHS 1 LIE 
React to vote which statement you think is the lie! üò¢ - I have a talent for always finding myself next to a dustbin at a gathering/party üòÆ - I can tell the circumference of anyone's head from first glance ‚ù§Ô∏è - My musical "career" is the result of a series of accidents

The first few times Shak performed on stage it wasn't as a musician but as a Spoken Word Poet! Then one day he put his poetry to music and has captivated audiences ever since. 
There is a magic about Shak you can only experience watching him perform. An honesty so strong and a fireceness that wont let you look away as he belts out a mix of Folk, Blues, Soul and Hip-Hop.

Shak has performed everywhere, from the largest National Stage (the National Day Parade itself) to bedroom sessions with close friends and the countless bars and pubs in between.

Come for poetry, Stay for Shak
