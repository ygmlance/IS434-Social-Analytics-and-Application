Last Friday on #circuitbreakersg day32 - when there’s a knocking on your door & you know you haven’t ordered anything online; an unexpected delivery from a thoughtful friend. Plus it came with one of my favourite quotes :  Life is not about waiting for the storms to pass. It’s about learning how to dance in the rain ~~ Vivian Green ~~
