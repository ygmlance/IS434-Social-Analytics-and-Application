Cha gio (Vietnamese spring rolls) with nuoc cham. These crispy, savoury rolls are filled with minced pork, wood ear mushrooms, carrots and cabbage, rolled in rice paper, and deep fried. They're so crunchy and perfect!!⁣ Even better wrapped in a crisp lettuce leaf with other herbs, but we didn't have any

@eleanorwhybird and I first learned how to make these from our roommate @hailynguyen9191 when we were all living in Japan and Ly hosted her Betoaji cooking classes in Kyoto. This brings back fun memories with some of my favourite people :) and it tastes amazing - please make it. ⁣
