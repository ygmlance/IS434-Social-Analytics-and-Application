12 MAY 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 36

Day 36 - #circuitbreakersg
🍙
Was thinking what to draw and recalled a child drawing cute sushi a few days ago.
Perfect fit as I was craving for some sushi/Japanese food too.
🍱
I hope my drawing supplies will last me through till the shops are open.
🎨
Back to new work week tomorrow and hope it will be a peaceful one.
