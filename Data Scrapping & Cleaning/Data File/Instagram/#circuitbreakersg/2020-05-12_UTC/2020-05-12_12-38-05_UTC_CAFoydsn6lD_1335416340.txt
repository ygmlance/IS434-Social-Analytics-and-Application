My weight loss journey during this #circuitbreakersg period. Started on a plant based diet at the end of March and added intermittent fasting about 2 weeks ago as well. Surprised by how I could adapt to not eating meat in a flash. I guess watching #gamechanger helped. 
Been taking my weight 2-3 times daily: once in the morning, once before breaking fast and once in the evening after PT. Been exercising more by running (to achieve my 150 minutes of activity weekly) and working out using the #7minuteworkout and #hasfittribe on YouTube.
