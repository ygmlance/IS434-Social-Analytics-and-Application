As we get to Day 36 of Singapore's Circuit Breaker, try different stuff at home and do everything that you have always wanted to do but never had the time to eg. exercise. There aren't many excuses you can find for yourself now. All it takes is 15min and a towel/exercise mat. If you need an exercise buddy online, message me and we can do a Zoom or WhatsApp Video workout session together in the evening. Let's stay SAFE and stay SANE together!
