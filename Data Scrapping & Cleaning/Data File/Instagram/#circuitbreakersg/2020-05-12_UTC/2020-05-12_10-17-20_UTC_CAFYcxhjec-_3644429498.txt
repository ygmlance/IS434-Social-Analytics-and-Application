【With Recipe 🍞 】⁣
Some of you have asked me for the Sakura Anpan recipe and also what type of azuki bean I used. So here is the recipe. ⁣⁣ Only one proofing! ☝🏻
⁣⁣
𝕀𝕟𝕘𝕣𝕖𝕕𝕚𝕖𝕟𝕥𝕤 (7” square tin)⁣⁣
260g Bread flour⁣⁣
3 gr Instant dry yeast⁣⁣
180g Liquid (one egg+ full cream milk)⁣⁣
30g Sugar⁣⁣
30g Butter⁣⁣
⁣⁣
𝕊𝕥𝕖𝕡𝕤: ⁣⁣
1. Soak the Sakura flowers and pat dry with kitchen towel. (Set aside)⁣⁣
2. Mix all ingredients (except butter and Sakura flowers) together and knead till you get a smooth and elastic dough (about 10 minutes)⁣⁣
3. Add butter and a little red colouring (you can omit) and continue to knead till window pane stage. ⁣⁣
4. Divide dough into 9 portions (60g each), and form into a ball. ⁣⁣
5. Fill up with azuki bean and wrap into a ball. ⁣⁣
6. Please them on a lined tin. Put the dough side by side. ⁣⁣
7. Place Sakura flowers on each of the dough. ⁣⁣
8. Proof the dough for 30 minutes. Rise till dough reaches 90% of height of pan (I proof it in microwave at 40C) ⁣⁣
9. Bake at 170C for 10min at lower rack and turn it to 150C for another 10min. (Note if want to have no browning, bake at 150C from start) ⁣⁣
