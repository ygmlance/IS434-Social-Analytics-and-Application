🍽BACK IN BUSINESS || Our first batch of bakes have been successfully delivered 🍩🍪 hehe! Thank you for all the support so far, feeling really blessed and happy 🥳 heh. DM us to order and whatever enquires you have!

On a side note, even though.. getting ingredients can be such a chore nowadays 😢sometimes I worry too much about not having enough ingredients for the bakes.. while I roll in bed worrying, I often pray and tell God about it and I’ll always drift off to sleep after praying.

And really, God is good all the time 😭 I always manage to get MOST of the ingredients that I need/want. Still in the process of trying not to worry and trusting God that whatever I need, it’ll come when I need it😇 and also my dad has really been awesome, helping me to find/source for ingredients so I’m super appreciative for that hehe.
