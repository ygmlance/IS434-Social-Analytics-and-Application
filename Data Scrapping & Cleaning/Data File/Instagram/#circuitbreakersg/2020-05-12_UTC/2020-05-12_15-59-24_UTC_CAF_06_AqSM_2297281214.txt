Dessert on day 36... Had so much ginger leftover in the fridge that I bashed some with the mortar and pestle and boiled some sweet ginger soup (sweetened with Lakanto)... This is absolutely my favourite sweet soup to go with the black sesame and peanut tang yuan (glutinous rice balls)... üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
