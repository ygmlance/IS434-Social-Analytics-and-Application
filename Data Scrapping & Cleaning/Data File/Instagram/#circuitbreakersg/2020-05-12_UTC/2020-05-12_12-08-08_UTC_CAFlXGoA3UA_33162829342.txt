portuguese egg tarts!! the last time I made these the crust wasnâ€™t as flaky so today I tried another recipe and yesss it turned out better! had to repeat the knead dough, spread butter, refrigerate dough process thrice ğŸ˜® took around 3 hrs (half the time was waiting for it to chill in the fridge I even took a nap) and the recipe gave me twice the amount of custard...but rly the tart not bad so am gonna make more now!!! ğŸ¤ª
