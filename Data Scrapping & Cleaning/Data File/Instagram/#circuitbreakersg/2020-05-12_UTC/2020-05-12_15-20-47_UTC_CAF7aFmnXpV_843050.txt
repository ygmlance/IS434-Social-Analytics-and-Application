#homemade Yong Tau Foo for today’s lunch! Instead of buying ready-made ones from the market, I decided to try my hand at making my own. Bought the #veggies & #beancurd and added fish paste to them.. it was actually quite a #fun process!

I used @liloikanbilis powder for the stock, and added just a splash of light soy sauce for colour & savouriness. This simple but nutritious Noodle Soup is the taste of my childhood, just like how my Mum would cook this dish, and I’m glad I’ve managed to replicate it. .
