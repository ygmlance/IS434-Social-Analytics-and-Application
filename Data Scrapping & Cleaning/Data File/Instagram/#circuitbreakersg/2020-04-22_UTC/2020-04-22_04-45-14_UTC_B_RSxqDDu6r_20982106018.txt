Thanks everybody for the support! We are into the 2nd week of our ZOOM workout and we are already seeing a big jump from just 6-10 pariticipants from our first session to 25-30 pax this week. I want to thank @farijx for guiding me to making this happen, and of course my talented team of trainers @madmooomooo @adam_t_flex @lapetitfeu @shaunlyc @tim_the_star @kyraderrickfitness for making this possible, without you guys, this will never come to fruition. Thank you all! Lets continue to get fit together, tonight with Arwyn's thematic Chair workout.

WhatsApp Jovin at +65 9145 0605 now and I will send you the link to the room. For newcomers please come 10mins before we start, to troubleshoot your video, and audio issues that you may have. Class starts at 6pm sharp 
Thank you ðŸ˜Š
