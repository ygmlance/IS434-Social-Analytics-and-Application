Itâ€™s a homecooked BKT kinda day, with our favourite beancurd skin that somehow looks like a cosy blanket lending some warmth and comfort in such uncertain times. And weâ€™re almost halfway through the circuit breaker, def looking forward to the day when we can finally dine with our family in the same setting ðŸ¤— #circuitbreakersg #stayhome
