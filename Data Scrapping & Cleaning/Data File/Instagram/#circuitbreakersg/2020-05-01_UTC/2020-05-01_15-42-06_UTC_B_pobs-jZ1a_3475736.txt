Day 25 of circuit breaker, I let Leodys take off the masking tapes on the floor. This is to let him improve his fine motor skill and also to let him explore the sticky sensation. As the masking tape stick on his hand, he will need to think how to remove it. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #hbl #homebasedlearning #homebasedactivities #finemotorskills #finemotoractivity #maskingtapegames #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
