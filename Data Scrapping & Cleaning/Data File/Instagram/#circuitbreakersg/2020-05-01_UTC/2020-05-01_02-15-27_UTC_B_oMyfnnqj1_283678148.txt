Recently redesigned my work space for productivity and ergonomics! 😊👍🌿 Here are some things which worked for me

1. Get a standing desk: A standing desk should not replace sitting entirely but should complement it. For every 1 to 2 hours you sit, 1 hour should be spent standing. I'm using the Omnidesk Pro 2020 
2. Do consider enhancing your workstation with plants as they have been scientifically proven to enhance productivity by 15%, lower physiological stress, increase attention span, and improve well-being.

3. Get rid of clutter: Cluttered spaces can have negative effects on our stress and anxiety levels, as well as our ability to focus
