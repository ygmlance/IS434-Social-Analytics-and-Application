Day 25 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (1 May 2020) - #lunch following a chef #gordonramsay recipe; spicy tuna cakes made from #cannedtuna  I was looking forward to making this again as my dearest mum, who was an amazing cook of Asian cuisine, had once asked me for the recipe, which was as good as her saying, "very good!" Unfortunately, this time I added too much fish sauce (shaky hands from hunger ðŸ˜†), making it too salty and the exterior was also not crispy enough. I adjusted the recipe a bit cos I was making a bigger portion and got it wrong, could do with a bit more spring onions and kaffir lime leaves as well. As always, I scrambled the #leftover egg mixture with the bits and pieces of ingredients and slurped it all up! #nowaste #stayhomewithascott #stayhomestaysafe everyone! #homecooking
