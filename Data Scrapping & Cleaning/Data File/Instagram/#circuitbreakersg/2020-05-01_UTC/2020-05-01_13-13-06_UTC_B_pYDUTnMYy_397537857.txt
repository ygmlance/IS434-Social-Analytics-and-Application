#CircuitBreakerSG D-25
We're having Nasi Lemak for #dinner tonight.  The rice was cooked with pandan leaf, coconut oil, ginger slices and salt.

Serving my Nasi Lemak with Chicken Rendang, Acar, Fried Egg and Whitebaits. Sorry my Chicken Rendang wasn't crispy ðŸ¤­

Was craving for cockles after seeing my sister's. Immediately bought some after spotting at @ColdStorageSG. Dipped with some homemade chilli sauce using chilli padi, garlic, ginger, lime juice, salt, sugar, sesame oil & hot water. Another satisfying meal.

Happy May Day.
