Day 25 Circuit  Breaker Meal:  Today is May Day, a public holiday, but does it makes any difference? Every day seems like a PH. There is nowhere to go except to stay at home. So, find joy in posting food and counting days. Simple breakfast, Fried Rice for lunch and Hokkien Mee for dinner. Miss my #hawker food!
