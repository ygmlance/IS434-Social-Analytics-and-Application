Since it's labour day, I decided to take the day OFF from work & rest! Roasted a simple rosemary butterfly chicken with mixed vegetables for lunch today & pandan chiffon for afternoon tea! 
Dinner was tabao-ed today coz I totally had no idea what to cookðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Was busy baking my bread in between dinner time...that would be for breakfast tmrðŸ˜‰
