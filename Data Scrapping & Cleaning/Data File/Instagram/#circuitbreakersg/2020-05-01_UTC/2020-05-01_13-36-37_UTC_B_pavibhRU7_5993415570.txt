"I can't lose weight because I love to eat!" ⁣😍⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Girl, let's be honest - it is SO. NOT. TRUE! 🙅🏻‍♀️⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
As I always share with my clients, the key to eating your favorite food AND still managing your weight lies in 👉🏻 𝐧𝐮𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐛𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
What does that mean? It means that you cut out the foods that you don't really care about because they don't give you much pleasure, and that you are picky about indulging in the food that actually "hit the spot" for you.⁣🤩⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Think about it like money💵. You cut back your spending on things that don't really add to your life, and splurge on the precious things or experiences that really make an impactful difference to you.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Let me give you some personal examples:⁣⁣⁣
