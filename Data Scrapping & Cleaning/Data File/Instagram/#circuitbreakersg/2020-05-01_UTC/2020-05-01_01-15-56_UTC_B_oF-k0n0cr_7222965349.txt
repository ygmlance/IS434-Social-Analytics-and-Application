This is a tough one for me because I added all my favourites 🙈 I can hardly choose. But if I HADDDD to choose I’m a 2, but really would love a 1 as well (@carrotsticksandcravings coconut milk latte makes me feel like I’m on a tropical vacation even during #circuitbreakersg ). If I’m being an exceptionally thoughtful wife and thinking about @ndewhurst then maybe a 4 🤪⁣⁣
