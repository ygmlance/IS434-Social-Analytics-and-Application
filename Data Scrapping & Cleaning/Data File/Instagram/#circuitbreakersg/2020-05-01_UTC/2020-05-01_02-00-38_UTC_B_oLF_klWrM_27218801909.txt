To all frontline workers who are fighting for us in this battlefield to help us stay safe, thank you!

To all essential workers who are still heading out to work everyday and provide your services, thank you!

Letâ€™s not forget the rest of the people who are working from home, thank you for doing your part and staying home.

Wishing all a Happy Labour Day and we will get through this together!
