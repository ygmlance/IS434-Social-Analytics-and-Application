Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 25:
Since it's a public holiday today, I decided to try another beef stew recipe from @justonecookbook! This time I made pressure cooker beef stew with daikon and oyster mushrooms.

Because I added so much daikon and mushrooms to the pot, I had to double the amount of liquid to cook it. Interesting how the cooking process for this braised beef is different from the Galbi Jjim I made last week. I had to sear the beef before leaving it to braise and stew for 40 minutes.

The flavour of this short rib recipe seems stronger and also resulted in more liquid as compared to the nikujaga. Warm, delicous and flavorful! We enjoyed this with some radish kimchi on the side. 
Love how the pressure cooker reduces the cooking time! Will have to try using the pressure cooker for the galbi jjim recipe to see if I can shorten the cooking time.
