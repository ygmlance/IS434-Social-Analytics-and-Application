Day 25 of #circuitbreaker: Mother’s Day is coming & even more so I miss my mum. It seems we haven been taking much photos together & this is a #throwback photo few years ago. Physically apart but mentally connected. Into the 2nd month of not seeing her, now we can only FaceTime. My mum raise my sis & I single handedly when my dad passed away. I’m grateful for her for giving me a good education that I may pass down to my daughter. Proud to say we are 3 generations of convent girls :) Make it 4 next time I hope ❤️ Motherhood is not easy, now I finally understand her struggles when kids don’t listen, oops 😬⁣
