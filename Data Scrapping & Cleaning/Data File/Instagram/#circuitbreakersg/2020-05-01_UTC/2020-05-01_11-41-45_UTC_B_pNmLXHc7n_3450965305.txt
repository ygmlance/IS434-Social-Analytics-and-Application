Today's snack! Made muah Chee with sesame powder! But because I only have 1 packet of sesame powder left, I mixed the other half of the muah Chee with peanuts powder...
.
.Looks can be deciving! Doesn't look good but Taste's not bad! I like the texture too! The mum and the hubs approve too! Yay~~~✌️
