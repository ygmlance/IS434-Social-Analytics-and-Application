To the brick workers who helped laid the foundation of Singapore and the medical and healthcare front liners risking your lives at such a time as this, this day belongs to you. ðŸ¥‚

Really wishes you all a happy and relaxing Labour Day for all your relentless and dedicated hardwork! Time to kick those feet up, relax and have a slice or cake or whatever it is you are craving for, cause you deserve it!

For those who are still working hard at the front lines, stay safe and keep well! We salute you and THANK YOU!
