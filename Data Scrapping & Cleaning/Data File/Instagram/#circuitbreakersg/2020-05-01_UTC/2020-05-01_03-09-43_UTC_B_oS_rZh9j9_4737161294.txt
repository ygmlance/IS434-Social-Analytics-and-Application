"Power comes from people because their trust gives me strength."
⠀
These are the faces behind the scenes that make things happen at Kim San Leng, and have demonstrated immense strength in times of uncertainty. Throughout this pandemic and #circuitbreakersg, they have turned up to work with a smile on their faces ... no less, to make sure that business carries on as usual, adhering to the current measures of course!
⠀
With that said, from all of us at Kim San Leng and beyond ... THANK YOU! ❤️
⠀
And as the Korean's say ... #fighting! 💪🏻
