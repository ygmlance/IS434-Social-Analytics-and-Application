Cooling day calls for smth hot and spicy. So here’s Mum’s specialty - curry chicken for dinner tonight! 🥘
✨
Used homemade spice paste with recipe adapted from @honeybeesweets.sg as usual. Anw, these 2 bowls are not mine cos mine (not pictured) has more chilli added for extra spice heheh. Loving this one pot goodness of chicken wings, chicken breast, potatoes, pumpkin and cabbage! You can add what you like actually! Served with traditional baguette from @petitpain.sg (which’s so crusty on the outside and chewy inside after being toasted) and Japanese mixed rice! 🥖🍚
✨
Happy Labour Day all! 😊
