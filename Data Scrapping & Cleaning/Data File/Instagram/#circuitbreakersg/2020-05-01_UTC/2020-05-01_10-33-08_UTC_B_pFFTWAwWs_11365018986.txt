Happy Labour Day Long Weekend! 
I have honestly lost count of the number of days that have passed (can someone please remind me again, which day of the #circuitbreakersg we’re at now??)... I guess that has always been my life’s philosophy- living each day to the fullest and doing the best that you can. That includes “showing up” and making that workout count, not for others but for yourself.

I miss my pilates chair but, no chair never mind. Just improvise. Quick snippet of chair-based classes and I can’t wait for my regulars to have a go of them. 👻 They’re not on IG! 🤣
