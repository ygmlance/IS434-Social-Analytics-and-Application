A translated Bengali poem to accompany the distance, with words I cannot simply say on my own.  With gratitude and love. ~ Emylia Safian

Song (Ajo Dhoroni) by Kazi Nazrul Islam

Half of the world is dark.
The other haIf has light -
It heralds the dawn of
Someone's sorrowful night.

Half is hard earth,
The other half is water;
Half is full of thorn,
The other half is flower.

Half is melody,
The other half is wine,
Half abounds in hope -
Lonely hearts pine.

Half remains hidden,
The other half is known;
Half is full of love,
The other half disown.

Half of it is dawn,
The other half is twilight-
Half of it is dew,
And a moiety sunlight. [Translation: Syed Mujibul Huq]
