Happy Labour Day!

Sharing some new food I tried!

Portobello stuffed w capsicum, tomato topped with cheese. I always like to eat mushroom this way. I tried cooking with air fryer previously and never really succeed (so simple dish also can fail, right?) Anyway I think I was too tired and I cooked the mushrooms without the cheese! Only realised after itâ€™s done.. Then I saw the milo cake from @j3raine story and went to @vannytelly acct to check it out. I didnâ€™t have 3-in-1 milo and condensed milk. So I made it with 81g of milo powder and one egg and steamed for 20 mins! Itâ€™s so thin because I used too big a plate.. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ Warning: itâ€™s super heaty.

How has your #circuitbreakersg  days been so far? Jack will be returning to office next week and we will have another round of adjustments to make. For now, let me enjoy the holidayyyyyyyy
