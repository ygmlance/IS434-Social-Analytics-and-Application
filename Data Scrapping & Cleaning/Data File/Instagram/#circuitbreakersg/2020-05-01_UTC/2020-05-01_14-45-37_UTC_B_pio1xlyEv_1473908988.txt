Good luck to Singapore

4 years ago, I unwillingly gave up my big dream. This made me fall into serious heartbreak. Then, I visited Singapore as a sentimental journey. Singaporean treated me very kindly and encouraged me to resurge despite of the tragedy by Japanese in WWII. After that, I always appreciate them from the bottom of my heart. I sincerely hope she will be able to revive completely as soon as possible.
