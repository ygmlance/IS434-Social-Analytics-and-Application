It was a heartfelt night of listening to Mingda’s journey in becoming a magician, juicy info of how M&N got together. It was also exciting when Mingda performed some magic tricks. I enjoyed the singing/duets between M&N and finally, I failed in my Salsa sauce… dance I mean… hahaha #PTL #sgcircuitbreaker #sgstayathome #circuitbreakersg #stayathomesg #stayhomeforSG #SingaporeTogether #SGunited #lihosingapore #talkshow #IGlive #labourdayspecial #talkshowwithjeff
