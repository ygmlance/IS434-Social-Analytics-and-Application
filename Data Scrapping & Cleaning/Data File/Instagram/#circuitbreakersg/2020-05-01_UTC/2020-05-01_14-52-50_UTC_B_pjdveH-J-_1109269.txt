Day 12 activity 
Category: Science experiment 
What is it: Milk and dish soap fun
Materials you need: 
Dishwashing soap, shallow tray/plate, cotton buds, food colouring 
Difficulty level to make: easy
Duration of activity: 15-20 minutes, depending on how many rounds you allow your child to do
Objectives: see the reaction of milk and soap

How to play: 
Drip a few drops of food colouring into a shallow tray. Dip the cotton buds into dish washing soap then into the shallow tray of milk. See how the food coloring moves.

Side note:
You can google for the “soap and milk experiment” on the scientific explanation about what is happening between the soap/milk and food colour. 
My own review:
During a STEM experiment that we do at home, always keep your questions to open ended kind. Refrain from asking your child, “is it ...” with an expected “yes or no” as an answer.
Try this instead:
“What do you think is happening...?”
“Why does this...?”
“How do you do think...?” Remember how our teachers apply the 5W and 1H on us? You can use them on your children too!
Have fun and lots of laughter!
