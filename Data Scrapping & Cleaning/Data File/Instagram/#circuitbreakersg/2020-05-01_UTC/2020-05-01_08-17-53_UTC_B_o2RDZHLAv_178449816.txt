Day 25 of #CircuitBreakersg
~~~~~~~~~~~
First time frying carrot cake. This is made completely from scratch starting with grating the radish! Watch my instastories for the trials! Won’t share the recipe just yet because I intend to tweak it. This one is just a bit too thick despite all the radish that went in. Not really very effortful to make either. It’s pretty simple actually!
