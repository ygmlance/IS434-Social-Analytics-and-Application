Frankincense essential oil has been prize as “King of Essential Oils” by many for a reason, ie. It does a little bit of everything. I find that using Frankincense in the evening help me fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply. This has a huge impact on my day because I find that my energy level is better and feel less tired. I use my diffuser in my bedroom with 3 drops of Frankincense, Lavender and Geranium an hour before bedtime and shut the door. When I enter my bedroom, the aroma cues my brain and body that it is time for sleep. Enjoy! 😴 #essentialoils #aromatherapy #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #stayhealthy #sleepwell #naturalremedies
