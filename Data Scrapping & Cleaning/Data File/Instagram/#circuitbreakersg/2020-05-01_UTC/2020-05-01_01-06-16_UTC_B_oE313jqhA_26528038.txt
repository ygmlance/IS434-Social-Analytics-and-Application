My home has become all things to me these past three months- school, spa, fancy date night restaurant, movie theater, gym (ha! That one time!), cafe (what up Dalgona?!), and now club. Too bad I can’t play the music I like around my kids. Don’t need them learning those words (yet... I know they will one day). Thankfully my son still thinks “stupid” is the worst word you can say. 😅 I honestly don’t know how I haven’t slipped in front of them.... even when driving. I use Southern phrases instead like “Bless her heart 😏” or “son of a biscuit!”. Even when I popped my eardrum I somehow channeled the anger and pain into “what in the holy heck?!”. Oh if my friends could hear me now. They would pull me away and blast Southern rap in my ears until I was back to my old self. Until then I remain brainwashed by toddler TV in the house I never leave. 😅
