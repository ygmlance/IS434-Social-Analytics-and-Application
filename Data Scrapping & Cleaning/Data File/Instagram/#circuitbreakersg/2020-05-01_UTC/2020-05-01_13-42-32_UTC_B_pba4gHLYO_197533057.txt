Naan is an Indian delicacy that has reached immense popularity and is synonymous with Indian food. However Naans are rarely made in an Indian household and it was brought by the Mughals to India to the imperial court of Delhi in the 14 Centur𝙮 . Naan employs techniques similar to bread in terms of dough rise and proofing. Traditionally cooked in a tandoor a heavy bottom pan or Dutch oven works wonders for a #homemadenaan

What you need:
👉🏼2 cups all purpose flour +1 tbsp for dusting
👉🏼 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
👉🏼2 tbsp milk
👉🏼1 tsp yeast
👉🏼1/2 tsp salt & sugar
👉🏼1 tbsp oil
👉🏼75 ml water(add as you go)
👉🏼1 tsp ghee (butter) to coat
👉🏼 Topping: sesame, scallions, green Chili, coriander, butter,garlic powder

How to whip it up:
✅In a large bowl, sift the  flour salt and sugar together. Next add in the Greek yogurt & 2 tbsp of milk and knead
✅ Knead thé flour till  it just about starts to clump and slowly add water till a smooth dough is formed. This will take about 15-20 mins of kneading. Coat with a light layer of ghee/ butter
✅Rest the dough for 1-2 hours with a damp clean cloth over it
✅Once the dough has risen, knock out the air from it and knead it into small rounds. Let it rise for a 2nd time for about 30 mins
✅Flatten the dough flat on a board with your hand dusting some flour as needed
✅Press the toppings into the flattened dough and transfer to a hot Dutch Oven or heavy bottom pan. Drizzle some butter, Cover and cook for 5 minutes. I used some mozzarella for a cheesy topping with the other condiments
✅Serve hot with a spicy Indian curry or dal!
