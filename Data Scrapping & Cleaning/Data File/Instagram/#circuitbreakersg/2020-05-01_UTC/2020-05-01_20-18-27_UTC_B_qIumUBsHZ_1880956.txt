Alhamdullilah. Turned 40 two days ago.
This is truly, a birthday like no other. I‚Äôm sure many, who celebrated or is celebrating their birthdays right now would say the same too.

It was a fuss-free celebration. HBLs in the morning for Aydan and Aadil, cluster feeds throughout the day with Amelie, surprise deliveries from family and friends,a sumptuous iftar spread from one of my favourite restaurants and a game of Jenga to end the evening. While this year‚Äôs celebration would be one of the quietest, it was also the most meaningful one. 
But @nazrihadi why no flowers or gifts from you ah? Milestone birthday leh. Because circuit breaker is it? üßê
