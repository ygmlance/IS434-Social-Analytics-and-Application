May Day lunch was an #Italian due of #seafood and #mushroom #risotto ðŸ˜‹ #Prawn heads and shells for the stock, generous chunks of red grouper , sea prawns and squid made it heaven for the seafood lover I am! #Portbello  and button mushrooms for the risotto with a drizzle of olive oil was complete with a sprinkling of truffle ðŸ˜€ #Sgig #igsg #foodie #foodporn #quarantinefood #circuitbreakersg #homecooked #foodstagram #foodiesofinstagram
