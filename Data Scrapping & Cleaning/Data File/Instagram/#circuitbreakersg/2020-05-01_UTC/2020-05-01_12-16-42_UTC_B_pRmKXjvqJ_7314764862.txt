Because of this #circuitbreakersg a lot of humans has been taking photos or videos of them being a masterchef at home.. uploading yum yum food that they didn't realise they can actually cook so well in the past!

So here's my dinner from @the.raw.bowl â˜º
.
@zenergy_pet_sg : NutrEats Whole King Salmon (but mama cut into half)
.
@kinandkind : Pumpkin Fiber

@k9natural @howlisticlife : Lamb Green Tripe Booster
