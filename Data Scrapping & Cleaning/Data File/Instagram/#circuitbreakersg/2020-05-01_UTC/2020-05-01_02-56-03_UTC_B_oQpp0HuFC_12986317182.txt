Back in 2019, I complain I travel too much for work. Now I really miss Changi Airport smell and having the whole hotel room to myself. ⁣
⁣
Random things I do alone in the hotel room include ⁣
⁣
💘 playing with SNOW stickers until I sian cos I super scared⁣
💘 request all pillows from the pillow menu (my record was 8 pillows in 4 nights) and build my own pillow fort. ⁣
💘 on TV loud loud just in case⁣
⁣
What are some of the random things you do while being alone? ⁣
