So much has changed over the past year, and I want you to remember that every birthday signifies a new chapter in your life. I wish that you continue to do good things and fill this new chapter with amazing memories. So here's to spending more unforgettable moments, late night gossips, Sephora shopping, soccer matches, Netflix binging and chillin with gin o'clock. Happiest birthday Prima! ðŸ’• Many people do not have sisters by blood but they have cousin sisters who are as amazing as sisters - and I'm glad that you are one of them. ðŸŽ‚ðŸ˜˜
