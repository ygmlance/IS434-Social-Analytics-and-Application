#circuitbreakerday24 // Have wanted to make a #yoghurtpizza since the Ievinses gave me a warm bed and fed me a much better version of this #uglydelicious-ness a lifetime ago. .
A simple yoghurt x self-raising flour combo, holding up oozing bubbling mozzarella on smashed tomatoes, topped with an egg and leaves from Hume II(a) the #basilplant - perfect for standing and eating hot from the oven, while dripping wet, having just gotten in from the day’s crashing thunderstorm.

Interesting chats recently about why celebrity culture isn’t doing well in the #newnormal, when you’d have thought people were wanting a bit of distraction from the crisis.
.
• Is it the lack of new influencer content? .
• Is it that their maudlin songs or words of encouragement sit wrong when, in some countries, they have privileged access to medical treatment and a sprawling mansion to do their #stayhomechallenge in?
.
• Is it that celebrities getting #covid19 and dying from it makes us realise that they too are dust like us? Not just the fragility of fame, but of life itself?
