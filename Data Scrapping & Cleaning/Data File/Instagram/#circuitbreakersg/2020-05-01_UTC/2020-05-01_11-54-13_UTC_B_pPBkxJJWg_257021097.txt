What’s for dinner? It’s pizza night for @flofongsg, courtesy of @extravirginpizza. Her first time trying it, believe it or not, and she declares the perfumey Roasted Shrooms pie her fave. A blend of 3 umami cheeses, roasted rosemary mushrooms & truffle oil on crispy crust. A close second is the Pepper Pig, draped with salty, yummy guanciale, pepperoni & sausage. Delivery available, of course. .
