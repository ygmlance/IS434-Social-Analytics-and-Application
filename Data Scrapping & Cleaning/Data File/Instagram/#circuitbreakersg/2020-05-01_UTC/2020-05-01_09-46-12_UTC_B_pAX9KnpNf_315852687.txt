I am staying home and working from home since 7 Mar 2020 (actually much earlier than that 😅, doing my best not to go out unnecessarily) .
.
Happy Labour Day and follow by a restful weekend. .
.
Thankful and gratitude towards all the essentials professionals and workers who are holding fort in their respective roles and keeping all of us safe. ❤️ .
.
We come together to fight against this #covid19 pandemic and a lot of mommies who are also taking on multiple roles with #WFH #HBL during this time. .
.
What have I been doing at home? Pictures speak a thousand words (swipe ⬅️ to view) 😁 We look like super #enterprising (like doing big business or project together ya 🤣) Time for us to bond together, #onlinelearning and learn cooking and baking at home and many more. How about you? .
.
I would like to nominate @sgsupernanny and @melissalondonmickey to share their #stayhomechallenge as we have been always virtually together despite #socialdistancing and they are the ones who keep encouraging me to explore #tiktok and watch #netflix 😆 .
