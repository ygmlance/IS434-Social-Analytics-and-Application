Happy Labour Day!
From home...to hand to heart.
.
Our jobs allow us to take a breather today on Labour day but as working parents, we know how very hard it is to balance work demands with home. More so now as essential workers have to be exposed to the risks of #covid_19 .
.
Doing our bid to show appreciation to the workers and countrymen who are working today to maintain normalcy and keep essential services going.

Photos: The wife got the kids to prepare a basket of their favorite snacks ( a bit of ‘sacrifice’ on the kids’ part) for delivery workers. The wife has also printed some ‘Thank you’ posters too to show our appreciation.
.
No man is an island. We all need each other. It’s nice to show appreciation for one another. It’s human.

Happy Labour Day!
