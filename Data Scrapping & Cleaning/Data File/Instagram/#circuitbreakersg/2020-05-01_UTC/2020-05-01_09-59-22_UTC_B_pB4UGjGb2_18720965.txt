Day 25 of #circuitbreakersg. Seems like an eternity. So to reward ourselves for being patient and staying home I’ve made our favourite food. BBQ pork ribs coz we missed TGIF so much! It’s worth all the hard work put into making this ribs. Coz it’s so soft and melt in the mouth meat just makes me go ooo and ahh when eating it. Excellent with salads too. Hmmm cravings satisfied.  So what’s gonna be my next meal.... #homecooked #homecooking #BBQRibs #TGIF #westernfood #missingthelongislandtea #singapore #chefathome #dinnertime #pork #salads #instafood #foodporn #sgig #sgigfoodie
