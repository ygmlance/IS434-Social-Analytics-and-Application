My first char siew! OMG ... marinated for 2 days, steamed, roasted and charcoal grilled! Try this recipe from Leslie Tay (http://ieatishootipost.sg/leslie-char-siu-recipe/) Definitely worth doing. I tweaked some ingredients for preference and finished off on the charcoal grill but this recipe is a good base for anyone who wants to try!  #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #homecooking #charsiew #charcoalgrill #delicious @ieatishootipost
