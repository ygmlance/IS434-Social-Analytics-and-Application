It's a lock down in most countries given the current situation and it's no different here in Singapore. The only thing that probably sets Singapore apart from the rest of the world is that we are technically not under a lock down. It's a "circuit breaker" measure as they term it.

This is also the time where there's absolutely minimal traffic on the streets and a rare time when you can see places that are usually bustling with people, quiet and empty.

Let's not get too used to this rare sight and pray that things get back to normal in no time! Stay safe everyone!
