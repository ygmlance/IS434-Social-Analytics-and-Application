CB DAY 26 -

There are good days and bad days with Isabel, our 4 months old baby. But when I watch josiah play and learn at his age, I am motivated once again to give my all to her as well.

It isn't easy at all, but it is worth fighting for. ðŸ’•

Happy Labour day to all  WFH parents! Jiayou!! #jalja18 #homebasedlearning #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
