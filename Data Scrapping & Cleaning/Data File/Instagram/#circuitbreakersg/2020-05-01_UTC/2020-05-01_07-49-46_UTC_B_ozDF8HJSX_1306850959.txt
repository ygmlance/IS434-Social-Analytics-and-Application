🌼May every day bring some new happiness. 🌼Yeah! I’m sure everyone is happy today because it is a public holiday- Labour Day!!! Public holiday seems especially precious during this circuit breaker period. 🤣Today, I tried boiling soft boiled eggs - yakun style (for hubby) and hard boiled eggs (for myself) , which turns out perfect with this magic prop from Daiso! I just have to put it in the pot of water with the eggs and watch the colour change, which will reflect the boiling status of the eggs! So, here I have smashed hard-boiled eggs spread on Hello Kitty-shaped bread, a few butter cookies and blueberries, paired with milo. Perfect! ✌️✌️✌️
