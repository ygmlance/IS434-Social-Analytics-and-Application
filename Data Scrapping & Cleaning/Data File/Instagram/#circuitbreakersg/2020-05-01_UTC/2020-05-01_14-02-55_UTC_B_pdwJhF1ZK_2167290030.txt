DAY 25 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
CHHOLE BHATOORE 
When the going gets tough, the tough get going 💪🏼💪🏼
Thats what we teach our children, with the hope that when times are difficult, they can sail through it without breaking under the stress. And nothing makes a mother more proud, than to see her little boys turn into  responsible young men. The only exoectation my young men have from me is a good meal .... every time!! 😉
I try my best
So all this was made for my darling boy who came  home from camp tonight. He enjoyed the meal, and that made all the effort worth it.
