Personally I love lavender in almost everything and I like green tea. Thus this tea option is great for me as it comprises of both lavender and green tea. You can smell and taste a hint of the lavender as you sip the tea, which for me is perfect. For me, I can drink it any time of the day, which makes it great too. I would definitely recommend this tea to anyone whom likes/loves having lavender in their tea. So do give it a try.
