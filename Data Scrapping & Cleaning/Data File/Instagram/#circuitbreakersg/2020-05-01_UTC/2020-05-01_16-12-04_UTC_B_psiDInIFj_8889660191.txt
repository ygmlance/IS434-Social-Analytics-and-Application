We have a loooot of time to be creativ during this â€žlockdownâ€œ periode and hence I bought some canvas for my boys.
They were free to try different paints and techniques - my dining table was full of colour as well (One of the reasons I am not allowed to buy a new dining table from @castlerysg ðŸ¤£).
