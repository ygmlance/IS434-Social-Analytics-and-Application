Today is #InternationalLabourDay

A day when we celebrate and appreciate people who have put in their hard labour to keep our society going.

This year is a tough year to celebrate #LabourDay due to #COVID19.

I chanced upon this #purple #flower when I masked up to drop my recyclables into the recycling bin.

Due to #CircuitBreakerSG period, the grass in our hometowns had not been trimmed for a month. 
This strong #seed grew in a difficult spot in a carpark lot. It strived till a pretty #purpleflower sprouted. Such is the #wonderofnature

#Strongwill 
#Survivalspirit

We will also emerge stronger.

#HappyLabourDay and many thanks to the frontliners who are still working on this public holiday to keep us safe and our society going. Salute U for your dedication ðŸ’•
