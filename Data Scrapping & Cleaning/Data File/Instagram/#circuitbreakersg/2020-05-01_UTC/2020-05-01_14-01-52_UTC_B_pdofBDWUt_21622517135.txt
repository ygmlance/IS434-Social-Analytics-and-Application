The only thing we can legitimately do outdoors now, is to pee and poop. #CircuitBreakerSG Momma says that in order to maximize our short time outdoors, I have to take up running too. This is hard work. Momma is firm about me doing it, rain or shine. She said that I have become seriously greedy, and Iâ€™ll balloon into a lump of lard by June. THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.
