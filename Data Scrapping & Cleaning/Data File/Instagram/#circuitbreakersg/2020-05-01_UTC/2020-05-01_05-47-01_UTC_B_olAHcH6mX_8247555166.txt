French butter croissant, from @bakerybrera! 🥐 ✨
Been having croissants so often recently, as I like that I can reheat them at home and it’ll taste as though it’s freshly out of the oven. Always seeing good reviews of the bakes from @bakerybrera, but the location is a bit off for me. Dropped by around late afternoon today and I managed to snag a plain croissant back! ✌🏻

Aesthetic wise, omg look at the perfect honeycomb texture which I’m so in awe of. The layers were so well made! Taste wise, it was quite buttery and to be honest, a tad too greasy for me. In fact, my parchment paper and plate were all soaked with oil after I reheated and ate it 🙊. The texture overall was quite soft (to the extent of being a little soggy), but the exterior was still crisp. Well, if only it was less greasy! 🧈
