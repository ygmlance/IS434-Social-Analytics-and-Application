💖There Are No Such Thing As Bad Weather... Not An Excuse For Me To Skip A Workout.💖
Feeling tired today don’t know is it because of the pouring rain or the time of the month... But seeing my pinky set up made me more motivated. 🤗
Loving my new pink ankle “boots”. Hahaha. Now I am only missing pink weight plates. Anyone knows where I custom in Singapore? 🤣
