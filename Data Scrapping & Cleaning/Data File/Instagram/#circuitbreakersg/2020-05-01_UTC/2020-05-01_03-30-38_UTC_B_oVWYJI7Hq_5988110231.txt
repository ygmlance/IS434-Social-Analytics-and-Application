This labour day, as most of us stay safe at home, we are more thankful than ever to all essential service workers who continue to work tirelessly to keep our nation running.⁠
⁠
Join us in sending our deepest gratitude to all the healthcare workers, cleaners, delivery riders, hawkers, food providers, service women and men: Thank you for keeping our homes safe and well.⁠
⁠
Happy Labour Day!⁠
