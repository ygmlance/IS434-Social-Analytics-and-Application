Round 2 of #ShisenHanten cos there were some items that I was interested in but didn't order the last round. This time we had the sweet & sour kurobuta pork in black vinegar 😍😋, fried rice with crab meat & fish roe, chicken with cashew nut & red pepper and string bean with minced pork. And since there is half price off the items now, I decided I might as well try the famous #chatterboxSG chicken rice. Turned out their fried hokkien mee is good. We also ordered a nasi goreng istimewa that is not in the pic.
