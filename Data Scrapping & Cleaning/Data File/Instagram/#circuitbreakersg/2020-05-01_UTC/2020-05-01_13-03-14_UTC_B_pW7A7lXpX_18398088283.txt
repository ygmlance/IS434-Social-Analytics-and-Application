Been wanting to try dumpling darlings since forever and finally got our hands on it for the fam thanks to their islandwide delivery (free delivery for this set yay!!) This set comes with a 30 dumplings mixed platter and 4 noodles boxes - we choose the original dumpling, veggie mandu, smoked duck, braised pork egg noodles and sichuan egg noodles🥟🥢 Got to say our favourite dumpling was the veggie mandu, a vegetarian option yet so flavourable and has a very meaty texture thanks to the mushrooms🤤Noodles wise, definitely prefer the sichuan noodles for that extra hint of spiceness🥳 The noodles and dumplings felt a tad too oily but totally worth the calories inhaled!! Also added on an extra box of noodles and together with the dumpling platter, it can comfortably feed 5 people💃
