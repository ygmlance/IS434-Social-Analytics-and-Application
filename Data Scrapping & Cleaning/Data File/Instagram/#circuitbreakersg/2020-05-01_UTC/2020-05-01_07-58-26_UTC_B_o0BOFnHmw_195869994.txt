[20.20 May 1: Circuit Breaker Day 25]

Happy Labour Day! Decided to try out the plank challenge with @xavier_chua.sg with a few NGs but definitely less than 15 attempts! Not too bad right!

His lao bu said to him 'I can't jump over you for sure, you jump ok while I roll! " ðŸ˜‚ eat and eat non-stop at home, sure can roll easily!
