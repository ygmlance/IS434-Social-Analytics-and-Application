; {Circuit Breaker Day 25}

Made chiffon cake for the first time! I’ve always thought they had high % of failure, plus I didn’t have a chiffon bundt pan haha.

Today, I used Joy of Baking’s chocolate chiffon cake recipe, and @ann_journal chocolate ganache cream.

Really glad it looks pretty good :). As usual my frosting skills are terrible hahaha. But I did the best I could :). Today is the first day of May and we still have to endure another month of CB. I wonder how life would be like after CB ends.

Stay safe, stay home everyone.
