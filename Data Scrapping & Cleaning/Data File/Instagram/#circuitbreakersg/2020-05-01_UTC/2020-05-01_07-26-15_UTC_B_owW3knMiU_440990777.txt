A surprising #mayday during this #circuitbreakersg day 25 
As I head to #lowerpiercereservoir for my #morningwalk was pleasantly greeted by a wild boar family herd chomping away their breakfast on the trail and a very interesting freshwater big fish with their young

I asked God this morning if He will let me see the wild boar community and it was very sweet of Him to indeed surprise me at such close proximity. It's His perfect timing that brought me to be at that part of the trail at the right time :) #happyme #landedflowers #wildboar #freshwaterfish
