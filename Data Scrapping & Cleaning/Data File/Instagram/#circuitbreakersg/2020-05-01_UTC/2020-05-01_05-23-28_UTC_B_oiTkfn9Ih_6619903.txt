Because thereâ€™ll never be another chance like this, I wriggled my little car through #hajilane today. I never would have dared or been able to in the past - either itâ€™s closed to traffic or Iâ€™m liable to mow down a hipster. All the same, I had to be very careful. Itâ€™s a delightful narrow street. All the flags out caught me by surprise. Had to pull over and cry for a bit. #flytheflag #circuitbreakersg #sgunited #sgunitedðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ #sgtogether #sgstrong
