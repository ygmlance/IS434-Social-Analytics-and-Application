Congratulations @little.blossomco for the launch of these yummy treats for the little ones! These organic brown rice puffs come in four flavours; pumpkin, sweet potato, strawberry and apple & broccoli. .

Mama loves that it has no added salt and sugar, and is preservative free! It is also gluten free, 100% natural and made with organic ingredients. .
.
The co-founders of @little.blossomco , Gillian and Yi Jun have also lovingly put together a compilation of parents’ stories, “In Time, We Blossom” to serve as a companion to all parents who are going through their personal struggles. Proud to see @jaclynmeiqi my partner for @colourmemats featured in there and read about her parenting journey. She’s one power Mama juggling three kids with no helper while working on our little venture! Beautiful work there @little.blossomco !.

Back to their healthy yummy treats, both Mama and Papa Chia tried them and got our stamp of approval! @little.blossomco is also running a launch day giveaway so hop on over to support this local business!
