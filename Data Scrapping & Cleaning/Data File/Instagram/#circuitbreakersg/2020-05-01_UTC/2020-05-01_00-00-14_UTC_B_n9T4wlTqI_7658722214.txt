Good morning everythingðŸ¤ª
.
Yesterday sis had the opportunity to go live via FB with Bonda Bedah & Mak Temah to share our story as a affected HBB
.
When the news was out about HBB, I start to got worried for my customer orders. I did cried and even when sending mass update via WhatsApp also i cried non-stop
.
I felt sad at the point of time
.
But with the courage and support from my customer it make wonder that why can't I be positive with the current situation
.
So i switch my energy from being sad to positive spirit!
.
So.. If you watch me smiling in the live yesterday or later you can catch up at their FB, because with a smile can boost your mood and othersðŸ˜‰
.
Oh. Thank you to Bonda Bedah & Mak Temah!
