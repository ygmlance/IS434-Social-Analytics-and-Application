There are so many ways to play around with this recipe. Here are some suggestions!

You could use taco seasonings to make Mexican stuffed peppers or add a handful of chopped parsley; or use different types of cheese if you prefer sharper cheese like cheddar; or even leave out the meat and use diced zucchini / carrots / more bell peppers instead.

Also, you could use any carbs you want - quinoa, brown rice, basmati rice... it’s a great way to use up leftover carbs in the fridge. Of course, you can leave out the carbs and just top up with more vegetables or protein.

I would recommend boiling the bell peppers first so that they turn out soft and juicy after baking. If you prefer something more crunchy, feel free to bake them without boiling!

It’s a great way to use up the bell peppers in the fridge. You can cook a batch and freeze them for meal prepping. Sooo versatile!

I hope you’ll try this out someday!
