Happy Mayday everybody! As we celebrate yet another long weekend from home, we thought we'd share some fun AND free things you can do this Labour Day weekend from the comfort of your couch! ðŸ›‹

And since we at OGS firmly believe that sharing is caring, we're also thinking about the vulnerable in our communities who may not be spending this long weekend safely at home like the rest of us. If it is within your means, you can contribute to #SGPaysItForward, an initiative that hopes to provide 100,000 Care Packs each containing a month's worth of sanitary essentials to Singapore's vulnerable communities.

P.S. You can access all the recommendations in the link in our bio â€“ don't say we good things never share hor ðŸ˜‰
