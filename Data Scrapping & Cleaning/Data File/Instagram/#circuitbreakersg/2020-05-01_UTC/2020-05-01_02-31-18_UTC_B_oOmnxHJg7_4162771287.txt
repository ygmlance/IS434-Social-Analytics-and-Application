Day 25 of circuit breaker (1/5/2020)
.
When you see postings of peanut pancake and crave for it.. just used whatever I have and done my own version of "peanut pancake"! 🤣😁.
.
Toast the chia seed wrap top with cheese, unsalted crunchy peanut and then add sliced banana! Taste good too! 
Try it! 😋😊👍✌💖.
