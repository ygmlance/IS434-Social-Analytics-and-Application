This Labour Day, Clearwater Communications would like to say a big thank you to our courageous frontline heroes, who are working tirelessly to defeat COVID-19. With these virtual gifts, we hope to show our appreciation and gratitude for all that they have done. 
CwC has also made donations to migrant workers in Singapore and Hong Kong who have been negatively impacted by COVID-19. It is not easy having to live away from their loved ones during such tough times and we hope our little contribution can help them.
