Sambal Kicap ULEK / Oelek or some called it the Lava Sauce known for its extreme spiciness and dark colour . This is the one condiment that is sweet, fiery and garlicky paste goes on TOP of anything that need a spicy kick ðŸ˜¬
It will taste more spicy when itâ€™s freshly Ulek , and freezes well too.
You can choose the blender instead but I always love the traditional way of Ulek~ ing the sambal coz I prefer the taste of the freshly crushed chillies that is not too fine . To Ulek is therapeutic by the way .. yeah when you are not in a rush .. ðŸ¥°

Add a dollop of Sambal Kicap Ulek to stir-fries and cook for another minute before plating, use it as a condiment for noodle dishes, grilled meat, fish and tofu, burgers or pizza (donâ€™t knock it â€™til youâ€™ve tried it), or evenÂ substitute it for hot sauce in your favorite chicken wings recipe. Sambal goes where hot sauce goes.
