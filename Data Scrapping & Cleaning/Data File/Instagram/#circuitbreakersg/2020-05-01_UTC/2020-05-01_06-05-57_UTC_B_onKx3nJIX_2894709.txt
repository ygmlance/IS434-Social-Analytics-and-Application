Week 3 and 4: been a rollercoaster ride. With the extension of the circuit breaker midway through week 3. Massive mood dampener. As a small business owner, this circuit breaker has been a huge financial stress. We worry about the company, we worry for our team and their finances. The future is unknown, we know it’s going to be a long uphill battle ahead.... it all seems dark and gloomy and some days it gets a bit too much. During the last 2 weeks I really had to lean in hard with God and really wrestle with Him.  It’s been a process of refining as I learn to surrender to Him daily. 
Tbh all that emotional stress has made me guilty about being stress and worrying that I would affect the little bun’s growth, although thankfully i haven’t had any other indication otherwise. 
Through it all, I am still reminded that there are so many things to be thankful for - a comfortable house, adequate personal finances, a healthy oversized baby 😂, healthy family, good business partners, a loving husband, an easy pregnancy and good friends. “Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint” Isaiah 40:31 
Please reach out if you need someone to chat with. Emotional expressions is not my strength but know that I am always here for you!! #faithoverfear #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #proverbs31ministries #pregnantduringcovid19
