Popping them chilled one at a time in my mouth felt like happy pills, chewy and chocolatey. What a way to start the weekend 🔥 ⁠

Makes - 14⁠
⁠
𝐈𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬:⁠
16 pitted dates*⁠
1.5 scoops @nuzest_singapore rich choc clean lean protein⁠
3tsp cacao powder⁠
6 teaspoons maple syrup⁠
3 tbsp toasted chopped walnuts or peanuts⁠
*soak pitted dates in hot water for 10 mins first⁠
⁠
𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝:⁠
Place all ingredients in a food processor. Pulse until they are well combined.⁠
Roll into teaspoon sized balls or use a cookie scoop.⁠
Roll each protein ball in walnut powder or coconut flakes (optional).⁠
Can be eaten right away or chilled in the refrigerator for 30 minutes first.⁠
1) Protein balls should be slightly sticky. It may look powdery even after blending for awhile, you may use a spoon to press it down to see if it sticks. If they do, you are ready to roll them (trust me they are very chewy). If they are too moist add additional chopped peanuts or protein powder 1/2 teaspoon at a time until right the balls are the right texture. If the protein balls are to dry and falling apart add another date.⁠
