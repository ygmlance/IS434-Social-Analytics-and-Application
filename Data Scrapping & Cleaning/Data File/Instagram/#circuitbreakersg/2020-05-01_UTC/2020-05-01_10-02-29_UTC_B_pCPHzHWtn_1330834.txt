Braised Sea Cucumber & Fish Maw Pot - my most satisfied iso experiment to date.
.
Happened to come across some sea cucumber. Was apprehensive about cleaning them though. After much squirming & lots of hot water, itâ€™s into the pot with the rest of the ingredients. Honestly, I miss fine dining without having to do the dishes!
.
Side note - My new find @kansomaustralia abalone sauce proved to be a gem! Their customer service was fantastic too, with many shops closed, they hunted down a bottle for me!
