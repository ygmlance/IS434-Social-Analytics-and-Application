Dinner this evening was Sambal Fried Rice, which had onions , minced garlic, minced pork, eggs, chopped Chye Sim, or Mustard Greens, and was seasoned with fish sauce, superior light soya sauce and Chiu Chow Chilli Oil. This was accompanied by a side of Blanched Spinach with a superior light soya sauce dressing and topped with fried shallots and whitebait. Tasty and satisfying! And as it is International Sauvignon Day, i had a 2017 Movida, Sauvignon from Brda in Slovenia. ðŸ˜‹ #sambalfriedrice #blanchedspinach #friedriceparadise #stayathome #eatathome #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg #movidawine #sauvignon #sauvignonblancday #brda #slovenianwine #wineofslovenia #thewinedistributioncompany
