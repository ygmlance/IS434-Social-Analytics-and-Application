Happy Labour Day to All, Especially the Frontline Workers! 💖⠀
⠀
Thank you for your dedication. Thank you for your commitment. Thank you for your contributions. ⠀

Thank you again for all the extra hours you worked to keeping us safe. Thank you for all the sacrifices you’ve made for our protection 🙏🏼 ⠀

President Halimah Yacob mentioned in her May Day message on Facebook yesterday, and it moved me deeply 🥺 ⠀
⠀
“This outbreak has also brought out the very best in our workers. Our frontline workers work tirelessly despite the hazards to their own lives. Many workers across a vast array of industries continue to work behind the scenes in essential roles to keep our nation in motion. Other workers are innovating and designing new ways to help one another, the less fortunate and the needy, so that we can pull out of this crisis stronger. These are all incredibly selfless acts in the face of great risks, and we should not take their contributions for granted.“⠀
⠀
These are unprecedented and trying times we’ve been facing and we don’t know how long it will remain. However, let’s remain strong, keep our spirits up and continue to abide by the circuit breaker measures. Together we will overcome my friends! 💪🏼⠀
