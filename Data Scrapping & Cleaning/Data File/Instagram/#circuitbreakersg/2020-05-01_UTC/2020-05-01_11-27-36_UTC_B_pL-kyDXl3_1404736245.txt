Disclaimer: no slide was damaged while undertaking this fun-filled, colour-infused activity ðŸ˜…. I look rather awkward coming out of that slide, because - the hell I was! It was in the #Umbria region of #Italy, right outside an outlet mall, where I ditched those delicious #Italian brands for some slide-induced-vertigo. I did overcome some irrational fear of heights that day, and gained newfound respect for my young brood. Now that life has become a tad slow, I found the time to realise how #fun this little moment was, and how easily it was forgotten in pursuit of the next great #gelato. Thanks for this Shivin & Ruhan, onto Skydiving next, I promise ðŸ˜¬. #Italy #Umbria #lockdown #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #playgrounds #slide #tunnelslide #kids
