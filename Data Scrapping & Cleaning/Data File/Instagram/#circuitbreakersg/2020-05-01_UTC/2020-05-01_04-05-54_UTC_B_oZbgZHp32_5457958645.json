The fillings usually consisted of boiled eggs, sliced tomatoes, tuna and definitely an enormous serving of my Mum's love! \u2764\ufe0f I also remembered my Mum teaching me how to use the pop-up bread toaster and I simply enjoyed pressing down the lever on the side to activate it. And I would also eagerly wait for the popping sound when the latch was released so that I could \"catch\" the bread slice popping up from the slot. It was pure joy for a simple kid like me. And my action unfailingly also brought a broad smile on my Mum's face. Thinking back, our sweet moments together made my bread tastier and the feeling of my Mum's love for me a shade warmer! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nLet me also share my utmost pride for my MA-rvellous Mum via this self-penned ode to her:\n\nYour love, I don't have to queue\nYour concern, always right on cue\nYour patience unfailingly clears my issue\nYour knowledge infallibly is my rescue\nYour strength, a lifetime goal I pursue\nYou've turned my life into the sweetest fondue! \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f I love you, Mum.
