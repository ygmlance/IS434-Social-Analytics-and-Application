#CircuitBreakerSg Day 25! Tonight’s dinner theme was “zichar at home”! Whip up 2 common zichar dishes for the family - Pork ribs king (#paikuwang) with fried egg and Chinese spinach with 3 eggs in superior stock. The pork ribs didn’t turn out very well though looks legit! #照骗 I will share the recipe when I get it right. 😅
