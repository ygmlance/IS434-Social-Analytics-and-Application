1 MAY 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 25

Day 25 - #circuitbreakersg 
Labour Day = Working Day
👷‍♀️👷‍♂️
Though it is a public holiday, it does not seems to make much difference now as it is either a working day or rest day
🌧
Exempted from cooking at home but still have cooking duties at work. Cooked a decent pot or chicken wings today. Need to plan what to cook tomorrow.
