Thanks to the circuit breaker, I started my baking journey ,and the best part is, I do it together with my boys.They have been a great help! We have been doing a 30 mins cooking /baking lesson for the past 3 days .We learn and bake and have fun together ! (Truth : Super messy😅)
Well ,Many first for mama here coz I can’t bake😅
Decided to try pandan chiffon cake today with Korkor! But we will try bake it with the rice cooker coz I’m not so confident using the oven 🤪 
Yay ! 成功! My 老大 say good!
Happy mummy😊
