Day 25 of circuit breaker -

Did another kicked-ass session of HIIT class today!

It's been really fun working out together & keeping fit while staying home 💪😁 And loving the energy from everyone behind the screens!

Shower, sweat, shower and repeat! That pretty much sums up my day today!

Stay healthy and happy everyone 💪🤗😁 #focuspilates #focussg #focusmovement #onlinepilates #virtualworkout #virtualpilates #wfh #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #pilates #cardio #hiit #behindthescenes
