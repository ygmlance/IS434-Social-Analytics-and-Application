Outside Thunder roars and Lightning strikes but the nicest thing about the rain is that it always stops. Eventually.

Indoors Iâ€™m whipping up a meal nickname by the family as â€˜The Stressful Dinnerâ€™. Why?  Because this is one dish that cannot be eaten together, I insist they must eat it the minute I get the noodles out to themðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†. â€˜Take, Go!!â€™

Love the Emerald noodles by @handpicked.sg. Homemade juicy Wantons and Char Siew that have been sitting in a beautiful marinate since yesterday night and roasted in the oven till char Siew perfection.
.
Letâ€™s eat!
