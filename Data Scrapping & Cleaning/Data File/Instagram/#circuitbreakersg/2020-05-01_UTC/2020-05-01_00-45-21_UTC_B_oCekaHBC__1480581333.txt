I donâ€™t run. Never had the stamina nor the mental strength. In my mind though I was a graceful long distance runner with long strong strides ðŸ˜Œ
I will now chalk another personal achievement during the time of #covid19 and #circuitbreakersg
I found the mental strength to go for a run every morning. Itâ€™s been 2 weeks. Surprisingly I donâ€™t hear the music through my iPod only my heartbeat, my ragged breathing and my footsteps. Nothing else exists, just me.
