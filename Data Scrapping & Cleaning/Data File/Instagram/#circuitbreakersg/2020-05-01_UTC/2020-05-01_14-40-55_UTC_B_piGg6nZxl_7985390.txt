Family. Work. Self. I used to want to divide my time equally across these three major parts of my life. But balanced priorities is not abt dividing your time equally for each part. 
Then what is it? For me, having balanced priorities is about being present in each part - family, work, self. It’s knowing what matters in each part that you chose. 
Especially during this circuit breaker. I hv to admit that I haven’t been very present in my work or self. A lot went into keeping routines at home and getting the children settled into a new routine during the home based learning. And next Tuesday is the start of their May school holidays for a month. Again, I don’t know how things will pan out. 
But I am definitely putting in more effort in keeping my priorities closer to heart. It’s not abt doing it perfectly. It’s really abt bng present when I choose to commit to my priorities. .
