A big shoutout to my wonderful parents. They are everything to me. Some say families are like branches of a tree, we run in different directions but our roots remain as one. ⁣⁣

My mom is caring to the point that sometimes I want to run away 😝 but I still love her very much. My dad is the smart one, he keeps quiet and smiles. When there are differences at home, which there will be, I remember that I am my father, and I am my mother. ⁣⁣

Learn to understand and accept the father and mother inside of us first. Understand that mom will always be caring and that made me the doctor I am today. But be diplomatic like dad and just smile. Everything will be ok 🥰 ⁣Love wins. ⁣
