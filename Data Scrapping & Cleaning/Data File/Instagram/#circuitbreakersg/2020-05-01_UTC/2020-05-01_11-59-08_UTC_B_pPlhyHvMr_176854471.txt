Hotpot is the perfect meal to go for on this cool and wet evening.  Something different from our usual, this pot is filled with leaves, lotsa of leaves. 
They name it Mille-Feuille Nabe or Thousand Leaves Hotpot.  Layers of nappa cabbage and pork belly slices are neatly arranged in the pot & cooked in a savory dashi broth.

We made our own dipping sauce using chopped chill padi, minced garlic, chopped spring onions, light soya sauce & lemon juice.

You have no excuse not to take your greens in this meal!!😁 Have a great evening folks!
