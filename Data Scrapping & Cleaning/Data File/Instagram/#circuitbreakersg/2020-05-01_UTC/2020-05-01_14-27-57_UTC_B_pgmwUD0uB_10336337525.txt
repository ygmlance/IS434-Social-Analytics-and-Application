Day 24 of CB: I can't say I love this Circuit Breaker but I gotta say, this Circuit breaker brought my family & @shpwrkd @codecaud closer to my life. Meeting @amandakeee online again & many other friends who spoke to me this season. 
Quality time with friends are being taken away during our day to day schedules, it is replaced with activities or games or other recreational activities. When was the last time that you had a proper conversation with a friend? 
I took this time to give a couple of my friends a call and thank you for sending me your love virtually! 💕 Especially @marlen3toh @itsleonmarkcus

Take this time to sit down and have a conversation this week. You'll be surprise, sometimes they add some life, love & light with you.
