Day24 of #circuitbreakersg : MISSED TIMEZONE 😴 🐝 This yellow bee “The CONFIDENT GIRL” I’ve known to myself, so important to hold a attitude with Kindness and Love to conquer the hearts 💕. Happy and grateful to be occupied with extreme work in no time to cook or eat lunch soulfully, yesterday I was like a Super human attending back to back meetings and cooking in between during the lunchtime to feed me and my family. Felt like having 10 hands and was flying around. Who else felt the same during this #lockdown like #superwoman 💪🏻? Comment below.... 🦋
