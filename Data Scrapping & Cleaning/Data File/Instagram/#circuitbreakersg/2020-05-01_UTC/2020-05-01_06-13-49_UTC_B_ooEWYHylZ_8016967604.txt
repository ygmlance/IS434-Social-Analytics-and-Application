#covid19 lockdown blues are sinking in OMG.  Here’s a colourful picture to brighten up your day.  Anyone else needs some colours in their life? 
#stuckathome everyday from this #circuitbreakersg has made my emotions more turbulent than pre-covid19 and the kids are also reeling in the heat.  Some days I feel like I’m becoming a crappier mum yet some days I feel like I’ve got this covered.  The good days seem less good and the bad days seem badder, if badder is even a word to begin with. 
More often than not, I threw away whatever gentle parenting methods I’ve preached and resorted to shouting, wielding the cane and smacking.  Because, honestly, a loud voice gets an immediate reaction from the kids!  My perpetual cheery face often show shadows of frown and exasperation. 
That being said, the fun also gets more fun as we have more time to play around with silliness and discover interesting stuff.  They cry hard from the restrictions but they also play hard when it’s play time.  At the end of the day when we chat in bed, when I cuddle them and they fall asleep right next to me, they revert back to being sweet little angels and this helps reset whatever negative feelings accumulated in the day.  How do you reset your feelings?

You see my face last time and my face now, confirm can notice the stark difference.  Boohoo.  Hope everyone’s holding up okay.  Not expecting a shoutout of “fantastic”, but do stay afloat and keep the spirits up!
