I guess most of us purchase whole Salmon because of economic reasons. What do you do with the bones other than making soup?

Often there's quite a bit of meat on the bones and you can actually make another dish out of it. I like to season the bones with Salt, Pepper & Garlic Powder. Drizzle some Olive Oil and pop them into the air-fryer for a couple of mins. Once it's cooked, flake the meat using a fork making sure bones are removed. That's it, you can use this for fried rice, sushi, salad and even sandwich. #zerofoodwastage

Brunch was Avocado Salmon Sandwich served with mixed Greens & must-have #Coffee. Anyone?
