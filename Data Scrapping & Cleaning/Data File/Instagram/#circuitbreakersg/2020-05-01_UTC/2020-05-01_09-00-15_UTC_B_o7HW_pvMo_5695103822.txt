What to do during circuit period? Time to try out the souvenir get from our Japan-Kansai trip. First saw this matcha drink and put this to my basket within a second ðŸ¤£ matcha lover is like that! First time trying a sachet together with Farmhouse fresh milk. It totally taste like the matcha latte we used to drink from Starbucks. What I am sure is the 6 sachets in a packet is definitely cheaper! Worth to try exspecially the powder is not the sweet type!
