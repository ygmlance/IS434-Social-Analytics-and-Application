Circuit Breaker Edition- 📍: Yun Ga Singapore. ⭐️: 5/5  Since many years ago, my family and I have been frequent customers at their restaurant at Katong. Not only do we enjoy their quality food, their service and hospitality were top notch as well. When the circuit breaker kicked in, korean cuisine definitely was something we craved for. Yun Ga was just a text away whenever we wanted to order and we have since ordered from them 4 times during the one month circuit breaker. Definitely go for their bossam (steamed pork belly), jokbal (sliced cold pork trotter), korean fried chicken and additional banchan (side dishes: their homemade kimchi are a gem to keep to make kimchi fried rice/soup) 😋 they also have special promotions where they give a free dish and free delivery (>$70 orders)! You can Whatsapp them at 92280101 to order.
