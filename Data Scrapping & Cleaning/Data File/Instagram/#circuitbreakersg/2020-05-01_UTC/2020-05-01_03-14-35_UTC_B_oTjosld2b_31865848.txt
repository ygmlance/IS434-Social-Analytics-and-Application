During this #wfh (sure... “working”...) period, i caught up with a couple of movies that I missed during their theatre screenings. I had been watching at least one movie a day, also catching up on those that I might had overlooked. 
Watched The Good Liar, I love the on screen pairing of Mirren and McKeller. 
I am not going to dwell on the plot because it contained a major plot twist. 
What I did, I paused parts of the movie to do some quick sketches, some of drawing exercises I do over the years.
Next on my list: Portrait of a Lady On Fire.
Any recommendations for movies/documentaries I should check out?
Big thank you in advance and remember to wear your mask! 😷💪🏼
