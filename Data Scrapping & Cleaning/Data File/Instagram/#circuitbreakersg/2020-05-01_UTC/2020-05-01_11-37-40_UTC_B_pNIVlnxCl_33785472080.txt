Concha y Toro Don Melchor 1996

Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to get my filthy drunken hands on a couple of these mature Don Melchor which drank brilliantly. God knows why I got them ... I must have been piss drunk that day. But whoa... this was drinking at absolute peak. Great balance and finesse. Getting drunk always has happy endingsðŸ¤ª. I havenâ€™t had much of the modern Chilean cabs which seem more commercialised. Hopefully they are at least half as good as this!
