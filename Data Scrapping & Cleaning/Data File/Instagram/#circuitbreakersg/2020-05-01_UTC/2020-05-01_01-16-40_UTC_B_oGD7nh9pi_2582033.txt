What? Cockles again? Naah .. these were served 2 days before we had Char Kway Teow , coz Char Kway Teow was the meal from left over cockles here ðŸ˜¬. Left over cockles were frozen , and given 2 days break before giving it a fresh look on the dining table . Repurposing dishes in unexpected ways saves trips to the grocery store and time in the kitchen.

1.Cockles in lemon grass broth 
2.Pan Grilled Hard Tail Scad(Cencaru Bakar)
3.Anchovies with Stink Bean (Bilis Petai)
4.Spicy Soy Sauce ( Kicap Chili Padi) 
5.Fresh Basils (Ulam Daun Selasih)

Makanan macam ni will make the non rice eater like me - RAJIN makan sampai 2 pinggan ðŸ˜¬

Iftar ideas for the weekend guys !
