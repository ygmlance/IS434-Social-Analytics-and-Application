No great achievement is possible without persistent labour, same goes for your #fitnessgoals 
Happy Labour Day everyone, and a special thank you shoutout to our healthcare professionals and frontline friends who are labouring through this long weekend to care for patients and delivering essential goods and services to us during this circuit breaker period! ❤️❤️
