May the #music never stop, and may it always be good ðŸ˜Š....not just figuratively ðŸ˜¬... and especially so in your teenage years ðŸ˜…. Original composition by Shivin and Ruhan: Shooting Star. 
Ruhan can perform, without being asked. And he did...the whole day... on this two-word song. It was noisy, and sometimes I wished for a volume control button for him, but when that feeling passed, I realised that he was giving his #lockdown best. That he is doing so well, although it's tough for his little 2yo self to understand why he suddenly cannot step out, meet friends and breathe freely without a mask. I truly enjoyed his (day-long) performance then, and loved that he was trying to sing and perform like a #rockstar ðŸ—£ðŸ•ºðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¸! #dance #songwriter #songlyrics #songoftheday #song #guitar #performer #entertainer #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #ShivInDaHouse #Ruhanster
