Happy labour day and welcome to the second month of the circuit breaker!😷
.
While being stuck at home can bring about a different kind of stress and adaptation, we are glad to still see surprised smiles on your faces when we deliver during this period!😊
.
Many of you have been ordering our kombucha as gifts for your loved ones during this period, and we are happy to pass along the positive notes and well wishes, so keep them coming!❤️
.
Order before 8pm and we will send your thoughts, and gut healthy kombucha on the same day to help your loved ones get through this together! 💪🏻💪🏻
