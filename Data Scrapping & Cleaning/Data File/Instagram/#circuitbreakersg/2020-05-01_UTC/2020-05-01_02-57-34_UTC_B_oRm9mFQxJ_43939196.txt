My heart goes out to our little heroes at home, who try to keep their smiles and head up in this really strange time. No school. No playgrounds. No swimming or cycling. Must wear mask and don’t you dare touch anything. Assortments of sanitizers and a whole lot of kanchiong-spider behaviours. And in his little mind grasping the idea of a world full of virus. So this lil one here smiling is my hero #sheikhjuz ❤️ how’s your little ones doing? #circuitbreakersg
