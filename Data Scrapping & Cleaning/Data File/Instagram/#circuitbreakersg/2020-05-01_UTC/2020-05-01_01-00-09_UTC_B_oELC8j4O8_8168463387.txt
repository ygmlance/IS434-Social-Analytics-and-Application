ðŸ“¢A shoutout to the sanitation workers, delivery drivers, F&B staff, medical workers and YOU. This is for everyone working doubly hard to ensure life remains as unchanged and comfortable as possible. â€¢
We're all working hard one way or another and deserve a breather, if only just for a dayðŸ¤™ â€¢
Whether you're hopping on a trainer, running loops around the neighbourhood or doing a million push-ups why not dedicate it to someone you'd like to show appreciation to and tag us tooðŸ¤³
