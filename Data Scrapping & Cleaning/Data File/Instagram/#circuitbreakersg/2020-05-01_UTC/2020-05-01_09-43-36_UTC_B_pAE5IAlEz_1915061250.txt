Happy Labour Day! 
While it is usually a day to memorialize the achievements of workers, we want to give an extra shout out to all frontline and essential workers who had been a strong support system for all of us in these difficult times.

From the doctors, nurses, healthcareworkers, to the cleaners and delivery riders, a big round of applause to all of you.

Thank you for risking your lives everyday to ensure the rest of us are safe at home.  United we stand for and by each other!
