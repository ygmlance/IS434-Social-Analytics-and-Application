Labour day Leftover Laksa Lunch!
.
Bits of here and there morphing into a simple meal with no frills.
.
Tofu Puff, Fish Cake, noodles and Laksa paste I saved in the freezer. Of course I checked everything was still edible üòÅ. Prettified it with Spring Onions and Crispy Anchovy Chilli.
.
In January when my old fridge died and we had to get a new one, little did I know I would need the space and chilling options as I do in these #Covid19 times - I guess things always happen for a reason.
