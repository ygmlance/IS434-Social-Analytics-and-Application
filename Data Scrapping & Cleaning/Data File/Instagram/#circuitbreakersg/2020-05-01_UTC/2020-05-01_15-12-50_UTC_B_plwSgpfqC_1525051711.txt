#quarantips 7 things that #covid19 has taught me so far...and it's my #selfmusing💫  #originalcontent 🤘
.
💛 You are allowed to PLAN but don't expect that EVERYTHING will happen according to it.
.
❤️ HOME is where YOUR HEART should be and BODY too. #stayhomeforsg
.
💚 Comfort Zones need to SHATTERED and you should be ready to change its definition.
.
💜 Come out of your superficial WORLD and LOOK around. There's so much that you have no idea about.
.
💙 Take EACH day at a time and BE GRATEFUL for what you have.
.
🧡 You can live without shopping, junk eating and travelling but NOT without good health. #safehands
.
🤍 Pressing Pause and Reset button is NOT just for gadgets. It's for US too.

Talking about good health and personal hygiene, I guess am going to continue some good habits even after #coronatime  is over... like wearing mask religiously when unwell, cleansing hands regularly with good hand sanitizer like this P+US2 with Tea Tree Oil and Chia Seed Oil for Moisturizing...
