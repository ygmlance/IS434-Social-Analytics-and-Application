So, so many gorgeous views of sakura..! Went with this because I could picture the cast of Pandora's Scar chilling under the blossoms while watching that amusing activity humans call 'boating' ;D --------------- Destination 2: Nara Deer Park. Nara, Japan

It took a few tries to get a shot with both the deer and the surroundings. Bonus inclusion of a Deer senbei cracker stall on the left! ----------------
Bonus Destination: Kasuga-Taisha Shrine. Nara Japan

I really wanted a shot of the deer against traditional Japanese building, so when I saw this I had to include it ;) #sgcomics #virtualbackground #StayhomeforSG #labourday
