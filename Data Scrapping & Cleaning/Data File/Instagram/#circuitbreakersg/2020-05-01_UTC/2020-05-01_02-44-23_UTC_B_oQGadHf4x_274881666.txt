Mystery Thursdays II
Theme: Eggs & Things 🍳
Budget: ~$50 (for 2 pax)

Bai Nian is one of my fave #YTF chains. It provides a reliable bowl of YTF goodness when we’re too lazy to queue at #Shunliyongtaufoo or #Luckyplazayongtaufoo.

Thanks P for the “robust” lunch and left us to play with the missing egg(s) puzzle 😝
