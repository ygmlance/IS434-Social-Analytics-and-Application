Stepping into 2020, who knew we would face a pandemic and enter a new norm. As we face uncertain times, I’ve been fortunate enough to adapt easily to this new way of life.

Most mornings, I just do an ordinary home workout but today, I wanted to try something new by incorporating Chilli in my workout since she’s always lurking around. I wasn’t holding her the right way in the first video and by the second video (check her original post for the other video!), she was so over it. She probably wants us out of the house already.

How have you been #EmbracingNewNorms to stay active? Take on the AIA #EmbracingNewNorms Challenge and stand to win $50 worth of shopping vouchers. Visit bit.ly/AIAEmbracingNewNorms for more details.
