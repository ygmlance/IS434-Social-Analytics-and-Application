Having fried rice for brunch while watching TV.

Happened to be seeing @dasmondkoh and @kym_ng on @ch8sg. OMG my 8-year-old got so excited! Her favourite TV show is "百倍" (The Sheng Siong Show) and they are her superstar idols. She misses them so much since she doesn't get to watch her "百倍" on Channel 8 these days. Earlier in January, while watching the CNY variety show on Channel 8, she was totally swooning when they appeared... whole night telling me "振荣很帅!" and "钟琴很美!" non stop.

Happy Labour Day everyone! 🏠 Stay home, stay safe!
