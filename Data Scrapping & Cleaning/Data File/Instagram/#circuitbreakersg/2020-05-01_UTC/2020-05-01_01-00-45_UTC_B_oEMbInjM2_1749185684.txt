See Saw Row
Happy May Day! 
Decided to try 45min HIIT Tabata Workout with weights, not the usual style.. They repeat 4 sets of the exercise - 20 secs on 10 secs off. And longer workout here includes warm up and cool down which I'm always lazy to do.. Also did #heatherroberstoncom 5 min plank challenge at the end... There is so many choices...but always choose what u r comfortable with? (realised my workout wear is erm.... Loose.. Hope that's a good sign! The weighing machine also tell me otherwise! Argh..) No need to rush for work... But need to touch base with some parents today.... #prepforschoolholiday 
Have a great day to #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
