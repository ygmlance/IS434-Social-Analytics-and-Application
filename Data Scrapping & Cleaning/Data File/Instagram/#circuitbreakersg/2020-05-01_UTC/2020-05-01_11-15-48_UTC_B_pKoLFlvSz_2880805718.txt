Beers from @thegeneralbrewingco 🇸🇬🍺
⁣
𝗟𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲 Neo-Classic Pilsner: "Gulps clean and crisp with a grainy backbone that complements its subtle floral hoppiness." Can't add much more to that official description other than the fact that this was an extremely enjoyable quaff.
⁣
𝗗𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗼𝗻 𝗪𝗲𝗹𝗹 Long Jin Tea Pilsner: "Drinks clean with gentle floral nuances, chestnuts and tea roast." First time I'm trying a beer brewed with tea and I must say I'm sold - a marriage between two of my favourite beverages can only be a good thing.

Acquired from @templecellars, great beers like these from a local craft brewery makes this circuit breaker that much easier to bear! ⁣
