What do you want to be when you grow up?
.â€¨Some parents like to ask this but some shun away because what we want to be will change as we grow up. 
No matter what a child wants to be, health is the greatest thing we need to maintain in tip top condition in order to fulfil that dream.
.
I have fussy eaters and in order to be sure their growth and development are in tip top condition, I supplement them with StrongImmune Kids from @usc_strongkids.
.
They have other supplements as well. Do check them out at @usc_strongkids.
