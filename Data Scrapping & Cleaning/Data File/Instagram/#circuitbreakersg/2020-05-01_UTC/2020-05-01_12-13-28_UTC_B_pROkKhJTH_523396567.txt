Is it Worth to Downsize to be Mortgage Free? 🤔⠀
⠀
"Why must sell off our beautiful fully renovated 5-RM flat? Why not just stay and pay off our housing loan until finish?"⠀
⠀
For most of us, we get attached to our houses and once we do, it's very difficult for us to let go of it. Especially so, when we have spent thousands of dollars on renovation into making it our home.⠀
⠀
Let me share with you some of the answers.⠀
⠀
You don't want to be working until 60 years old just to pay off your housing loan. There's a high chance once you turn 55, you may not be able to use 100% of CPF to service your housing loan due to CPF Retirement Account rules and regulations. You wouldn't want to fall into the trap, like most Singaporeans do, where they work until they die just to service the housing loan 😱⠀
⠀
I would advice my clients (especially the older generation) to make the right choice by exiting before it's too late. It is important to see the bigger picture where their mental and physical health are much more important than slogging it out working day in day out, to finish paying their housing loans. ⠀
⠀
The answer to your financial burden may be to simply downsize your home 👍🏼⠀
⠀
And if you buy a cheaper property than the one you sold, that extra cash can go a long way to helping you enjoy life in your new home! 😃⠀
⠀
However it also depends on a case-by-case basis. So give me a call, I'll run the numbers for you and prepare your home for a favourable evaluation! 💪🏼⠀
⠀
Stay safe, stay healthy and stay home everybody 🙆🏻‍♂️⠀
