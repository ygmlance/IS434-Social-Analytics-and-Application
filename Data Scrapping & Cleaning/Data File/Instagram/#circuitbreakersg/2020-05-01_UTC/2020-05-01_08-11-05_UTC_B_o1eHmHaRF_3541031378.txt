Made myself a nice glass of hot honey lemon tea for a lazy afternoon. CB really makes everything quieter, and I kind of enjoy the silence and slower pace. There's something super hypnotic about just watching smoke rise and fly away from the piping hot glass. I could sit and stare blankly and just watch the smoke goes by... #cbday25 #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #silence #quiet #calm #lazyafternoon #honey #lemon #smoke #mood
