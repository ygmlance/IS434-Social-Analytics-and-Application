In view of the Circuit Breaker period, many of our vehicles will be parked for prolonged period. 
Here is our Car Care Tip to help care for your beloved vehicle!

#1 Park your Vehicle Safely in a Sheltered Spot or Cover it Up

As you will not be using the vehicle for a long duration, it is recommended to park your vehicle in a covered area to protect your vehicle from exposure to sunlight and bird poops. If not, you can cover your car with a vehicle cover which will also help to prevent collection of leaves.
