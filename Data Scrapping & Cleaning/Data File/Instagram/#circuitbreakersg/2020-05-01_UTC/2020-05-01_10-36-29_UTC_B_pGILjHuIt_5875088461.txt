As we celebrate Labour Day 2020, the groups of people that are at the forefront of our minds would be the frontliners as well as the migrant workers who have worked hard to make Singapore a better place. .
.
Today we come together in solidarity to celebrate the achievements of these workers who have sacrificed and contributed so much for the growth of Singapore. .
.
During this Circuit Breaker, we are also grateful people who are in essential services who kept Singapore going. Thank you for keeping Singapore safe during this period.
.
.
Together, we can brave through this pandemic and come out stronger as a nation. Together, we can build a better future for our children to live in. Together, we can do anything. .
.
Happy May Day everybody! . .
