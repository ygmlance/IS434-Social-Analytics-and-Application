Threw a cheeky star into the side bend twist. Don’t think my students expected it! 😝 Ended Week 3 of #Pilates4Fund on a high note, with the biggest turnout and funds raised: 120 @secondmeal.io meals for cab/private hire car drivers, some of the hardest hit groups by the COVID-19 crisis. Next week, we are supporting @ssvpsingapore in continuing their mission to tackle poverty in all forms. PM me if you are keen to find out more. #circuitbreakersg #stottpilates #stottpilatesinstructor #pilatessidebend #coreforacause
