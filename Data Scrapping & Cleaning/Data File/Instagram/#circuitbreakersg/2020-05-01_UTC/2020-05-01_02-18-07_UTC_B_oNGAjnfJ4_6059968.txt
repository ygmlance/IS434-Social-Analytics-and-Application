Kids Lunch Menu: Tomato Noodle

Days ago, I ordered wantan noodles delivery for the family. They were really, really good and so I'm once again, inspired to replicate the tomato flavour version in my own kitchen. But no wanton here as the kids were too hungry to wait any longer so I made the minced meat version. Used lots of fresh tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. To create healthier flavours, I only used 3 ingredients : @liloikanbilis mushroom powder, some salt and homemade apple sauce. They work magic together. Check out my IGTV tomorrow morning for apple sauce video tutorial :) Happy Labour Day! Take a break from the kitchen and order some food from our local hawkersðŸ˜‰
