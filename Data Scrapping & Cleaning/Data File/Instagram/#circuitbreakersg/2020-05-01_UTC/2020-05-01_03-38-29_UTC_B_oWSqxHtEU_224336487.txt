And just like that we are in May. 4 weeks of being in Circuit Breaker, what did you achieve?

Some of us @thehighpanterssg took on a 100KM challenge and it was a journey of true inspiration for me and for many others. Each day as the leader board was being updated and the team was sharing their runs on IG, each day I found new motivation.

The best part was being able to motivate each other in our WhatsApp group and cheering each other on. The human body is truly a machine as we saw some of our guys hitting insane mileage of way past the 100KM goal. 
To the peeps that didn't hit the 100KM, it doesnt even matter. The fact that you joined us and ran already means something.

I also wanted to do a special shoutout to all our new friends that joined this challenge with us, those that dm-ed to be part of it. We can't wait to welcome you to our @thehighpanterssg runs when we can meet to run again.

Stay tuned for May's #TheHighPanters Challenge, we should be announcing it today.

Till we run again, together. XOXO
