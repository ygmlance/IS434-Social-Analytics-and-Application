It's an Oriental affair on a rainy Friday. I made a pot of braised stuff including eggs, meat and mushroom to pair with sweet potato porridge. It's lighter in colour than usual because I skipped both dark,  light soya sauce and sugar to make it toddler-friendly. In replacement, I added in more spices (star anise, cardamon pods, cinnamon sticks & cloves). It's so fragrant and a good balance between the sweetness of the porridge and the savory of the braised stuff. The Simlets slurped it all up. #simletseat #homemadefood #sghomecook #toddlerfood #healthykidsfood #instafood #sweetpotato #braised #sgmummy #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomestaysafe
