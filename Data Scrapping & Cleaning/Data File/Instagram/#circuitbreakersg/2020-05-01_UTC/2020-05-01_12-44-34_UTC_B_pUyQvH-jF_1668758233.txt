In all seriousness, many of us kinda wish today wouldÂ literally be "Labor-Day".
How we miss the feeling of being in a workspace, face to face meetings and getting stuff done, and the adrenaline of meeting deadlines.
.
It's been about a month since the CB started. With unemployment rates in Singapore skyrocketing, the first day of May brings an ironic sense of dread and uncertainty about the future. We've seen plenty of good, hardworking people suddenly unemployed, sent home and it honestly breaks our hearts.
.
So if you're able, we're directing your attention to visit Giving.sg ( @giving.sg ) where you can put money directly to the growing number of people who are in need today. While we've considered food donations, we find that having access to actual cash makes for the most effective support.
.
For the team at Fresher, we count ourselves blessed and grateful to be able to continue serving in a time like this - because YOU kept our little homegrown business - one that we and the team have committed a lot to - going and growing.
.
So this Labour Day, let's make an effort to do something, because together we can overcome this situation.
