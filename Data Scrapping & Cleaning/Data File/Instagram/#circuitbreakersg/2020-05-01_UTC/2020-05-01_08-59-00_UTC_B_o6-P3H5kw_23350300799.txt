There is an old saying - “We make our friends; we make our enemies; but God makes our next door neighbour.”
.
And we’ve been blessed with one of the best ones. The Lims made us hae mee for lunch today (not the first time), we can tumpang packages in the event we’re not home, little knick knacks and toys for my kids while they run amok in their home ransacking for snacks.
.
This pandemic has truly brought out the best in us; the community spirit has never been higher; we’re witnessing so many acts of kindness emerge every day. I hope when we come out of this, we’ll remember to extend this very same compassion.

Oh yah, to return the favour, I baked up some double choc chip macadamia cookies. ☺️
