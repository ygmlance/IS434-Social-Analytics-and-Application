Day 24.  A gray sky is quite common lately. Brunch - Japanese ginger pork, poached egg, multi grain rice. Stir fried Broccoli spears with Jap fried tofu. Nom munched on his portion of coriander while watching a cook show w me. ðŸ¤£ The evening sun is really a wonderful sight. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #realfood #homecookedmeal #spendingtimewithfamily #skyisapalette #skyporn #instadaily
