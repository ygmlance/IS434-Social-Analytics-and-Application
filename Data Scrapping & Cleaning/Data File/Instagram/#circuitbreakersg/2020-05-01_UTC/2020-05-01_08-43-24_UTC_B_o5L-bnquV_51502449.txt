Some kind-of Japanese-inspired dish: crispy, crunchy Chicken Karaage on a bed of refreshing Kale & Greek Yogurt salad, with an aromatic side of Snow Peas & Baby Carrots in Ginger Oil. Loved this dish - it creamy yet light, and flavours just blend so well together. Delightful Mayday, indeed! #japanese #inspiration #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
