1. Air fryer crispy chicken chop rice

最近我做了一个这“几年”来一直在挣扎的决定… 我终于斩钉截铁的买了台气炸锅！😱
·
Why No? Because the air fryer will take up space in the kitchen (again)! Why Yes? While the oven is doing a decent job of roasting meats, it’s always a challenge trying to achieve crispy-crunchy skin while keeping meat moist.

I had bought 2 large bags of potato starch from last Taiwan 🇹🇼 trip specially to make these crispy chops. 是的我就是怪咖😙 别人旅行都是买手信… 我不光买手信，还买了一堆的台湾独有的食材回来😂 老公在一旁不停的念叨行李箱快爆了……

The kid said the chicken chop resembled those we had in Taiwan but still, those were better. Ok! For now, we’re good with this! 😅 .
