This is new in #Singapore â€” grocery stores are now taking down your national ID & phone number (in addition to the already standard temperature check) before allowing you in. Supposedly to help with #ContactTracing. This other grocery store I go to here has someone who stands outside & squirts your hands with sanitizer before you enter. #eastcoast #sglife #cb #circuitbreaker #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #farelespese
