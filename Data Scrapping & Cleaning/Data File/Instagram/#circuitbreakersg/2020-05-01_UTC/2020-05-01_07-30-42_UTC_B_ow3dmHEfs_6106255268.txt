During this unprecedented time, while we try our best to assist customers who want to purchase via IG or online, we’d like to also take a backseat, to inspire you and just be in this moment.

We are grateful to have met you at one point or another. At the shop, over IG direct messaging, or when you found us and browse over our IG profile. That we connected naturally and unknowingly, makes us feel that life is more than just a sales transaction.

We’ve always aspired to be a third space to strengthen relationships and be an avenue to remember the people who are dearest to us. When you send a little greeting card to a friend going through a hard time, or surprise your BFF with a gift just because, or expressing your love to the best mum in the world and how much she is appreciated, to a wonderful colleague who is leaving for better prospects abroad, we are delighted by the many stories you tell us. Thank you for sharing those precious moments with us, for allowing us to be part of that journey. We also thank you for your patience.

This drives us forward to do better at what we do. And we will. To better days ahead. We will get through this.

Stay strong, Stay at home. Stay sane.
