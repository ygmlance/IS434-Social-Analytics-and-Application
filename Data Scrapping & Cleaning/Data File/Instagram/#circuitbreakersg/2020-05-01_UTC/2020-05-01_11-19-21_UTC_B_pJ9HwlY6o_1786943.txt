Saw this drink in a cafe previously in Korea, so I thought I'd try to make it and see what it tastes like. Actually not that bad, used freshly squeezed orange juice with some pulp and added some milk and a shot of @nespresso.sg 's Master Origin Ethiopia. 
The orange flavour is really subtle and depending on the orange you used, would probably make the entire drink either sweeter or slightly sourer. Thankfully, the oranges I had were sweet, so there was a nice tangy finish to the coffee!
