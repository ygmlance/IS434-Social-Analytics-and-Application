Last week, my slow juicer from lazada finally came and I  used it today for the first time to juice like 7 carrots. Not wanting to be wasteful I decided to repurpose the pulp into a carrot cake. It was supposed to have a orange cream cheese icing but since I had some lemon curd left over in the fridge from another recipe I used that instead. Was supposed to have walnuts inside and on top too. Went with cashews instead. First time baking a carrot cake and am quite pleased  with the end result. The cake was moist and not overly sweet. (also I baked this in a box toaster)

Will definitely try the recipe again. The next time with the cream cheese icing.
