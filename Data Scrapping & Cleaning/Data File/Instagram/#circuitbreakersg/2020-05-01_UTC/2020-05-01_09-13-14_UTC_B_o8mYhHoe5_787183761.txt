Cooked my favorite fried rice again ❤️👩🏻‍🍳 This time with garlic butter roasted prawns and herb roasted tomatoes 🍅 I ran out of cake flour so it’s time to use my oven for savory dishes instead. I cut tomatoes into quarters, add a little olive oil, seasoned with salt, pepper, dash of sugar, parsley flakes and rosemary :) Cook in the oven at 230C for 15mins :) #friedrice #sghomecook #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakercookingchallenge #ovenroasted #jchencook
