We are craving for a lots of food after a few weeks of circuit breaker (half way to go). Throw back to yesterday having these bowls of Shoyu Ramen from Tsuta during the raining day + pay day! Second time of having this, it is still very yummy for their noodles texture, dip of truffle oil +shoyu soup and of course the amazing egg! Honestly, we ordered this is because of their Buy 1 Free 1 promotion and so it make up the total bill (inclusive of delivery fee)is cheaper than dine in. Satisfying dinner ðŸ˜‹
