[Matcha Croissant + Cappuccino with extra shot] islandwide delivery from @tiongbahrubakery via @grabfoodsg .

Again, I’m enjoying having cafes delivery food to my doorstep. I received many DM asking if I only order 1 coffee a day as the delivery charges wouldn’t make sense. Nope I don’t, I typically order at least 2 cups since my daily intake is 4-5 cups ➕ I save so MUCH more $ drinking cheaper wine at home🍷 ➕the amount saved on Grab fare, shopping and beauty related services is holly substantial! 😆 So I’ll continue to order coffee everyday & support the local cafes & restaurants 🙆🏻‍♀️☕️🥐
