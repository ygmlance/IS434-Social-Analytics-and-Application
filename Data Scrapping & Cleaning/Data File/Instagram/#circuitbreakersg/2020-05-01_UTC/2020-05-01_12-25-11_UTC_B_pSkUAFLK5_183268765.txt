Finally! This is the day which both the kid and parents are looking forward to. No work, just fun! She has been waiting for this moment for the past four work days for us to do something with her.
Wfh doesn't mean free time for many of us. Meetings after meetings and still many datelined to meet. But to our little sweetie pie there is only boredom. She had tried her ways to get our attention and we totally understand. We could only say wait, baby wait. But it's long weekend! Just hope we are able to be with her, accompany her as much as possible before she feels neglected again.
My little precious, papa and mama will always have you in our hearts and mind, we love you so much!
