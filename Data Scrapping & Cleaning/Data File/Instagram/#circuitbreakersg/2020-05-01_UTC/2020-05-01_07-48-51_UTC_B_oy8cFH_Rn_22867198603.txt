We had a fantastic feast the other day. A Belgian spread from @gazette_sg of white asparagus with eggs mimosa, veal tongue, pork pate, steak tartare, Atlantic cod in a creamy fish broth, beef cheek carbonnade, Belgian waffles with chocolate sauce, chocolate mousse and creme brulee.
.
The stand outs were the veal tongue, the cod, beef stew, waffles and creme brulee. My 5 year old daughter loved the Atlantic cod, as did I; definitely my favourite dish of the meal. Both T1 and T3 adored the carbonnade. Of course, no one has told either of them that a carbonnade is beef braised in beer üòÇ.

GaZette is a brand new restaurant on Telok Ayer that opened just before the social distancing measures went into place. It's also just a stone's throw from my office, so I'd been meaning to check it out but never got the chance to. So I'm happy they now do delivery. The food is fresh and delicious. I was especially happy that the veggies in both the beef stew and the cod dish were perfect - not overcooked at all.
.
So, if you're craving some good French / Belgian fare, please give these guys a try.

Have a good long weekend all. Stay safe, stay sane, definitely don't stay sober.‚úåüèºÔ∏è
