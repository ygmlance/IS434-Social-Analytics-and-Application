Isaac’s school project this week was to make a card with a message of appreciation to the migrant worker community in Singapore. Photos of the children making these cards would then be pasted onto a care pack donated by his school to the migrant workers for Labour Day. He chose to colour a very big ‘Take Care’ on his card to all the migrant worker uncles, be it those who are recovering from the virus, those who are isolated from friends and family, or those who are simply facing extremely worrying times while being so far away from their home countries. Hopefully this small gesture from a little boy can put a smile on their faces today.

Happy Labour Day!
