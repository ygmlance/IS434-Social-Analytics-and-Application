Ordered in because too lazy to cook after cooking for almost every meal! Decided to go with @paradisegrpsg Le Shrimp! There's free islandwide delivery for orders above $50, so why not? Hehe. ⁣
⁣
Loved that they separate the soup and noodles for takeaways and deliveries so that the noodles won't go soggy. ⁣
⁣
The Le Shrimp Trio Ramen is a good choice for those who don't know what to get! Drinking the shrimp broth on a cold rainy day is the best! ⁣

📍: You can order via the Paradise Group Oddle page!
