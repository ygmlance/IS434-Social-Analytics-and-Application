ðŸ˜¤.. went out to tabao lunch for the family & Dunno when & how I dropped my Ezlink Charm & I only realised it upon exiting the station. Tried to back track my steps frm the moment I step out of train cabin but the charm wasn't on the floor. It must have dropped in the cabin or if it, at the previous station where I board. By the time I get back to the original station, the charm is nowhere found on the floor. There goes my Tokidoki EzLink charm ðŸ˜”
