It is May!!! We have entered the 2nd month of Circuit Breaker life in Singapore.
I wouldn't say life is a bed of roses now but I think it's not too bad la, with the husband being home a lot more than he used to. I have more adult interaction and hands-on help at home now, these help to keep me sane.
We were down to 6 cases for Singaporeans/PRs yesterday.
Hang in there everyone!!
