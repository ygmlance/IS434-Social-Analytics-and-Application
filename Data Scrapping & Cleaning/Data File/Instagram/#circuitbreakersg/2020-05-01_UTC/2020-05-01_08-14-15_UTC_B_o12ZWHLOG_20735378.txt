Home cooked seafood hor fun by daddy! Extremely delicious with loads of ingredients, like prawns, pork, fish cake and chye sim! In times like these, “circuit breaker” or quarantine, whatever you may call it. It’s a truly a blessing to be home with the folks! Though we may have to understand each other’s differences more and have daily disputes. Majority of the time, we band together because we all love each other dearly! #circuitbreakersg
