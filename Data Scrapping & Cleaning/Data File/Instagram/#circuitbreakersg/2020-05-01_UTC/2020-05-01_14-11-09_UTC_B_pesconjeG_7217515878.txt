49/100: HAPPY LABOUR DAY! 💪

It’s during these challenging times that we find ourselves relying on our postal workers even more📮 They have been delivering letters and parcels across Singapore without fail. Thank you so much!

This illustration is created based on the format of a typical stamp that can be found in Singapore. Important motifs such as our national flower and founding fathers are often featured in the stamp design.

I thought that there’s no better way to celebrate the dedication of our postmen and women than featuring them on a stamp design. ∞ cents for infinite efforts! Hopefully I will get to print this someday with @mysingpost 😆

For Singapore Post #HereWithYou campaign 💌

Let’s continue to celebrate our frontline workers!

P.S. Swipe to see my stamp collection! Who else still collect stamps? 🙋‍♀️
