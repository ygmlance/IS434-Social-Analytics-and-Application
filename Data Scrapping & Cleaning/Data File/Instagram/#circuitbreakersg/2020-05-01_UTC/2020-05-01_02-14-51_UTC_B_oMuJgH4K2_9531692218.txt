No better time to express our gratitude towards the 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️frontliners who are tirelessly fighting & working around the clock to keep us safe in this difficult time. To our frontliners in 🏥healthcare, 🚚our delivery & 🧼cleaning personnels, you are our 𝒖𝒏𝒔𝒖𝒏𝒈 𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒐𝒆𝒔. You’ve made invaluable & immense sacrifice for the nation, being away from loved ones and taking the risk to be in the front line. We 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮 and we 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Tag the frontliners in your life & show some love!❤️
