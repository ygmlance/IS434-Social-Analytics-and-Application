Ignis fatuus imagination 
A glowing, mysterious light that you see at night in a swamp or marsh is an ignis fatuus. An ignis fatuus is caused by a chemical reaction, but it looks ghostly. In modern Latin, ignis fatuus literally means "foolish fire." Previous research has shown that imagining an act can activate and strengthen regions of the brain involved in its real-life execution, improving performance. For instance, imagining playing piano can boost neuronal connections in regions related to the fingers. Research also shows it's possible to update our memories, inserting new details.
The new study suggests that imagination may be a more powerful tool than previously believed for updating those memories.
