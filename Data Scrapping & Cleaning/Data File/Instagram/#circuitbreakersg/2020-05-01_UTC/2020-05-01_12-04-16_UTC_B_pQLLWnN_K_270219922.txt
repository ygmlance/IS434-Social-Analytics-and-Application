1 May 2017 was the first time I met Krystal & coincidentally, had our first date. We hit it off immediately, got married in 2018 & welcomed baby Keira in 2019. How time flies 😅

Unlike previous years, we’re unable to have a date to commemorate our 3 years of courtship due to the Circuit Breaker measures so I’d thought that I’d share a little about my wifey 😳

During this difficult period, learning for all of Krystal’s students transited to Home Based Learning (HBL). Additionally, there were challenges that came up with lesson prep & communication with parents. There wasn’t any immediate contingency plan to rely on per se & uncertainty ensued 🤷🏻‍♂️ In spite of all these, Krystal’s love for teaching & her students shone through ❤️ Even on non-paid days, she continued to plan her lessons & engage the children under her care (She also complained lah let’s be real.) 😜

It’s not easy to be a front liner & there’s tremendous pressure on those in nursing, teaching, food delivery etc. I hope that we realise that they are human too & a bit of kindness will go a long way in keeping their spirits high as they do their best. 
To my wife, keep up the good work & I love you. 
Happy 3 years anniversary !🥰🙌🏻 #sgunited #stayhomesg #singaporetogether #circuitbreakersg
