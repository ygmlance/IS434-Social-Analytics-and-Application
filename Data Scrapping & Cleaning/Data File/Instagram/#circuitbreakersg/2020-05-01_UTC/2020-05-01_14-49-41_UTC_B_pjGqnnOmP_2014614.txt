𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟐𝟓 - #labourdayweekend calls for some celebration, so it’s @nynightmarketsg for #lunch!⁣
⁣
We had:⁣
❣️Baked Garlic Tortilla⁣
❣️Sleepless in Nacho⁣
❣️Tianjin Jjamppong⁣
❣️Hot Bacon Chicken ⁣
❣️Shrimp Volcano Rice ⁣
⁣
A pity their sandwiches are not available for delivery, if not, I would have ordered that. Other than that, all’s good! I like how the toppings and sauces for the nachos are packed separately. Likewise for the Hot Bacon Chicken. Added some nachos toppings to the chicken~ ⁣
⁣
Like all its sister brands, minimum order for delivery is $30 with $8/$12 islandwide delivery fee. Opt for self pickup & get 10% off your order ($50 & above). Check out their page for more deets! ⁣
