Virtual SWEAT (HIIT) classes are designed to build fitness through a variety of high intensity intervals and circuit training using your bodyweight or weights that can be found at home (backpacks, books, water bottles). These exercises can be regressed or progressed in order to suit different fitness levels.

This class will tone up your muscles and and improve your cardiovascular endurance!

SWEAT classes run for 45 minutes and are led by our Spartan coach @georgecara_sngpr!
