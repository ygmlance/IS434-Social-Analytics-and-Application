Weng’s version of a homemade burger 🍔 Japanese wagyu beef patty seared on the outside for a great caramelization; paired with melted Irish mature cheddar, a distinctive yet mellow cheese; topped with fresh iceberg lettuce, crisp streaky bacon with a generous slap of ketchup, French mustard and mayonnaise; sandwiched between a soft lightly-toasted bun. Simply delicious 🍔
