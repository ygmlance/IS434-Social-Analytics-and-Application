#Throwback :  Great job Winnie the Pooh on adhering to the #socialdistancing rule 👍🏻 👍🏻 👍🏻 (p/s: Before the circuit breaker, we saw this toy sitting on the bench all by himself in #singaporebotanicgardens . We hope the owner has reunited back with his or her toy. Just looking at Winnie sitting down there all by himself makes me think about Woof Woof and Bun Bun which we lost in Singapore and Hawaii respectively. I hope whoever who has found them, please take good care of them for us) 😢😢😢 #circuitbreakersg #aloneinthepark #lonely #losttoys #losttoyinthepark #lost #winniethepooh
