#circuitbreakerday25 x #labourday2020 // What happens when everything you’ve tried to plant in a #daisoplanter dies or becomes snail-snax, and someone decides they might as well dump #papayaseeds there and in other random pots instead of throwing them away.
.
.
Quite a few fed the spotted doves that have been hanging out in the garden. And enough were left that we’ve now got a little papaya nursery going (until the snails decide they want some variety in their diet, that is). .
.
It’s just amazing that we did absolutely nothing to grow these #papayaseedlings. .
.
So it is also with all things, including any #gospelministry growth:
.
“For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?
For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not being merely human?
What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each.
I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labour.
For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's field, God's building.” (1 Corinthians 3:1-9)
