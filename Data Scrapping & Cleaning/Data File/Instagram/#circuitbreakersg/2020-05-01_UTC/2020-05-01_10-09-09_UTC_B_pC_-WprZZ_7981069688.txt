Wes Montgomery - Boss Guitar, 1963. This guy is a self-taught guitarist yet ranks up there with the best. This was one of his last albums recorded for #riversiderecords after which Wes played more pop-oriented albums which laid the foundation for what we call fusion. One of the most enjoyable and timeless guitarists to listen to.  #wesmontgomery #bossguitar #melrhyne #jimmycobb
