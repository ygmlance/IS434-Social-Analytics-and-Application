Jus Alpukat (or Avocado Shake) is a staple in many Indonesian warongs. I miss having this with the superspicy nasi ayam penyet. Easy peasy to make it yourself
.
Blend 4 ripe avocados in about 500ml fresh milk. Add more milk if it’s too thick. Some people add 2 tbsp condense milk but that’ll be too sweet and unhealthy imho but who’s to judge?
.
Separately, melt 1 cup of semi-sweet choc buttons. Use these to drip along the periphery of the glass/mug (like in photo). Then pour the avocado mixture into the mug and add ice cubes .
The reason for not stirring the choc directly into the mix is to allow the drinker some control over how sweet/chocolatey they want their drink. If they prefer it unsweetened they could just drink the jus alpukat like so. Otherwise they could use a teaspoon or stirrer to scrape the choc from the glass walls and stir it to dissolve in the drink. Get the idea?
