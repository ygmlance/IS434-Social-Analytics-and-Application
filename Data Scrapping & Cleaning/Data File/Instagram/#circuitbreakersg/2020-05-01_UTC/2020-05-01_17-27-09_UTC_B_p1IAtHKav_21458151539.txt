Gula Melaka Chiffon became Gula Melaka Sponge. Chiffon is really one of the toughest cake to handle imo. For a non pro baker like myself, many more trials and errors to get the form, texture &  airiness right. I did 3 bakes between 2 days and all did not achieve the airiness I desired from a chiffon. Taste wise? 9/10. There's no secret. Just use quality and natural ingredients. No syrup, no vegetable oil, no artificial essence. All pure and natural goodness. my only motivation in baking is to know exactly what goes into the desserts since I consume so much of them. I can choose natural and better quality ingredients and completely omit vegetable oils in all my cooking and baking. Look forward to the day I can post a nice and tall chiffon!!
