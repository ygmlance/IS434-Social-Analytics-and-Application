#circuitbreakersg Day 25 Fasting Day 08:
You’ve probably stumbled upon articles that the giants are spying on us via our own ‘smart’ devices. Be it on mic or camera, I personally feel that no one should ever feel truly secure. Are the devices hackable? Yes. Are our lives interesting enough to be hacked? Probably no. Do we still need some form of security? Definitely Yes! But how do we do it? First, learn not to fully trust anything you see or read online. Do not disclose anything personal to strangers. Less likely you have a Nigerian prince friend who are eager to offload you huge sums of money. Change passwords regularly, keep them complex too. Nope, your birth date is not a secret.
Be smart. Stay vigilant. And don’t pautoh.
