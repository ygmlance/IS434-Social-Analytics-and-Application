Happy Labour Day!

Quote from Singapore’s PM Lee “May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty. “

Our frontline frens are at high risks when supporting us. Let us do our part to support each other and help keep everyone safe. You are not alone. Be heartened that we live in the age of digital technology. Imagine if it happened back in time before 1992 ? NO SMARTPHONES 😱

As we all experience the new normal of family and work life, reflect and count our blessings 🙏

However strong we may be, we all STILL NEED words of encouragement, with upsetting news coming at us every time we log into social media. 
Lets strive to be more resilient than ever! Realise and cherish the moments with your loved ones! (Source : #knightfranksingaporeipm)
