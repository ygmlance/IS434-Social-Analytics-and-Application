One of my mama’s favourite recipe, mine too and now my husband’s favourite dish: 
Yee Mee Chicken “Claypot” Noodle 
We had this on our first day of Ramadhan. A little special since we are not able to eat with our parents during this circuit breaker period. 😢 #MakeItTogether #foodporn #foodoftheday #circuitbreakersg #ramadhan2020 @kitchenaidsingapore @aintohar @mayakarey @tusshara
