Happy Labour Day!  Labour Day is a day to celebrate the achievement of workers and @osteopathichealthcare would like to take this opportunity to salute and thank the essential service personnel everywhere!  When most of us feel that the world is at a standstill, it is the essential service personnel who are making this world go 'round right now!  We thank you and love you for your strength, hard work, dedication and care! üò∑‚ù§Ô∏è
