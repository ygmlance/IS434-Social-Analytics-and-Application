Happy May Day, friends!⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
We are already into a week of Ramadhan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting from dawn to dusk and night prayers.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Usually, our bodies would have already adapted to the fasting routine by now but this afternoon, my tummy was feeling all wonky. Pretty sure it’s gas but man, I was in pain. Thankfully, I still had a wee bit of Digize (pronounced “dye-jize”)⁣⁣⁣ left.
⁣⁣⁣
A blend of 8 oils: ginger, peppermint, fennel, anise, tarragon, juniper, lemongrass and patchouli essential oils, this oil has a rather interesting (almost stinky) aroma.⁣⁣ It’s an acquired scent, one would say. ⁣
⁣⁣⁣
So anyway, I had already fitted the roller fitment before this and rolled it directly over my tummy. The pain was gone almost instantly. I AM NOT EXAGGERATING.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
If you are prone to tummy aches or anything else in the tummy department, this is a must-have oil for you to bring wherever you go. Psst. Digize is one of the oils from the Premium Essential Oils collection in the Starter Kit. How about that!
