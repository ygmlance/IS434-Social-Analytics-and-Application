Just for Today - LOL means my Labour of Love! (a task done for pleasure, not reward)

An egg, turkey ham, leek, onions, tomatoes and black pepper make such a delicious #breakfast on this Day 25 of #circuitbreakersg that sometimes I forget which day it is.

Enjoying this “labour of love” very aptly on Labour Day!
