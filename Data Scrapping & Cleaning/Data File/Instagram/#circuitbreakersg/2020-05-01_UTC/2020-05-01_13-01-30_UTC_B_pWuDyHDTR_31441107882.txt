Happy Labor Day, Singapore!

Whether we call it #circuitbreakersg or #lockdown, most of us around the world are still stuck at home. This public holiday prolly don't mean much considering we've been home for days (or weeks for some). But today still calls for a toast to mark the solidarity of workers. This day reminds us all the power of collective strength, and there's no better time than now to activate that strength. 
Let's all remind ourselves, as much as it contradicts human nature, distance makes us stronger now. We will get through this together! ðŸ¥‚ to a healthier Singapore, a healthier world!
