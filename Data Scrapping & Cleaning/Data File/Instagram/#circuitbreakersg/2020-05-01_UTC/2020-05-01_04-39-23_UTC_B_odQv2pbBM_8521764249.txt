Look what came in the mail today!! I just had to share it. Been wanting to get my hands on a waterproof fabric. This Snoopy print tops the list! I paired it with a cotton batiste for more breathability & maxed out my patience (ok maybe just a bit) attempting this sew. üòÇ It's soo difficult bcos the waterproof fabric runs out of place easily & cotton batiste is just too light to work with. So we're still contemplating if this should go on sale. Nevertheless, I'm enjoying the print now! ‚ò∫Ô∏è #snoopy #snoopyprint #waterprooffabric #batiste #menwhosew #handmadewithlove #mask #reusablemask #handmadereusablemask #maskwithinserts #maskwithfilterpockets #fitment #covid19 #sgunited #sg #togetherwecan #stayathome #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #maskforguys #maskforladies #maskforchildren #maskon #reversiblemask #stayhomechallenge #prettymask #sewmen
