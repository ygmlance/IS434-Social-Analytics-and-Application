#CircuitBreakerSG D-25
Though I enjoy staying at home, I like to hang out at cafes sipping coffee, enjoying pastries & desserts, and catching up with those I care about.

I am staying at home and reminiscing some fond cafe memories. Thanks Daniel @fatdough13 for tagging.

I'm having some light & crispy Buttermilk Waffle with scrambled Eggs & Bacon, drizzled with Maple Syrup. Serving it with some fresh fruits & orange juice. Do you like sweet & savory waffles too?

Make a batch and keep them frozen. Just pop into the oven to heat up and enjoy any time.

Happy Labour Day.
