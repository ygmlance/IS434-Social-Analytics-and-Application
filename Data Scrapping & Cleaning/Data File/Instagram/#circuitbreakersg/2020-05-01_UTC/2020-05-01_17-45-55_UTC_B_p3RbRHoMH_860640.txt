SG❤ Yes, and in turn, ❤SG. 
Always have and always will. Even as others cast stones, the ones who quietly toil will continue to do so. Who else will bear the burden? Here's to our frontliners, the backenders. Down to the last man and woman who keep the wheels turning. Keep fighting 💪💪💪 #alittlefootprint #SGUnited
