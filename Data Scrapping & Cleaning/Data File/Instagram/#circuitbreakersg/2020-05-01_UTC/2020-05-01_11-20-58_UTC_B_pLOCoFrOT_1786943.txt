Saw this drink in a cafe previously in Korea, so I thought I'd try to make it and see what it tastes like. Actually not that bad, used freshly squeezed orange juice with some pulp and added some milk and a shot of @nespresso.sg 's Master Origin Ethiopia. ⁣
⁣
For the dried orange slice, I made it from scratch by placing it in the oven at 120°C for nearly 2 hours! ⁣
⁣
The orange flavour is really subtle and depending on the oranges used, the entire drink should either become sweeter or slightly sourer. ⁣
⁣
Thankfully, the oranges I had were sweet, so there was a nice tangy finish to the coffee!
