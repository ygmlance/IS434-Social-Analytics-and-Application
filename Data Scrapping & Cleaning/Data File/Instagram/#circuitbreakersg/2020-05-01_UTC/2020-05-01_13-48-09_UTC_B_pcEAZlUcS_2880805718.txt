Solid Australian beers from @templecellars 🇦🇺🍺
⁣
𝗖𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗻𝘂𝘁 𝗣𝗶𝗹𝘀𝗻𝗲𝗿 from Bridge Road Brewers. Brewed with chestnuts in the mash, the resultant nutty flavour gives a refreshing twist to the usual pilsner profile. Another great brew from the Australian craft brewer that has brought us such gems like the Bling IPA and Robust Porter.
⁣
𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗟𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 from Stone & Wood Brewing Co. This is another Australian craft brewer that has won me over with their Pacific Ale. The Green Coast Lager is as quaffable as its stablemate, striking a fine balance between its hops and malt to make this a quenching lager with character.
⁣
To me, Australian beers strike the sweet spot between bold flavour and ease of drinking. Perfect for Singapore's tropical climate! ⁣
