【Recipe】Tender chicken in luscious spicy satay sauce served over egg noodles. 
Been wanting to try this recipe🙈😋 Luckily it turned out pretty well. Though not quite the same as those satay bee hoon selling in stalls, this rendition is much simpler and yet packed full of flavours and who doesn’t loves satay! 
You can catch me cooking this in my IGS. 沙爹鸡配面。

Sharing the recipe for the chicken marinade and the satay sauce. You can skip the chicken marinade and just go with salt and pepper of course. 
I opted for Mee Pok because I didn’t want to use pasta or Mee hoon haha. But feel free to opt for anything you like.

1 cilantro root
4 tbsp shallot oil
1 tsp white peppercorns 
2 red chilli
1/2 tsp chilli powder
2 tbsp red curry paste ( you can omit the red chilli & chilli powder if store bought) Since I’m using #honeybeecookscurrychicken which is less spicy, I added them.

150ml coconut milk

100-200 ml water / stock to thin out
