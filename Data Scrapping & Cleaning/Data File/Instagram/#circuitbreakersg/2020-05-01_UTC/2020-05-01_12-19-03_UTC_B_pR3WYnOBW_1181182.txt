There is always something for everyone. Including housework. ðŸ˜†â €
â €
I've always been telling my kids to help out with housework, it does not matter if we have helper or not. Of course, with helper around, more nagging is needed for them to take up their own responsibility. â €
â €
So, this #circuitbreaker I told the kids, the hubby included, that everyone of us got to play a part! No matter the housework, doing activities or even taking care of baby, we all have to participate together as a family. â €
â €
HBL will be over soon, I will not do much scheduling, but snacks, meals and exercise time got to continue. Haha.. ðŸ˜… â €
I believe by now everyone have already known or exhausted ways and means to find activities for kids to do. Sometimes, it will be good to have free play, chill, or maybe sometimes let them fight among themselves. You will be amused at their creativity level. This is my take during this #CBperiod. ðŸ¤­â €

Same as @leftose there is always something for everyone in the family. That explains why it's easier to stock Leftose up in my first aid box. â €
From cough/phlegm solution for the kids, to lozenges and tablets for adults. They even have stickers inside the box of kids cough/phlegm solution! â €
â €
Leftose is a natural and non drowsy remedy which supports clear airways and promotes throat comfort! â €
â €
It's available at major pharmaceutical stores like @watsonssg @guardiansg , @glovida and @unitysg .
