It's difficult to get fresh fishes during this circuit breaker period but was glad to receive well packed fishes and seafood from @9sseafood .

My mummy says that eating fish is important because fishes provide a good source of protein and vitamins, and are a primary dietary source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.

I stay home and eat fishes. 🐟
