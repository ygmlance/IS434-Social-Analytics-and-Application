Labour Day
.

I miss work - not the emails and nonstop skype meetings and paperwork - but being surrounded by books on the mobile library bus and meeting and talking to the patrons, colleagues and drivers. As a desk bound manager, I live for these rare moments where I get to go on outreaches. .

11 Jan was the last time I was on the bus, when this picture was taken and I look forward to being back on the roads again, once the COVID-19 situation calms down. .
