Ipoh Salt Baked Black Pepper Chicken | 怡宝黑胡椒盐焗鸡｜

We are crossing borders today! We are going to Ipoh. Woohoo!! And our friend @threehandscook visited Singapore. 😂 wait for their update!

Kitchen Cheat | Pre-mixed Salted Chicken Spices

Brand: Herbalton
Price: SGD 3.99

Prep Time: 1hr 15mins (excluding marination time)
1. Rub the spices on the inside & outside of the chicken. Marinate the chicken a night before or minimally 3-4 hours. 
2. Wrap the chicken in an aluminium foil. Make sure you don’t get any holes or tear the aluminium foil. 
3. Steam the chicken for an hour. Alternatively you can roast the chicken at 180 degree celcius.

This dish won’t mess up the kitchen. Which is good! Who else hates cleaning the kitchen? 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️

Verdict: Brother rated it a 3.5 out of 5. It tastes more of a Black Pepper Chicken than a Ipoh Salt Baked Chicken. Will give their original flavour Ipoh Salted Chicken a try next time. It still tastes good as a Black Pepper Chicken! 🤤👌🏻.

Taste: The black pepper taste is not over powering, which is a plus! But a little salty.

P/s: that’s the brother giving the extra SFX behind the video. 🤣 #siblinggoals
