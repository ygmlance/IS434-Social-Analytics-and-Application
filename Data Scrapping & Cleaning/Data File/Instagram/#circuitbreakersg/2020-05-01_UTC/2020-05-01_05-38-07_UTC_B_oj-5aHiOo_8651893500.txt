What do you put in your toast?😋 🍳

#labourday calls for a nice Vegetarian Toast to start off the #longweekend 🛎🍞🍇🧀🥒, so I had a Cranberry and Butter toast filled with these vegetarian fillings .

In my Toast 🥪 — Sunny-side up egg, Toasted sunflower seeds, Parmesan cheese, Salad green vegetables, Carrots, Cucumbers and Coleslaw sauce~•* +

I like to fill my plate with vibrant colours of nature. They make my meals yummy, happy and full of healthy energy for the day! Wish you have a happy Labour Day and a good long weekend🌟😄🍾 🏝
