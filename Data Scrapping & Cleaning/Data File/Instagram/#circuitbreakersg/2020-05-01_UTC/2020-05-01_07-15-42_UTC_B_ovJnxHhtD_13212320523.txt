(Edited- 15&16 May is our next batch)
Yes our websites are now officially open!

We mentioned in our stories earlier that we have been given the green light by MTI- this means we have been approved as an essential service and granted manpower allocations. However the tightened measures meant closure till 4th May. Thus we will only reopen our kitchens from 5th May onwards. 
Supplies have been ordered (avos take time to ripen) we will only be able to fufil our first batch of orders from 9th May onwards.

We have also started working with a new delivery partner to bring you enhanced delivery services - promo $3 every Friday and Saturday for the month of MAY!

Yes you are now in time for an early Motherâ€™s Day deliveries on 9th MayðŸ’•

During this period we will only be offering our classiques in all flavours and Grands (original flavour only). Quantities are limited due to manpower shortage and this will be reflected in our website once itâ€™s sold out. Thank you for the patience thus far and we look forward to serving you again! .
