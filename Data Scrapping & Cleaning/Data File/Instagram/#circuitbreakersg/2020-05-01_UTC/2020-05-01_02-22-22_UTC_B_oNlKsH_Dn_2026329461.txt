Happy Labour Day! 
What a weird feeling to have a public holiday during the #circuitbreakersg. A bit of a non-event ðŸ˜‚

Well for me this time is all about doing my very best to keep my head in a good space. Focusing on  small positive details such healthy food, fresh flowers, bright colours etc They all help to keep me on an even keel..... well most of the time at least. I just  had to apologise  to my son for being grumpy about having hurt my back yet again!! The smallest wrong move makes an old  injury flare up again. But this pretty setting made me feel better. Now I guess I will rest a lot today. I hope you  are doing ok #takecare #staysafe #stayhome
