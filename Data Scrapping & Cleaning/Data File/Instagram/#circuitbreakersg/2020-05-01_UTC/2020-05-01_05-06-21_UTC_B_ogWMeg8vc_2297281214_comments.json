        "text": "Some friends asked for the recipe and as usual, I agak agak (eyeball) amounts so just guess depending on how many people you are cooking for. I'm sorry I don't usually weigh or measure anything. If you wish to have measurements, head to IG of @domestic_goddess_wannabe. Great recipes there!\nOk, here goes...\n- boil chicken bones, onion and garlic for broth. Maybe only need a cup or two.\n- chop up chicken breast or use chicken mince - chop celery, carrots, onions, garlic. If you're happy to add more carbs, then throw in some diced potatoes too. If you're too lazy to do from scratch just use frozen veggies. I'm not a huge fan of frozen veggies so I'm happy to chop up fresh veggies.\n- oil in a pan and brown the garlic and onion\n- add in the vegetables and stir them in\n- add in the chicken or mince and stir until fairly cooked\n- add in some stock. Not too much as you only need it to cook and soften the vegetables\n- stir and cover and let it cook for a while\n- add salt and pepper to taste\n- add some corn flour (mixed with water) if you want to thicken up the sauce of the pie (don't bother with this part id doing the mac and cheese version)\n- boil up some macaroni and drain\n- add some cream\n- add some mozzarella and cheddar cheese\n- stir and mix until cheese is melted add to the pie filling\n- add more cheese until the pie filling has thickened\n- ladle the pie filling into pie tray and add some segmented hard boiled eggs in too\n- use filo pastry or as I prefer, prata pastry and cover the pie filling\n- snip some holes onto the top of the pastry and into a preheated 200 degree oven it goes for about 15-20 min (or however long it takes to brown the pastry)\n- voila! You have Mac and cheese chicken pie!",
