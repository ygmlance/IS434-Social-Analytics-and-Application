On labour day and I’m labouring in the kitchen; for dinner we are having Teochew Porridge with steamed white pomfret, whitebait omelette, garlic chilli baby squid. 
I did something fancy on my pomfret 🐟😂, craft it like a peacock. First time doing this and I’m sweating over it.
Hope it looks presentable enough. 
I have cooked sweet potato porridge to go with the dishes.
Bon Appetit! 🤤
