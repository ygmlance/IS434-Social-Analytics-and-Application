Also completed today as a quick-and-breezy project - unicorn sleep dress/nightgown. Soooooo easy after the fiddly and frustrating outing/can-wear-to-church-when-CB-is-over dress. Haha. 
And she's super excited to wear it, so thank God I washed the fabric beforehand.... #sewing #noobdressmaking #preschoolerfashion #circuitbreakersg #quarantinecrafts
