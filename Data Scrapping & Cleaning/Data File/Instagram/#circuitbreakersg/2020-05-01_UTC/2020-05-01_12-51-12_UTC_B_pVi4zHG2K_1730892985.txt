More than just an airport terminal. 
I remember family trips to the airport, such as getting soya beancurd from the staff canteen to my grandfather’s place. T2 also holds all the highs and lows from my initial years of corporate life. The people I met, the random window shopping trips. Shops became more interesting with frozen yoghurt, donuts and bubble tea,  though what I really miss are the old canteen stalls (that lala hokkien mee, affordable western food and again kickass soya beancurd). The new could never replace the old the same way, here’s a virtual farewell till we meet again!
