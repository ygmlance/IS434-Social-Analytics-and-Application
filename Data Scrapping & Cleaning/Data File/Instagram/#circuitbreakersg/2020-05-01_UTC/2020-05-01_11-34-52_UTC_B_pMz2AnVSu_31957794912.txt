I just feel like cooking n baking up a storm today after all that HIIT. Inspired by a previous post by master chef @lavazza66, I’ve been craving (I’ve many cravings I know) for some yam cake so here goes. A nostalgic dish that my mum used to make so very often n always hit the spot. Sending this to her & hoping she’ll enjoy it as must as I do. ❤️😊 so creamy with grated yam & packed with lotsa mushrooms, dried shrimps & Chinese sausage 😝 Cooked some fermented black bean beef hor fun for lunch too. Didn’t have fat hor fun so used thin kuey Teow n yellow noodle. CB means use what you’ve at home. Still Pretty legit!🤪 I like that I can apportion all my meals for the next few days. ✌️
Made some tagliatelle from scratch cos my ntuc ran out of pasta (beat that!) for dinner. Kneading the dough can be sooo therapeutic. 🌞So later! .
