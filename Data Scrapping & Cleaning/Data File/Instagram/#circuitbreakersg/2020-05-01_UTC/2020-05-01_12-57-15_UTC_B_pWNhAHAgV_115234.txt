Circuit breaker is really a good chance for us to finally learn to cook our Mummy's dishes. Today I experimented with Ter Kah Bee Hoon 猪脚米粉 (aka Pork Knuckle Beehoon). Been craving for this dish for a while now! And I decided to give it a try.

Garlic > pre-soaked Mushrooms > Canned Pork Knuckle > pre-soaked Beehoon > Beansprouts > Done! Easy! Let me know if your household cook this dish, and if you gna try it for the first time!
