Stay home for indoor water play?

Nah... at my old age, I rather be napping comfortably.... not sure if I am part of the Pawneer 🐾 or Meeehderka 🐑 generation? 🤔

A soft blanket is more inviting... sorry, unicorns 🌈 🦄! I don’t like getting wet nowadays, maybe it’s the arthritis, especially on rainy days... Guess maybe I will have more fun another day when I am feeling better... can we skip the water? 🥶💦 By the way, when is Brenda, playmate hooman coming to visit me? 🙁
