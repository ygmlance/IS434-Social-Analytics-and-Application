•RECIPE• I love dishes when they go well with rice. Another one that is a staple in many Chinese families cos the ingredients are so readily available in the kitchen. ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
• 300g loin meat, sliced thinly
• Minced garlic
• 2 stalk of spring onion, chopped into about 4parts each
• A few slices of ginger
• 2 tbsp oyster sauce • 1 onion, sliced thinly
• 1 tbsp fish sauce
• 1 tbsp sesame oil
• 1 teaspoon cornflour

METHOD:
1) Marinate the Sliced pork with the condiments and cornflour. Leave aside for at least 30minutes.
2) Fry ginger over high heat till fragrant
3) Add in the garlic, onion and white part of the spring onion and continue to fry till fragrant. 
4) Add in the pork over high heat and mix well. You can add alittle water if you want to have some gravy to go with rice. 
5) Add in the remaining spring onion. Fry for another  30 seconds and voila! ============================================================ #pork #springonion #15minutemeals #15minutesrecipe #simple #sgig #sgrecipes #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodstep #instagfoodsg #singaporehomecooks #homecookedmeals #whati8today #instagfoodsg #家常便饭 #sgfoodlover #onepotmeal #comfortfoods #circuitbreakersg
