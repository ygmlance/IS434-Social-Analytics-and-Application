Seafood Soup with Rice | Êµ∑È≤úÊ≥°È•≠ÔΩú

Disclaimer: This is a not-so-quick recipe, but still an easy one pot meal.

What do you do when you have leftover rice? Instead of congee which is really soft & silky texture, Ê≥°È•≠ uses deep fried rice that has a crispy crunch.

Kitchen Cheat | Frozen Prawn Paste & Ikan Bilis Stock Cubes

Prep Time: 40 mins
1. Soak dried scallop & dried shrimp. Finely chop the dried shrimp. 
2. Marinate defrosted scallop with Mirin & sake. Pan fry scallop and set aside. 
3. Saut√© garlic & dried shrimp until fragrant. Add in water & dried scallop to boil. 
4. Add ikan bilis stock cube, scallop, frozen prawn paste & sliced Naba cabbage (Â§ßÁôΩËèú) to soup. Continue to boil in low heat. 
5. Season with Mirin & Sake for the sweetness. 
6. Deep fry leftover rice until golden brown & crunchy. Drain the access oil with kitchen roll.
7. I added chopped Kai Lan for the crunchy texture. 
8. Put Kai Lan & deep-fried rice just before serving. You don‚Äôt want them to turn soggy.

This is my first attempt on Êµ∑È≤úÊ≥°È•≠! Will try it with oven baked rice on day. Deep frying is just too messy.

Verdict on Frozen Shrimp Paste: 3.5 out of 5.
Taste: not fishy, lightly salted.
Texture: springy with visible prawn meat. 
You can still see huge lumps of prawn meat which is good. It adds to the texture. I can‚Äôt remember the price for this shrimp paste üò¨.

I do think you can swap frozen shrimp paste with fresh prawn. It should add to the sweetness in the seafood soup.
