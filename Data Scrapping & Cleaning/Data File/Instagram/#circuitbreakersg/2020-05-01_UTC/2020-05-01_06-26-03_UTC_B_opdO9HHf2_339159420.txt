#Circuitbreakersg Day 25
.
Without Labour, Nothing Prospers
.
May Day, or Labour Day, celebrates the value and importance of labour put into our work
.
Obtaining success is hard - whether you work in the office, from home, on the road, in a factory or in a hospital etc
.
So on this day, if you have the privilege to do so, give yourself a pat on the back and take a breather. You have done well
.
A shout out especially to all those who, on this day, are still working on the frontline and in essential services - I say a big THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart
