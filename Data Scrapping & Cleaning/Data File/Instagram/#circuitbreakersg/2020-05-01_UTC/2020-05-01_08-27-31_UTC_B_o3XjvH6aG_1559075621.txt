2013 vs 2020
Old me vs Now me

When I become a mom, I didn't care about my outlook, just being happy looking auntie!

After I joined Mary Kay in 2018, I realise that as a woman, being pretty not just inside, but outside is just as important, to have confidence in oneself!

进得了厨房，出的了庭堂。

Self Love and care is definitely so important! Looking at these before and after photo. I am glad I started this building beauty confidence journey. ❤️ Feel free to DM me!! #MaryKayMySg #Power13MYSGDay3
