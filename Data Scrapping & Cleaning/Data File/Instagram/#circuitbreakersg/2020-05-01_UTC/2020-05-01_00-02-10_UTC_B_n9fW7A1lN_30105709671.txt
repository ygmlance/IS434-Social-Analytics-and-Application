Being at home for an extended period of time means we end up doing lots of silly things, including these 5 types of "sports" and preparing our 4th home video for your entertainment! We tried a marathon, swimming, 100m dash, curling and dancing all in the comfort of our home! 
This video is done as part of our efforts to keep families entertained at home and also done in jest. If you decide to do any of the "sports", do share it with us in the comments below too! 
We hope you enjoyed watching the video and had a good laugh too! We sure had fun preparing the video!
