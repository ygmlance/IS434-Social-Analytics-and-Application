My interest in real estate is probably was sparked off by my mummy who was a property agent. Back then, it was backbreaking giving out flyers and slotting them into mailboxes (and iâ€™d helped her do this when I was a #teen). So I honestly feel for the property agents / realtors, in this 2 month circuit breaker. It is hard for them to carry on their livelihood to market and sell homes during this period. So any plugging by me here really is just sharing and hoping this benefits my friend/property agent, owner and the purchaser! ðŸ’•âœ…see #linkinbio ðŸ’•Happy Friday everyone! ðŸ¤— .
