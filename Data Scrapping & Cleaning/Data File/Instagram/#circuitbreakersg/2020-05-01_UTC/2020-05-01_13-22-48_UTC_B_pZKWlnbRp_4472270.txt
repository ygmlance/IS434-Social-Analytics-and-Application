Activity 1: Rainbow numbers
Activity 2: Monster Eyes

My attempt to teach 123s and make it fun. 
Shes not 100% great at matching the numbers but was able to match colours albeit not all. After awhile she refuse to stick them anymore even with my plead. So this one has to be repeated again. I love that this can be so versatile - bigger rainbow for more numbers. 
Oh, monster eyes was definitely more fun! And both were also good for attention and fine motor skills training.
