Throwback Eastern Hokkaido exploration  trip Jul 2018. It's Day 25 of S'pore Cv-19 lockdown. I had the honoured opportunity of being sponsored by Nippon Travel Agency (the oldest & most established travel agency in Japan) and Hokkaido Tourism Bureau to showcase the beauty of the island. Hokkaido is simply more than the winter wonderland its famed for. Summer has colours and activities that will have you want to come back for more, like the salmon run at Kiyosato or fishing at Lake Kussharo. My heart aches to visit Hokkaido yet again. Till the Cv-19 pandemic subsides, take good care and stay safe. 🙏😷👍
