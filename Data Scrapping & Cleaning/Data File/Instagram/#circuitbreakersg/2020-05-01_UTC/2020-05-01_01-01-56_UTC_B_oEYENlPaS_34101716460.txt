To celebrate the official end of university life yesterday👩🏻‍🎓, I decided to make my ultimate favourite comfort food - oven baked chicken wings (except I #airfried it for a change). The wings were very simply marinated with #garlicpowder, #smashedgarlic, #soysauce, #blackpepper and #oliveoil the day before.  All I did was throw them into the air fryer at 180°C for 18 minutes (flipping them at the halfway mark) and then at 200°C for 5 minutes to really crisp it up. I loved it. My family loved it. It will become a weekly staple now..😋 #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
