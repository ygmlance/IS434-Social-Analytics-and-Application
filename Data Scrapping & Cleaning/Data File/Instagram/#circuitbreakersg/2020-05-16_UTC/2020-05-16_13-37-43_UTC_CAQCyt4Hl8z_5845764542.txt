Oh how I wish I could do nothing this CB except paint the whole day!

The girls were very pleased with their masterpiece this time round because they did everything on their own, from ideation, colour selection to actual painting, with very little help from mummy. 👏👏 I titled mine "The Enchanted Castles", H painted her hamster toy, L was a unicorn and the best is K, she drew herself running away from a monster and into a castle. She said "soooo scary!" 🤪
