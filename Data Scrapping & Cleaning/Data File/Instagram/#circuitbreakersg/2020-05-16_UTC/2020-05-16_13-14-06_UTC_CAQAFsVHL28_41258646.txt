How I miss yummy chicken rice! Not that oily! Gotta to love the one in the kopitiam outside my house. 30+ years old chicken rice, my childhood flavour. Afternoon always sells the best chicken rice. Char Kway Teow for dinner, the stall opposite 古早味 porridge is our favourites for dinner. #circuitbreakersg #lunch #dinner
