Ah Kah Ji Craft Lager by Archipelago Brewery üá∏üá¨üç∫
‚Å£
This was recommended to me by a hophead friend, and I can see why. I think of malt when I think of lagers, but this brew is way more hop-forward than is typical. The spice from Czech Saaz hops comes through strongly, making this beer taste more like a spooled-up pilsner than a lager.

The malt is discernible in the middle of each pull, giving a muted balance to the overall hoppiness. You may not appreciate this brew if you're new to craft and are looking for a malt-forward beer; but if you're a craft veteran and like your hops, this is definitely worth a quaff.

Kudos to @archipelagobrewerysg for being bold and pushing the boundaries in their creations! ‚Å£
