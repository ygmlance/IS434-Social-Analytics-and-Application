Heard so much rave reviews of @ahhuateochewnoodle, so when the East floodgate opened, I jumped on the bandwagon to text Jean to place my order
.

A simple bland-looking bowl of Signature Bee Tai Mak (BTM) $5, that had a myriad of flavours that made me want to continue. Never read a book by its cover, I agree
.

It had been a while since I gobbled a bowl of such up on my own. Belly lardy good

Such small doodle notes do brighten up my days. Really such an effort to do these. Love them. The note is still pasted on my board. Thanks for these little thoughts, Jean
.
Waiting for the next floodgate to open before I order again. Check @ahhuateochewnoodle FB for the delivery locations before you Whatsapp them at +65 8815 0716
