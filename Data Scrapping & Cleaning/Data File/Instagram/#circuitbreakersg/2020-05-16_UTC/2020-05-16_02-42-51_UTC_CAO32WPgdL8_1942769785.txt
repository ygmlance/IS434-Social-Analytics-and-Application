These diffuser blends can help you to shift your emotions and feel better. â €
â €
Swipe and choose an emotion you would like to step into. Add to your diffuser 3 drops of the corresponding oil along with 3 drops of Wild Orange. Then, just breathe.â €
â €
You can diffuse during the day as needed.â €
â €
Your sense of smell is 10,000 times more sensitive than any other senses. Essential oils work directly with our brain and our limbic system â€”where memories and emotions are stored. Try out these blends and change your vibe. ðŸ˜‰â €
