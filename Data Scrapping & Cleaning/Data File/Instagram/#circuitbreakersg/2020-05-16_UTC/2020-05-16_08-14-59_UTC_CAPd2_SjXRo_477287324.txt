I never heard of chai tea. It was a gift and I just left it hoping to give it away until i saw someone baked a chai tea chiffon in FB. So i finally opened and myself a cup of chai tea to try and now here is my chai tea chiffon cake. I use chai tea powder and replaced soy milk with fresh milk. So join me for chai tea?
