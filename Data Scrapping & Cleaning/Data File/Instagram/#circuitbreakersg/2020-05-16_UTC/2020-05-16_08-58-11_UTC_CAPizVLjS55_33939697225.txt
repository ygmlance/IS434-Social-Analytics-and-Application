~ Safari Shibuya Toast ~ The elder Simlet asked to go to the zoo umpteen times today. We explained that the zoo is closed because of "Mr Virus". The disappointed girl said "But I want to see many animals". So mama offered to make something with many animals. Ta-dah, toddler-friendly Safari Shibuya Toast made of fresh fruits, honey butter, toddler biscuits, a little indulgent of whipped cream and unsweetened cocoa powder. Now she wants a "dog and rabbit toast tomorrow".
