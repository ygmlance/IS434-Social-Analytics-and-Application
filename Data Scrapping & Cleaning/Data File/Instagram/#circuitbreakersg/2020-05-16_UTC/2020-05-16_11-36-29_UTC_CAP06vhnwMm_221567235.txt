Got a bit of flour, some fruit and sugar? That’s pretty much all you need for a very simple English crumble, which is what my talented hubby threw together in the oven for this lovely, oozy, biscuity raspberry, apple & blueberry mess. 😍💕You can pretty much use any sweet fruit, and bash some digestive biscuits in a bag for the topping if you don’t have flour. 🍒🍑🍓🍊🍋🍎 #Saturday #weekend #circuitbreakerSG #myhubbyisamasterchef #sgeats
