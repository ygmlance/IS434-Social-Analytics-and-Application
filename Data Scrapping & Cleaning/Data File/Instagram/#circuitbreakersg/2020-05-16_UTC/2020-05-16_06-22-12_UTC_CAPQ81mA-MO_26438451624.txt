Girl craving for Kong Bak Pao but wanna be lean and healthy ... so give her Kong Chicken Pao instead 😆. We love the thick gravy for the chicken and the chilli is awesome! Never having just a single dish ... ordered the DIY laksa too... the gravy is sooo good that 3 of us slurped all in (meant for 5)! Wonderful start for the weekend! @fortunefoodsg #diylaksa #kongbakpau #stayhome #stayhomedelivery #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #comfortfood #fatdieme #yummy #yummyfood #yumyum #enjoythemoment #superyummy #food #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #foodstagram #sgfood #foodsg #foodblogsg #eatinginsingapore #sgfooddiary #sgfoodlover #sgfoodheaven #foodie #foodlovers #吃是福 #eatingisabliss #happyfood #thankgodforthefood
