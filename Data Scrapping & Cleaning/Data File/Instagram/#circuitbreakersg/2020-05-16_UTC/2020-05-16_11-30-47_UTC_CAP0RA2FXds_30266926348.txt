CB DAY 41 -

Weekends are the most fun because we do whatever the kid wants. ðŸ˜Š

We laze around the bed, play dress up, have a good yummy lunch with his favorite fruits, followed by water play in the bath tub, waking up from a nap to play bricks, and even going out for a quick stroll by our rented car. 
Next month we will finally be receiving our first family car. Because of the COVID-19 situation, there's been a 2 month delay and we cannot wait to welcome a new addition to the family ðŸ˜Œ
