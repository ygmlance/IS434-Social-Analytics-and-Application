2 more weeks before Circuit Breaker ends.. What will the new normal be?

Things will never be able to go back to how it used to be. We have to trade freedom for safety. New habits have to be formed and invisible lines drawn up to protect our survival from the enemy.

But I am grateful to be well and alive. To be able to hope, laugh, live and love. Looking forward to a new adventure everyday and getting myself ready for the new normal that is to come 🙌🏻 #newnormal #nofear #circuitbreakersg #bounceback #covid19 #positivevibes #freedom
