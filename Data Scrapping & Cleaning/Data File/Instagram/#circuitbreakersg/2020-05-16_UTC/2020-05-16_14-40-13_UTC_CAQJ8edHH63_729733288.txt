Phew! Busy day. This morningâ€™s #breakfastsituation thanks to my lovely sis for the surprise! Was trying to figure out who sent these lovely tarts cos we usually msg each other if we are sending any â€˜care packâ€™ during  this #circuitbreakersg 
The tarts from @kura.singapore are so pretty and yummy! Love the key lime tart too (got into our bellies before we remember to take picture ğŸ˜…). ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥° #thankfulgratefulblessed #cafeathome
