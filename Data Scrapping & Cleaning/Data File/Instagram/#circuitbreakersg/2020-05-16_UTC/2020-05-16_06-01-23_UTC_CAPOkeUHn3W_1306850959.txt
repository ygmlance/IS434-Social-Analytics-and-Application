☀️Never had the earth been so lovely nor the sun so bright, as today...☀️ Yeah, so true! Its so sunny today that I decided to just cook my own breakfast instead of going out to buy. So, I cooked some Korean meat dumplings and my lazy Kitty on the sofa wasn’t very pleased about it. Because...both of us are always daydreaming on when we can visit Tokyo again... 🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵 That’s the concept of today’s chocolate painting! 🤗 This piece is quite challenging due to the details and I took an hour to complete. Nevertheless, I get to practice on drawing many lines! 🤣 Drawing the Sensoji (Asakusa Kannon Temple) is especially intensive but actually I think the most difficult is to draw Hello Kitty! Somehow, it’s not easy to get Hello Kitty’s face proportion right. 🤔 Anyway, I hope this drawing brings you great memories of your previous Tokyo trip! For now, we shall continue to wait patiently on when we can all travel again, hopefully within this year! ✈️
