Kopi On The Go - Eid Countdown
(Blk 663 Buffalo Road - 1930hrs) .
.
As the last 10 nights of Ramadan and Eid coutdown has begun, a deeper sense longing becomes more and more apparent to me.  Spending more time in the mosque, means so much more than before. This year, a whole different story which led to an incident earlier today.
.
.
The mosques being closed for awhile now, meant that for Muslims like me that are required to travel around for work, finding a spot to solat may not be as easy as one thinks. Fortunately for me, I drive around with my sajadah and sarong in the van.
.
.
As I was doing my Zuhur prayers at a little corner near my van, an Uncle stopped by and sat, watching as I completed my prayers. He introduced himself as Uncle Francis, a man whom I've seen around the estate ever since I started working this cluster. He smiled and said,
..
"I'm sorry you can't pray at the mosque because of Covid19. That's why I always see you here at this timing right? I will tell some of the people nearby to either quieten down or move away to give you some time."
..
All I did was do my own thing, and here I have, Uncle Francis who helped in his own little way. Wish we could have such pleasantries in everyone. Thank you Uncle Francis.
