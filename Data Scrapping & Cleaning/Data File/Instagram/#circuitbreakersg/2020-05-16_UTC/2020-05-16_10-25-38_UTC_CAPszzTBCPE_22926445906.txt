@victorskitchensg How is it possible you guys manage to churn out such beautiful 流沙包s for delivery??? The custard and melted butter oozed out unknowingly, catching us all by surprise! Honestly we were not expecting the steamed goodness to flow so radiantly after the long delivery ride......... The XO carrot cake was so smooth and palatable that the husband almost gobbled everything up by himself. 😤

I CAN SMELL IT ALL OVER AGAIN JUST BY TYPING THIS. The XO sauce and oil was well complimented by the already smooth textured steamed carrot cake! Really a plus 💯 for this dish.

P.S. Not sure which outlet they fulfill their delivery orders from, since they currently have 2 outlets - Sunshine Plaza and Chinatown. I've only been to the Sunshine Plaza prior to #circuitbreakersg. Grew up in the hood since SMU was nearby........ Anyway, islandwide delivery is ongoing at a reasonable $5 per trip. Honestly a perfect 5 stars from me for Victor's Kitchen. 👅👍
