They say that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. That is true! My wife absolutely knows this. I am so blessed to have a wise and loving woman in my life! 
Felt so loved today because instead of resting, she decided to bake me the nicest, tastiest Japanese sponge cake. Both my stomach and heart are full to the brim and blessed in the overflow. 
Thank you @lanynoviyani for being such a blessed gift in my life!
