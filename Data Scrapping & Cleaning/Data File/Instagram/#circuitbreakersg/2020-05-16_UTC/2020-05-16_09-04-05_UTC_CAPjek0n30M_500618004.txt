Home cooked dish by my sil. Pork Trotter Vinegar, a traditional Cantonese dish for confinement mother's to consume in order to help them to enhance their energy. For our family, we can have this dish anytime.
I used to eat pork trotter vinegar every day when I was in confinement, especially the ginger and hard boil egg.  Yum yum 😋😋
