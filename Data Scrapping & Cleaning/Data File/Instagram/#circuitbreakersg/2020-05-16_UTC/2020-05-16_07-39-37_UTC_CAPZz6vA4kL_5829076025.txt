It's D-16 till the Circuit Breaker ends!!! Hope everyone is doing well and healthy as usual. :) Over the past weeks, we decided to get a Go Pro to use for our future vlogs and jumped on an offer from Shopee! 
We also made pancakes for Mother's Day! How did you celebrate your Mother's Day? Drop a comment below!

P.S. Watch this space for a bonus video tomorrow! ;) Watch our new vlog on DS Archives on YouTube: https://youtu.be/Sa_5wZZiVtA
