Circuit breaker edition: Green tips to know and habits to have💭

#circuitbreakertip 5: PRACTICE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT

If your fridge is constantly packed with 🥬🍎🥩🥕during this stay home period, this is for you!

Are you guilty of ever having spoilt food at the back of your fridge? According to MEWR, 24% of households are with you.

With a fridge filled with all sorts of food items, keeping track of the items can be a hassle, so here’s a simple tip: Practice FIFO (First In, First Out) by rearranging your food.

Everytime you want to store food in your fridge, make it a habit to rotate the food such that the older food comes forward and the recent buys go to the back. 🔄 This way, you'll no longer have to reach to the back of your fridge or deal with the ocassional bottle of expired food 🤢
