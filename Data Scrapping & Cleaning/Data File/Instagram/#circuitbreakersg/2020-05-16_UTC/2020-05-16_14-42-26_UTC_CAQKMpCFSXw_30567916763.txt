#circuitbreakersg day 40

My first meal when I arrived in Murano, Italy almost 2 years ago, was delicious. I had seafood spaghetti, he had bolognese and we shared a side of mussels cooked in white wine sauce. ðŸ˜‹ .

So this is my re-creation of the mussels in white wine sauce that we had. ðŸ¤—

Today, Iâ€™m grateful for photographs. ðŸ“¸ Because of them, I am able to revisit the beautiful colourful houses in Murano and my lovely memories of that trip. #gratitudediary
