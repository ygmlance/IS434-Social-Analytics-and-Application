Our struggles push us to places we never thought we would go to reveal the brave person we never knew we could become.

May 2020 - second month of #circuitbreakersg was a month of new limits. Good or bad really depends on our perspective of life. I had my moment when I brokedown as I was so overwhelmed by my work projects, home based learning, clingy child, lack of proper sleep and the worst of all the house seems to be falling apart. Literally! Water was dripping from the fridge, AC units were breaking down one by one, multiple lights were flickering. How crazy is that? It‚Äôs normal to feel super lousy at times, what matters more is how soon are we going to snap back to our positive state of mind. I simply can‚Äôt express how appreciative I am to many of you who send me encouraging messages and repair service contacts üòò

Amidst the chaos, I end up being more productive in work like never before and managed to still juggle the demands of motherhood. I would not have the chance to discover and experience this new found determination towards creating a better and more fulfilling life if it wasn‚Äôt for the extended circuit breaker and all the unpleasantness that came along with it. ‚ò∫Ô∏è oh and did I mentioned about the random surprise gifts my friends have send over? I guess everything happen for a reason. A good one! Ps: Sharing 2 good aircon contacts here! Kenneth 97340774 and Max 81183013. . . Outfits: @gymwearmovement Enjoy 15% with code <Charlotte15> .
