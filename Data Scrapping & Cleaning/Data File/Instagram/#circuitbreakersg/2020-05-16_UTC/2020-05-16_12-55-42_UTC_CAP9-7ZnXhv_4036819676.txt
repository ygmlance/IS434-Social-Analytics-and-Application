Today, it was a new ride around city and marina 🚲. Due to circuit breaker measurements, I hardly walk outside even though I ride my 800gs daily.  I’ve been noticing my legs strength are getting weaker as well as stamina is lower.  So...here it is, another “bike” for endurance training💪🏻 Well, the training needs to be started after Ramadan is over😅. I was seriously dying and sickened from dehydration today...
.
It was a beautiful day, and when I started peddling, wind breezes came nicely.  Rode a short trails along the water that was awesome scenery🙌. .
When CB will be lifted, I’d like to go and ride the Pulau Ubin.  Who wants to join me? 😝.
