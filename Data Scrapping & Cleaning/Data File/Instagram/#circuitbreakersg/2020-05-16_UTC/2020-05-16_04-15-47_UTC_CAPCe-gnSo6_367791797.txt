Happy weekend everybuddy!! Hope you are all keeping safe and well 😊 
End of my week 8 WFH and counting down to 2 more weeks of CB before it can get lifted here in SG 😄😃😁 🙏 
Looking ahead and still counting all the blessings and feeling grateful for many things! Families, friends, health, safety, good meals, clean water and a stable job. This week, I had started with a busy schedule and worked late a few nights due to US timezone meeting and project standup call arrangement. I had other colleagues working even later than me or early in their morning to get connected. I loved how they are so committed to and we have strong beliefs and trust as a dedicated team together to deliver a client commitment. 
Sharing some healthy meals photos I took this week from @miseenplace_sg. Quick & easy cooking in under 15 mins 😉😋😋 Take care and stay safe ❤️ #miseenplace #stayingathome #fastandeasycooking #quickandeasycooking #circuitbreakersg #workingfromhomecooking #gratitude #healthymealkits #eatingrealfood
