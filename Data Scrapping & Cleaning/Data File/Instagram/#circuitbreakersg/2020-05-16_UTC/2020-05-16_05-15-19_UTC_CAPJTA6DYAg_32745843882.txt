It's done!!! ✂️
Pattern: Mama's market bag by @blackrosestitches
Took 1.5days to complete, in between the grocery shopping, baking and bumming around. Plenty of takeaways from this project:
👜
First, the yarn. I used almost an entire skein of 16-ply #cottonsilkyarn from @craftershub_craftershub in midnight blue 💙. The yarn material is a blend of 50% cotton fibre, 30% milk fibre and 20% rayon. Conversely, European/ US-branded yarns @yarnspirations @lovecraftscom (very overpriced in SG) typically comprise more familiar sounding materials like 100% cotton, acrylic, various wool types (merino, alpaca etc) or a blend of these materials. The yarn was relatively easy to work with, but I'm not sure how different it wld have been had I used a 100% cotton yarn instead. I was also confused by the term '16-ply' and wasnt entirely sure whether the yarn was suitable for this project, but I guess it worked fine. The end product is quite heavy for a small tote (~180g), so a lighter material may be more appropriate. It's not a bad yarn, just not best suited for this project. I really like the colour though and wanted to purchase more for other projects, but these are out of stock at the moment. 🧶
2nd, the pattern. This is my first project beginning with a magic ring (apart frm my very first attempt at making a coaster) and with 3 distinct patterned sections, starting with a hdc round the magic circle, 3x hdc cluster in the middle section and the sc at the top. I made 2 minor modications to the original pattern: I chained 3 instead of 2 for every new row in the middle section, and I shortened the strap from 50sc to 30. The joint at the top section is quite bulky (see 2nd pic) due to the sc in same chain, but possibly makes for a sturdier joint as compared to counting the beginning ch1 as a stitch (my guess 🤷🏻‍♀️). 🧷
3rd, the completed item. It's a lot smaller than expected at ~11" by 11" excluding the strap, but decently sized for my kindle, wallet and phone and possibly a small bottle of water. Nth too heavy otherwise it sags, but I guess the same goes for all crochet bags/ totes. I'll probably make a few more tweaks to make this bigger the next time I try this pattern
