disastrous attempt at making #soufflépancakes - using my spare time during the #circuitbreakersg to experiment in the kitchen. was excited to try this after watching @troyesivan and @lallimusic film a recipe video for @bonappetitmag; this is harder than it seems on paper. generous dusting of icing sugar, drizzling of honey and scattering of blueberries to cover up this monstrosity. taste wise was alright but not something I’d make again. #covid19
