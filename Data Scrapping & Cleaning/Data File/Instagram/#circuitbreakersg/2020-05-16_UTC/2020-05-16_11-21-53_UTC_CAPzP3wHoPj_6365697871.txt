my modified version of 37 calories brownie ( prob becomes 60 calories per piece after my adjustments, if you split it into exactly 9 pieces). There is a slightly sour taste in the first bite & I didn’t like it initially ( most likely from the Greek yogurt & you can see bits of the oats in the second pic 😍).But. I’m strangely drawn to take another bite AND another piece after finishing one. So, can I classify it as a strangely addictive sour brownie? 🤔 ⁣
⁣
IMO, it begin to taste better after each bite so, please give it a second try after the first few bites. Your opinion MIGHT change to it’s favour from the flavour 😉.⁣

INGREDIENTS 
3/4 cup nonfat greek yogurt ⁣
1/4 cup skim milk ( I used Meiji Low fat milk) ⁣
1/2 cup Cocoa powder⁣
1/2 cup Old fashioned rolled oats (I used Quaker quick cook oats)⁣
1/2 cup Truvia Baking Blend (or any natural/stevia based sweetener that pours like sugar) - I used normal sugar LOL AHAH ⁣
1 egg⁣
1 teaspoon baking powder⁣
1 pinch salt⁣
⁣
Additional ingredients but strongly recommend: ⁣
( I added to mine!) ⁣
Chocolate chips - your own scale ⁣
Walnuts - your own scale ⁣
⁣
⁣
INSTRUCTIONS⁣
-Preheat the oven to 400 °F/ 200 degrees. ⁣
-Grease a square baking dish or any baking dish you can find, really, just not too small, ideally 8x8! ⁣
-Combine all ingredients into a food processor or a blender, and blend until smooth (about 1 minute). -> I WHISKED IT BY HAND IF YOUVE NO BLENDER OR IF YOURE JUST LAZY like me. 😀 ⁣
-Pour into the prepared dish and bake for about 15 minutes. ( my oven took 20 mins @ 200 degrees) ⁣
-Allow to cool completely before cutting into 9 large squares. -> I cut into 15 small squares ⁣
