Last night's little adventure - as I have not stepped into a hawker centre since the start of the #circuitbreaker and I was super excited! The smell of all our local food absolutely heightened the excitement. Haha.

It's gonna be quite sad when some of these older Singaporean hawkers retire. I love buying from them, esp the smiley ones!
