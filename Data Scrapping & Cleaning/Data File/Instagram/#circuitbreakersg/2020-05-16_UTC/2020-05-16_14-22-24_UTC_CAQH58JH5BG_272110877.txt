Day 38. Another lazy Saturday. After tidying the freezer, Mr. decided to cook today. Lunch is sliced pork drizzled with spicy garlic sauce. (蒜泥白肉) Best served chilled, ideal dish for a hot day. It was a good afternoon as all of us enjoyed  our me-time. Took a good photo of Nom as he was busy peeping at my  screen. A golden evening as usual. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #spendingtimewithfamily #instadaily
