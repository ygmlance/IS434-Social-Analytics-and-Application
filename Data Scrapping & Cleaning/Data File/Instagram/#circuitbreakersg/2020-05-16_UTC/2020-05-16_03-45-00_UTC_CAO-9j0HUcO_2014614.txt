If there is one dish I won't attempt to recreate at home, it would be Kway Chap even though it's one of my favourite local delights (I love anything pork-related! LOL). Though it looks simple, it definitely ain't easy to prepare - especially the handling and cleaning of the intestines! And I must say @bukit_merah_view_kway_chap nailed it! Their chitterlings are devoid of smell and I love 'em! ⁣

We got the 5 pax set meal at $18.50 and the portion's quite huge! Like I always say, a good meal doesn't have to be fancy or expensive! I like how they pack the braising sauce for the kway (flat rice noodles) separately. Even more impressed that there is no spillage despite the long journey from the stall to my home. Oh, I love the slightly spicy and tangy chilli sauce too! ⁣

The hearty braised offal dish is available for both takeaway and delivery. Minimum order is $15 with a delivery fee between $6 to $10, depending on your location. Check out their page for more deets! ⁣
