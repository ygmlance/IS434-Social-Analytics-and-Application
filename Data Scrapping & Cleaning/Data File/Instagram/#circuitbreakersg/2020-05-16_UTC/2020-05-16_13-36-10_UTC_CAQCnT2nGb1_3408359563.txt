Day 40 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (16 May 2020) - Big thank you and virtual hugs to my buddy @koolrebecca and her lovely hubs Dennis Kool and family for their lovely wreath and beautifully written and heartwarming words of condolence. Dear Grandma lived a long, fruitful and meaningful life; and shall be greatly missed by all. I won't ever be able to cook for her again; but I take comfort that she'll be with her beloved husband, dear Grandpa, whom she has pined for, for almost 4 decades since his passing. True love never dies.
