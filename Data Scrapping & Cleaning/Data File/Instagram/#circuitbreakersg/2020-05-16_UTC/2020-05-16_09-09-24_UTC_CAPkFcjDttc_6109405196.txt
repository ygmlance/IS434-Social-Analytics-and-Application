Layered kuehs have always been perplexing for me. I can handle layered sponge cakes with cream I think, but setting custard over cooked rice is more intimidating. For kueh salat, the custard layer needs to be smooth and soft, but it also needs to be able to hold its shape. For me, it should be soft like beancurd, but there should more texture to it during a bite and then melt into a nice kaya cream on the palate. It should be sweet but not overpoweringly so. The coconut rice layer should be soft but rather than have it mashed-like, I like the cooked rice grains a little more firm, with a hint of sweetness to it. Some commercially sold kueh salat do not have any blue in the rice, some are still stained  blue, but the prettiest ones I have seen are dyed to a rich almost sapphire-like blue. This was not my first attempt at making this kueh of course, but it's my first successful attempt. I realise that if I apply the same methodology to kueh-making as what I try to do at work as a doctor, it usually works I.e. there are no shortcuts for both! ðŸ“·: @xxmeaway
