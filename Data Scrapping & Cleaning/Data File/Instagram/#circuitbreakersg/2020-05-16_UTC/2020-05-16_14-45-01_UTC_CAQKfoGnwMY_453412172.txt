Took a break from cooking since it’s the weekend. Ordered some chinese takeaway from yummy palace after reading some good reviews on their codfish steamed rice in bamboo basket (飘香鳕鱼笼仔蒸饭) and chicken in pig stomach soup (招牌猪肚鸡汤). #circuitbreakersg #day40 #weekend #stayhome #chinesefood #takeaway #chickensoup #roastduck #codfish #sgeats #sgfood #sgfoodie #instasg #instafood #instafoodie #sgigfood #sgigfoodies #sgfoodlover #foodie #foodpics #foodstagram #foodlover #foodporn #f52grams #whati8today #fooddiary #foodgram #foodshare
