Lunch. #stirfried #kwayteow 
I rather enjoyed the pork filling that I made for the stuffed cheong fun so I thought that would be nice in a noodle. It was ok.

More importantly, I thought, with all this increased cooking, I should make some #crispy #friedlard #猪油渣 and use the rendered #lard in my #asiancooking 
Note the brown lumps on top of the #cilantro /#corianderleaves (again with the #coriander ). #gbd
