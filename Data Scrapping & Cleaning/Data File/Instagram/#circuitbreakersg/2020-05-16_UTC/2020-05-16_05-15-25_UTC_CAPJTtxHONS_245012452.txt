It’s Saturday Family Brunch! - Ordered delivery from @merchantroadbcm .
.
Laksa w/o Cockles. My al-dente thick bee hoon came in a separate packaging from the laksa soup base (definitely a plus here) which was punch packed with lotsa ingredients! You’ll have fishballs 😍, tau pok, fish dumplings (is that what you all called it?!?), fish cake and a half-egg!! Woot!! .
Laksa soup base was fragrant, mild spicy (great for ppl like me who can’t take too spicy!)... but of cos you can ask to add the usual chilli paste lah! 🌶

My bro had the Bak Chor Mee Pok w Chilli, he blurted out his only comment: 好吃! 👍 and proceeded to ignore me as he gobbles up the rest of his upsized noodles. The mushroom looks well-marinated and noodles on the tangy side too! 🍜
