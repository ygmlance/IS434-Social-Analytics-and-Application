Chai Tow Kway aka fried carrot cake is a very common dish I grew up with for breakfast from the hawker centers. It is actually made from rice flour, water and radish. Steam it and cut it into cubes for frying with preserved turnip, chopped garlic and eggs. It comes in variations of white or black. White one shown here goes with eggs and the black one with dark sweet sauce. Both are equally irresistible! 😋
