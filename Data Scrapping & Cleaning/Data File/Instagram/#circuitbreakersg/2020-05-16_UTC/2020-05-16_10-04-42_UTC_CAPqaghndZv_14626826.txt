Since circuit breaker started, the government has implemented rules that everyone is supposed to wear a mask 😷 when they are out of home! .

Thank you 1929 Mask for sending this mask in Navy colour over for me! 😍

1929 Mask is made mostly of microfiber and cotton with 5% spandex for stretchy comfort! 
The fabric is so stretchable that it can fit different face shapes and sizes and allow for jaw movements! 👍🏼 It is also water-repellent which means that those nasty virus-laden 🦠 droplets will roll right off! .
.
.

As it’s a cloth mask, it’s washable 🧼 and reusable, making it eco-friendly as well!
