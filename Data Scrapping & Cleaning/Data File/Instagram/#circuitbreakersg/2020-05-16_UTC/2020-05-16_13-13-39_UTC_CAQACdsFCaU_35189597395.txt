Loot received from @noahgardencentre_sg at the start of CB in April, happy to report they are all healthy and doing well 1.5 months in.
All but the baby monstera have been repotted with @therootculturist’s soilless mix and they’ve been thriving next to the NW-facing window with mostly mid-late afternoon sun. Baby monstera’s enjoying itself in 100% cocohusk, thanks to @atlasgreenie’s tip! ❤️ #pleasedontdieplants #stayhomeforsg #circuitbreakersg #sgunited #urbanjungleinthemaking #urbanjungle
