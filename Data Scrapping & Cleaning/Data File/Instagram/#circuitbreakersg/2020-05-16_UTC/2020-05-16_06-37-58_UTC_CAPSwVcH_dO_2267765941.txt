If youâ€™re having Oxtail Stew, have the best there is; Rabo de Toro or Oxtail Stew.

Many people already know that Singaporeans (or anyone either living in or even just visiting Singapore) today are literally spoilt for choice in terms of the myriad of cuisines as well as even the options within the different genre.. but if you have had ours and know of a better version of Oxtail Stew available anywhere else, please let us know so that we may go try it too, because in the last thirteen years and twelve trips to Spain, we truly have not found a better one. ðŸ˜‹
