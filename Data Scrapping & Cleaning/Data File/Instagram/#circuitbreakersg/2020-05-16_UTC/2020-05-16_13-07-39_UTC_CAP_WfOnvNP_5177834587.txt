Does anyone knows the origins of fried carrot cake or what we often called it the “chai tow kway” (菜头粿)? The origins can be traced to a chinese Teochew dish found in Chaoshan, China. It consists of cubes of radish cake stir-fried with garlic, eggs and preserved radish. It’s come in now the white and black version. I guess one of my favourite carrot cake has to be the one at Clementi Hawker Food Centre.
