Grateful for my balcony view which I took for granted for last 26 years.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This Covid-19 lockdown has made me realised the little things I already have, now become my source of joy and blessing like my health and energy despite being 63yo, my ability to help people improve their immune health, and the technologies to stay connected despite being physically separated.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Really appreciate this quote by Douglas Wood...."We cannot feel thankful and unhappy at the same time."
