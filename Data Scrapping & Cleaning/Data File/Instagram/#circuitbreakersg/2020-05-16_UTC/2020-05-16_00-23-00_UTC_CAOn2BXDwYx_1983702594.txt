Grilled Fish served with Grilled Vine Tomatoes and Grilled Pineapple 
Absolutely loved the Grilled Pineapple so fragrant and sweet! 
Recipe for Grilled Pineapple
1. Slice ripe Pineapple 
2. Spray any Vegetable Oil on to a ridged frying pan
Grill both sides for 5 mins on each side
Itâ€™s as simple as that but what amazing taste!
