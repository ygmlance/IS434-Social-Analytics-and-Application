Matcha madeleines fresh out of the oven! Angmoh kueh bahlu that don’t taste eggy. YASSS.

Chef @charlynngwee had a zoom class on making madeleines last night :3. So with freshly bought matcha powder from @greenpottea @coldstoragesg, I decided to give this a go.

Before this, I’ve not made madeleines before, and only had it once in my life.

Chef was very clear in her lesson as usual, instructions were comprehensive. Other than the fact that it was on zoom, it felt pretty much the usual as though I were in Studio M again hahaha.

Anyways back to these matcha madeleines, after a bit of experimenting with baking times, it came out pretty good! Love how green it is. Almost perfect, just gotta practice more. Mum loves it, I mean she had quite a number in 1 go, and said I can do it for CNY or festive periods.

Thanks to Chef Charlynn for her patience and guidance (legit leh I think zoom classes are tiring?), I’m gonna explore other flavour profiles :3.

If you are interested to see what Chef Charlynn has next, go check out her profile. No this isn’t a paid ad, we got a love-hate rs (she will say it’s one sided) hahahhahah, she’s just a darn good chef.
