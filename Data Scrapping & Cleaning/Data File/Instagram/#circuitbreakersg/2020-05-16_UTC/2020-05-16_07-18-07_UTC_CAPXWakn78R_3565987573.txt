This is a #latergram featuring my #dabao or #fooddelivery from #localbusiness ! Here is my order of #SarawakKoloMee from Lin Yu Mei Sarawak Koko Mee. This is from the branch in #Sengkang and not their main store in Haig Road! And it was #delish ! The #noodles were springy and firm and the #taste of the sauce and mincemeat were spot on! It was a very #satisfying #meal ! I ordered additional fried and soup #wantons . #savefnbsg #loveyourlocalsg #supportlocalsg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited
