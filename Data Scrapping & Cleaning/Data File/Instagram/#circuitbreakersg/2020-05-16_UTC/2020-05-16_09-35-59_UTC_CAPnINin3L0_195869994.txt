[20.20 May 16: Circuit Breaker Day 40] Fish soup can be an easy or difficult dish to cook.

I don't have 48 hours to cook it from scratch and I made my life slightly easier to source for quality ready stock to help me prep the meal fast.

Came across this famous Tekok Ayer Teo chew Fish Soup #FishSoupParadise on #Facebook. My very kind friend had kindly let me have a pack when she did her first order to try out. Its really flavourful (I guess they could have cooked it with sour plums, it was pretty appetizing!) Combine with my purchase of a box of Batang slices ($21 for 500g), that were so fresh, sliced thickly and soaked in brine. Perfect match with the stock!

Just add some tomatoes, seaweed, cubed tofu, some ready to eat Coral Lettuce and top with some fried shallots! Light and tasty Teochew Fish Soup at the comfort of home.

This is #Notsponsoredpost but good stuff must share. It is really good for you busy peeps out there and get some nice stock frozen in the freezer! Per litre is $3.50 and probably can feed about 4 pax. To order and enquiries: 92329219 / 91469284
