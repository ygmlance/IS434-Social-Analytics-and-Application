☕️ TEABAG & POPSICLES PAINTING 🎨
The popsicles were prepared the night before by Hu. Powdered tempera paints were mixed into warm water 💦, poured into the moulds and placed in freezer. What I had in mind was for us to paint 🎨 the northern lights but HuHa were more intrigued by the teabag and it’s pungent (they feel that way 🤣) smell to bother about northern lights. It’s a fun and engaging way for them to paint and understand that they need not use only paintbrushes 🖌 for paintings 🖼 💕
Happy playing with your little ones 💕
