Grab & go on first day out of home on 14 May after staying home all the time since 9 April. Mask on & happily collected bakes from @littlewoodentable to stock up, slowly ration & enjoy at home. Comfort food to savour one piece at a time. 😄Love the flourless chocolate cake that pairs well with filter coffee for home cafe. Thanks @littlewoodentable for the lovely healthy bakes of signature lemon drizzle Bundt cake, earl grey lavender chiffon slice, flourless chocolate cake & scones.😋🍰🍫👍❤️🌈 #foodotravels #comfortbakes #youmakemesmile #littlewoodentable #littleoasis #stayhome #staysafe #staysane #brewathome #homecafe #homebrewing #grabandgo #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #onebakeatatime #nomsnoms #refreshrechargerenew #bakestocheer #sweetdelights #coloursoffood #smellsamazing #eattasteenjoy #foodtherapy
