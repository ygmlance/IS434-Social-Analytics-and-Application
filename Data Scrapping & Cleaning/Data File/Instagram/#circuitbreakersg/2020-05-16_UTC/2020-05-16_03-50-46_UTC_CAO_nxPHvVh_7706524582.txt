Healthy looking breakfast in the 1st picture but guess what is inside the bun?? It is....... 扣肉! Lol from healthy looking buns to a super unhealthy fatty piece of meat as the filling! 🤣🤣 One of my favourite dish from @quanxiangyuan - 扣肉包! A tradition restaurant serving great food at affordable price! Would usually buy and heat it up the next day and it still taste as good!
