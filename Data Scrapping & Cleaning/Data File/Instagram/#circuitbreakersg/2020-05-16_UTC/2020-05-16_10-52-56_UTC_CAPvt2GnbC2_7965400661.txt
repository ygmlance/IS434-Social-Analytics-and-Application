Here is another post to show the beautiful sound of the harp from @artists_music_studio .

Simple tune of “Amazing Grace”, the sound of the harp is so therapeutic which could calm the active baby inside the belly.

Visit @artists_music_studio for more info, or visit our profile for more details about the harp. We posted a video of a 3 years old had fun plucking the strings & playing her favourite tune on the harp.
