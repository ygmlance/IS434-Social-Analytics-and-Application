🐧 PENGUINS 🐧 
It’s always a good idea 💡 when the characters from the books 📚 our little ones are reading come to life. It makes reading 📖, relating and retaining what they learn more fun. It was coincidental when we unboxed our long overdue #KiwiCo snow-themed box 📦 and we found penguins 🐧 activity. HuHa immediately dived into it and they personalised each of the penguin 🐧 representing us 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. White ball was also provided should we decide to play bowling 🎳 with our little ones (will leave that for another day) 💕
Take care and happy waddling guys 🐧
