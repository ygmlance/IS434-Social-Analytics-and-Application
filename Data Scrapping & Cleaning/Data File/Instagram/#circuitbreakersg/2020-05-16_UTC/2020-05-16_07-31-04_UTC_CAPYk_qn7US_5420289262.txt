“It’s hard to stay motivated and inspired when I cannot stop thinking of the worst nowadays. Life had been so fast-paced and I’ve felt like I’m running out of time trying to keep up. Fear and anxiety of my future had given me the excuse to procrastinate in my work and I’ve felt that my creations were not good enough to be seen. But over the past few weeks, I’m truly grateful to have the time for self-reflection, reassess my priorities and remind myself of my passion for creating. I’ve also got the time to clean out my space and found a lot of materials that inspired me to get started. And now, jumping in head first and confronting my fears, I’m sharing videos of my creative projects and picking up new skills along the way. Even though we’re living in uncertain times now, I want to keep hoping for the future.” – Deanna Rompis (@deannarompis)
