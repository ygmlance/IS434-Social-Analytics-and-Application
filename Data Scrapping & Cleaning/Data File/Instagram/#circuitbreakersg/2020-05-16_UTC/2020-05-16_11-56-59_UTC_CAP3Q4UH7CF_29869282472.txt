【Basque Burnt Cheesecake】⁣
⁣
The unmistakable unique looking Basque Burnt Cheesecake with its deeply caramelised top that challenges the concept of the perfect baked cheesecake has been on my mind for some time ever since I first laid eyes on it. And I’m glad that I finally made the time to work on this recipe. ⁣
⁣
INGREDIENTS ⁣
▫️450g cream cheese @cowheadsg ⁣
▫️100g caster sugar (I use brown sugar)⁣
▫️3 eggs in room temperature ⁣
▫️250g whipping cream ⁣
▫️20g all purpose flour ⁣
▫️1 tsp vanilla extract ⁣
⁣
INSTRUCTIONS ⁣

⁣
2️⃣Line 6” circle cake tin with 2 layers of baking paper.⁣
⁣
3️⃣Beat sugar and cream cheese together on medium until smooth.⁣
⁣
4️⃣Add eggs one at a time and beat on medium until smooth.⁣
⁣
5️⃣Add the vanilla extract and beat until just mixed.⁣
⁣
6️⃣In a seperate bowl, mix flour and 1/4 of the cream and mix until smooth. Add another 1/4 more cream, mix, and then add the rest and mix until smooth. ⁣
⁣
7️⃣Slowly pour the cream/flour mixture into the cheese mixture whilst the mixer is beating on low until mixed through. ⁣
⁣
8️⃣Pour batter in the cake tin and bake for 25-30minutes until top is dark amber and almost charred at parts but the middles still has a wobble to them when you give the pan a jiggle.⁣
⁣
9️⃣Let cool in the tin fully on a wire rack at room temperature to allow the cheesecake to set.⁣
