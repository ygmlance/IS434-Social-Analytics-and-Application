[Background story]⁣⁣
Last year, I (Serene) was moved when my elder son told me about his love for Africa. That prompted me to write a book just for him, and this is simply what it is- An illustrated children's book written with love for a little boy :)⁣⁣
⁣⁣
❤️ Why this book?⁣⁣
This book is inspired by Azel and the depth of his sincerity in his heart for Africa. His journey of finding out about Africa is lovingly chronicled in this book as I hoped that this book would spur him on to persevere in making his dream come true. It is also my wish that this book may encourage others to take steps (whether big or small) toward achieving their dreams.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
❤️ What is the story about?⁣⁣
Azel has a heart for Africa and he has a big dream. There are however many problems and he feels that the process of reaching that dream is long and difficult. There are challenges to overcome and it requires consistent effort and determination. Nevertheless, he progressed and found that the dream is achievable.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The story seeks to deliver a simple message that children are never too young to dream big and to have the growth mindset to start small. We printed a few hundred copies last year and they have since been sold out.⁣ The books were sold out last year and all proceeds (minus the printing cost of the book) were donated to Africa through World Vision Singapore as with Azel's wish.⁣⁣
