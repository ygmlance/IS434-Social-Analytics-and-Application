apple cinnamon muffins⁣⁣
⁣⁣
we bought this premix from @phoonhuat a few months ago and finally decided to bake it !! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
verdict: there were bits of apple pieces inside the premix !! the muffin was so moist inside; wasn’t very sweet either; and we added a little extra cinnamon powder - it was amazinggggg. though somehow there was a banana taste to the muffin 🤨⁣⁣
