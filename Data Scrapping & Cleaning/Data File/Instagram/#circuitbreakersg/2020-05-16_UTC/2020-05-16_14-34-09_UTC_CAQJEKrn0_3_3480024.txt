Craving Thai food so I decided to cook something special with @maggi_sg tom yam instant noodles. This recipe is really easy & so yummy. It reminds me of the tom yam fried noodles that I had eaten in Bangkok. It is a very versatile recipe too. You can use pork, beef or even plant meat instead of chicken, and add other ingredients like seafood or vegetables.

Sharing the recipe as follows.

Ingredients:
1 packet of MAGGI 2-min Tom Yam flavour noodles 
100gm minced chicken, marinated with 1 tsp soy sauce, 0.5 tsp corn starch and dash of pepper for at least half an hour 
3 big canned button mushrooms, sliced (Or can use fresh white mushrooms) 
1 garlic clove, minced
Half a red onion, sliced thinly
1 egg, beated till fluffy
1 tbsp cooking oil
0.5 tsp sugar
2 stalk spring onion, cut into small sections
Fried shallots for garnish

Steps:
1. Bring 360ml water to a boil. Blanch the noodles for 2 mins, then dish out. To stop the noodles clumping together, rinse them in cold water for 1-2 mins and drain.
Keep the seasoning packet for later. 
2. Heat up oil on medium low heat in a pan. Add onions and fry for 2 mins, then add garlic and stir fry for another min. 
3. Add sliced mushrooms and chicken. Increase heat to medium high and stir fry well to break up any meat clumps. 
4. When the meat is cooked, about 3-4 mins, add tom yam seasoning and sugar, then the noodles. Add 1 or 2 tbsp of water if too dry.
5. Add in half of the spring onion and mix well for a min. Transfer onto a serving plate.
6. Using another clean pan, drizzle a bit of oil and add beaten egg. Swirl it around till the base of the pan is covered.
7. Once the omelette is formed and lightly browned, place and wrap the omelette around the noodles.
8. Cut an opening in the middle. Garnish with spring onions and shallots before serving.
