Just to share another super easy to make cold treat that I’m sure everyone can do it at home ! ⁣
⁣
Naming it the 𝐎𝐫𝐞𝐨 𝐌𝐢𝐥𝐤 𝐈𝐜𝐞 𝐏𝐨𝐩 , What I like about making this is that I can easily find the two ingredients needed - Oreo cookies (3 in one packet) and Full Cream Milk . I also engaged my girl by getting her to help me crush the cookies . ⁣
⁣
Best part is I don’t even need to buy any ice-cream mould or ice-cream stick as I’m using the original packaging as mould and wooden chopsticks as handle . ⁣
⁣
Scroll to see my tutorial video , this Oreo Milk Ice Pop is greatly enjoyed by my girl and she can finished one all by herself ! ⁣
⁣
Thanks @william82sg for sharing in his post and this is my turn trying it . ⁣
