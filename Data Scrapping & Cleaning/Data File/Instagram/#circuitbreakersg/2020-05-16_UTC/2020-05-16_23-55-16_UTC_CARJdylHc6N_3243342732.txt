CB Day 37 - Sin Huat Seafood - Love it or hate it... Sin Huat is probably the most expensive Cze Char in the world. 😂 Despite the crazy prices, grumpy chef-owner (seems like the term to use now!😜), super long wait, crappy environment and located within the dubious red-light district of Geylang (actually I am ok with this 🤪)... this joint is still around and doing way better than others. 😅😆 He has his following.. high-end regular customers who don’t mind braving all the above negatives, just to have his food! Sin Huat must have opened during lunch time specially for him.. cos Auntie Nunung said the boot was full of boxes of crabs 🦀 when his Driver delivered to my lobby. 😂👍You can’t deny the high quality of the seafood and his culinary magic. He’s good. He sources some of the best ingredients. He created the crab beehoon dish and he’s very nice to his regulars. My Indo boss is one of them. 🤩I haven’t had Sin Huat version of crab beehoon for a long time.. and I solemnly declare that (ala SAF-style declaration) THIS is the BEST crabhoon. Original. Best ever. And I had many.. be it Long Ji (龍记) at Tiong Bahru, Ming Kee (明记) (used to be really good but standard really dropped cos chef left), Crab at Bay (蟹中宝) & 83 Seafood at MacPherson, and Red House Seafood’s 贵妃蟹 (a totally style of crab beehoon that I really like). Don’t ask me why they are all located at MacPherson.. I also donno🤣. I think these are some of the better crab beehoons around, albeit different cooking styles. When I opened the box.. I can smell the wok hei.. and the fragrance.. I can’t describe.. crab beehoon travels very well.. and the longer u keep it in the box.. the better it is as the beehoon absorbs all the goodness of the crab and gravy. HEAVENLY! The Sri Lankan crab 🦀 was big.. with crazy-sized pincers! The otah if you haven’t had.. was big, fat and juicy.. sorry that it sounded wrong 😂 but it is that good. Wowo couldn’t stop. She loves her Otah. She declared this is the best she had. 👍 The usually fussy Baby Aaron was happily munching on the beehoon without much coaxing.. Boi Boi ate most of the crab 🦀.. he’ll grow up thinking crabs are very easy to eat.. 😭😂 Thanks Bapak Boss!
