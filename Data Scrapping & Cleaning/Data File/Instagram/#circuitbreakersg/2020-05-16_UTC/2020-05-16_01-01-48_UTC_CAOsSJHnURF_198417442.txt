💖Tau Sar Pau💖

Used to crave for this huge tau sar pau that was only available in JB and grandpa will buy back from JB occasionally after his business trip. I still have not been to JB... 😅

Anyways than I found @mdmlingbakery a few years back when they first started and saw them selling these gorgeous buns! 😍 I would buy from them once a while and enjoy them during my off season. Just as good as the ones from JB and less sweet than the regular smaller ones sold in Singapore. 💓
Paired with my bitter aromatic soy Vietnam coffee. 💯🙌🏻
