Ordered the Sambal Trio (all natural, no preservatives, all that good shizzzz) from this local SG @batulesungspicecompany and made this super easy beef with beluah keluak (black nut) sambal rice recipe from their www. SO FUCKING EASY - fry the steak and then bung it into the rice cooker with coconut milk, sambal paste and anything else you might like (ie mushrooms, shredded carrots or broccoli). It smelled soooo amazing and served it with a fried egg and FYN homemade pickles. Add additional @batulesungspicecompany chilli belacan on your egg for extra ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥HIGH RECOMMEND FOR MY FYN SG HOMIES, easy breezy beautiful belacan girl ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬
