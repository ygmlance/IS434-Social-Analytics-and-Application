Today we will look at Eating God also known as 食神. People with a high percentage of Eating God are very creative, and they are those who create a trend that will wow the world. People like Michael Jackson and Steve Job are some of the typical examples of high Eating God. They love the most exquisite thing in life and will work their way to achieve what they want. They are not the jack of all trade, but instead, they are the master of that specific thing they are passionate about. That makes their thinking unique. They strike for perfection and accept nothing less. 
To some, they might be too much to handle because of their eyes for details and perfectionist mindset. They might also come across to being too flamboyant and have an extreme ego. They will have to learn to accept things when it comes to the bigger picture. 
The career that is suitable for people with high 食神 percentage is Creative Director, Designer, Celebrity, Dancer, Artist, Social Media Manager, Graphic Designer.
