Iâ€™ve been wanting to make bombolinis for the longest time but just wasnâ€™t sure if they were worth the proofing time. But itâ€™s now or never to try this time-consuming recipe. It wasnâ€™t that bad after all - dough was done in <10min (with ingredients prepped beforehand) and took under 2 hours to rise (I think the weather was too warm and it rose too quick). Cut out the rounds, let it rise for under an hour and voila, ready to fry. The recipe I found was a small quantity one - makes 6 x 2 1/2 inch bombolinis. I cut the leftover dough into odd shapes n fried them anyway - why waste right? ðŸ˜„ I just canâ€™t get the oil temp for donuts right though! Somehow they browned too much although the insides were cooked just right. Overall, love the subtle citrusy taste from the lemon zest and chewy texture. Since we can eat them right after filling, we decided to fill 2 with ice cream and it was delicious! Got Nat to try her hands at piping Nutella as well (train those fine motor skills!). This is not something I will make in small quantities in future cos of the sheer amount of oil wasted in frying the doughnutsðŸ¤£. Also, we have a really famous shop selling bombolinis near us, so will probably only consider this as a party offering ðŸ˜„. #bakingonacloud #homecooked #bombolini #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #bakingwithkids
