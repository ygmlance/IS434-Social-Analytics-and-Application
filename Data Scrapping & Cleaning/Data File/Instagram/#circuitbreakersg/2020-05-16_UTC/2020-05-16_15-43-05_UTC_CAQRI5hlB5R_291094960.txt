Golbarir Kosha Mangsho 🐐🍛 Kosha Mangsho is a traditional Bengali way of slow cooking Mutton by braising the meat without adding any water.

The word Kosha means dryish or a gravy which is quite dry in consistency. It’s a very elaborate dish requiring a long prepation and cooking process. 
Turned out to be a test of patience .....12hours for marinating ⏲and 3 hours of cooking 👨‍🍳⏳ The recipe I used is courtesy of the Golbari Restaurant, in Calcutta who have been serving this dish since 1922. A must visit institution in its own right!! #regionaltreats
