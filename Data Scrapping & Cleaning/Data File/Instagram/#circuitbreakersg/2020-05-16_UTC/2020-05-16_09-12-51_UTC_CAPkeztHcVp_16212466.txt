I realized that I've been following some sadistic foodies in IG that likes to post sinful yummy food like ORH LUAK late at night!!😂 ⁣
⁣
So I got myself a packet of frozen Korean oysters from the supermarket to whip up a plate with extras of everything in it! 🤩😋 ⁣
⁣
Also, I actually got the inspiration to make Orh Luak from a video on Youtube which I saw a few months ago. All I have to say is that it is not as difficult as it seems and the recipe works! Try la. 😄⁣
