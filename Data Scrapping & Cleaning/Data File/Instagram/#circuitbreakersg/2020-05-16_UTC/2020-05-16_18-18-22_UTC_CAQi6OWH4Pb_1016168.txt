#Circuitbreakersg day 40

It felt like a super hot Saturday. Why no rain?
Lunch was leftovers which left me really satisfied because the fridge has a little more space again! 
No wastage of food, more space in the fridge and saves me some money too. 
Dinner today : ðŸ”º Breakfast cereal with fresh blueberries & sliced bananas
