Grab & go cheese to enjoy at home. Happily bought new supply of cheese on 1st day out of home on 14 May to replenish, stock up & ration slowly to savour one piece at a time. Make my own cheese platters & pair with refreshing Gosnells London Mead for supper snacking. Thanks @thecheeseark for the cheese & mead recommendations! 😋🧀🥃😄🌈❤️👍#foodotravels #grabandgo #cheeserun #thecheeseark #savethecheese #eathecheese #eattasteenjoy #savouronepieceatatime #stayhome #staysafe #staysane #comfortfood #foodtherapy #keepcalmandcarryon #refreshrechargerenew #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #chillwithgoodcheeseathome #2020fighting #circuitbreakersg
