Roast meats look really intimidating to make but they're actually the easiest thing you can do for maximum flavour!ðŸ˜Ž .
I've been doing quite a few of them these days and they're a huge time saver.
.
All you have to do with season the slab of meat with the herbs and spices of your choice (I've got a Mexican spice rub in this one), and chuck it in the oven.
.
Throw some roasting veg (carrot, onion, leek, fennel, eggplant or zucchini) in at the end with some potatoes  and you've got a meal!
.
Because it's such a huge portion, you can also easily keep it for another meal.
.
For the first day, we ate it like fajitas with tortilla (3rd pic), and for the 2nd day, I served it with spicy black rice and roasted veg (4th pic)
.
If you're working from home during the #circuitbreaker, it's a great chance to try this out! Just prep it in the late afternoon and you'll have a meal by dinner. .
