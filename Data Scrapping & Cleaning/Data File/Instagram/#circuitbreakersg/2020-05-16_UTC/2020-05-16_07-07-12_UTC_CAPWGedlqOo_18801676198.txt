Learning goes beyond the books! This hols, mummy planned to involve @jae.explorer in more science and STEM activities! So, here's our 1st one ~ MARBLE RUN!

In this STEM project, we discuss about: ✔ how structures are built and how to ensure each of the parts of the marble run is stable
✔ the angles that allow the pom pom balls to move down the slopes
✔ gravity
✔ Problem solving 
We experienced several problems in the process & we tried different ways to solve and finally we got our marble run up! I also suggested to have a "lift" in the marble run to transport the pom pom marble up to the starting point! It was so much fun😍😍 #igsg #sgmummy #sgkid #sgparent  #sgkidsfun #invitationtoplay #stemactivities #invitationtocreate #scienceforkids ##circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg #stayhomeday40
