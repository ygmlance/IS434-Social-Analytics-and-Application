Finally managed to solve the magic cube (aka Rubik cube) first time in my life. I felt smarter thanks to CB. 
First attempt, I watched 2+ days of YouTube video, 2nd day on 0.5x speed and finally resolve it.

Second attempt, I solved it in under 2hours with the notes taken over past 2 days. 
It's a few minutes thing for most people but to me, it's considered an achievement unlocked. Hope to be able to solve it in less than 15minutes by end of CB.
