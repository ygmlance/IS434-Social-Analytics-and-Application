Cooking Competition Day and the kids at work made Bubur Cha Cha. Lots of effort, teamwork and creativity to present this dish! Everyone is a winner. 😘
Its finally the end of work week and a tiring one. The weather is really warm and I think my rashes are coming back.
Looking forward to a well deserve break.
