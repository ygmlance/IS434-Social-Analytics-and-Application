Reclining Buddha Sai Yat 📍Ayutthaya, Thailand
..
Wat Lokaya Sutha is not one of the most famous historic sites in Ayutthaya but its admirable with the giant reclining sleeping Buddha image.
..
The statue depicts the Buddha at the time of his death as he enters Nirvana. The head is resting on a lotus and at the opposite end of the body, the legs and feet overlap squarely quite similar to the one in Wat Pho, Bangkok.
