1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣Counting1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ How exciting when our little one starts showing interest in numbers! Started little J off on some basic counting by using these home made spider cards and counting sheets. I know it’s still early, but it’s useful to get him acquainted with counting and numbers! .
.
I thought it would be useful to do this using something that he is really interested in, and at the moment it is spiders! 🕸

Of course, this activity would be best paired with constant reinforcement, such as using fingers to count aloud and making such counting a part of our daily interactions so that it comes naturally and subconsciously to toddler 👶🏻

What interests your little one? 😍🌈
