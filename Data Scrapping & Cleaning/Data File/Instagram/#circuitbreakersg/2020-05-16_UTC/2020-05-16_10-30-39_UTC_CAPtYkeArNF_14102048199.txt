Borrowed a stack of Geronimo Stilton books from @nationallibrarysg for my homeschooling son this past April - so I don’t go nuts #WFHWK. Fun, simple and engaging to read, this series is perfect for young readers making the transition to chapter books.

In each story, newspaper reporter Geronimo Stilton inadvertently finds himself starring in a new adventure - and has to overcome the odds to save his tail (and sometimes, the world). Suitable for primary schoolers, this series is a fun way for confident readers to expand their growing vocabulary. Even reluctant readers will find reading a joy with the books’ colorful fonts, creative formats and wonderful illustrations!
