My family and I love banana cake! I don't necessarily enjoy eating bananas but banana cake? A slice for me please. 🍌🙋‍♀️ Baked a Gula Melaka Banana Sponge cake today. This one is the tallest I have baked yet. There was so much batter that I filled the tin quite full (about 80%). It rose nice and round above the tin and took longer than usual to bake. I had to keep checking with skewer. Thankfully after cooling, it came out tall, even though the top is more wrinkled than an old woman's sun-ravaged skin. 😂 Check out the crumbs! I had a slice, it was moist and soft, and the texture! I am satisfied. Do u like banana cake?
