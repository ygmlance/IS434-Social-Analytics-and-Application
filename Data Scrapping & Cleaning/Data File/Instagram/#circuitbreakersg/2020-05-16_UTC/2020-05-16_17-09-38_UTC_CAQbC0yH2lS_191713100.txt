My menu for Southeast Asia cuisine continues....and ended up at Indonesia

Beef Rendang is a flavorful West Sumatran dry curry that's made with beef, that's cooked together with a spice paste and coconut milk until fork-tender. It's then fried together with the remaining braising liquid until the liquid caramelizes around the beef, coating it with an insane amount of flavor.

Slow cooking of beef with the ready made rendang paste which I bought during our trip in Indo last Christmas , together with additional spices and herbs,and lots of Evaporated milk cream, these will create magical pot of goodness.

After a few hours, you’re left  with a super fragrant, savoury, melt in your mouth  Indonesia stew, with tender beef cubes coated with gorgeous creamy and spicy flavour

Just like curry, rendang tastes better overnight.
