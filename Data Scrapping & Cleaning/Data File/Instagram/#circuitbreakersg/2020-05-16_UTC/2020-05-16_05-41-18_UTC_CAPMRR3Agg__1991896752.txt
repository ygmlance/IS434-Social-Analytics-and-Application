Not that I'm bored during this CB/WFH period. Things are piling up but on weekends, i want to take time away from the screens & cook. 
Always wanted to do this Teochew Dish - Orh Nee or yam paste but thought too much effort needed. But having achieved this,  a good blender helps. Mine wasn't heavy duty & slightly overheated so the paste is not as smooth as i wished. 
Achievement Unlocked!!
