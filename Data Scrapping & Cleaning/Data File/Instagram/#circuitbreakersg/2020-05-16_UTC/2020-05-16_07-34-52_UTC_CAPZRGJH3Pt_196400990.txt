Saturday Afternoon Tea, was two types of vadai, Medu Vadai, or Soft Vadai, made from split black gram and rice, and Masala Vadai, made with channa dal, or baby chickpeas. These tasty and textural beauties were from the sister outlet of Bunga Raya Prata Hut, where the ladies of the family churn out delights like vadai, thosai and fried noodle and rice dishes. ðŸ˜‹ #meduvadai #masalavadai #southernindianfood #southernindiancuisine #indianmuslimfood #halalfoodsg #sghalalfood #bungkus #tapao #sghawkerfood #sghawkerculture #ourhawkerculture #supportlocalsg #savefnbsg #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg #eatathome
