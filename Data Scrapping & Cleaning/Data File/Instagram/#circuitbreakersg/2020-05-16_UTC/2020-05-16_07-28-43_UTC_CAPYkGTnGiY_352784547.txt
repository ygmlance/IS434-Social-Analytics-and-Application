It’s apparently #nationalchocolatechipday🍪✨or like yesterday😅 whatever it is, #chocolatecookies works for any day😋💕 was badly craving for sugar at 1pm and decided to bake some cookies with @buttermilkpantry recipe! 🍪🥰 did a few twists to the recipe to make it less sweet😊 I love that it is not your usual cookie recipe 😉 but still easy to make! And can be done without 2 hours✨ will definitely explore more cookie ideas soon 🍪 meanwhile can read up more on tips and my experience on my new WEBSITE! (Post will be up tonight!)💻 ⚠️
