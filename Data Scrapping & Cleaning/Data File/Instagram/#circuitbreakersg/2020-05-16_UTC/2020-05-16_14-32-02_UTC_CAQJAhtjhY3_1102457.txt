#CircuitBreakerSg Day 40! Back to our usual homecooked dinner. Chanced upon one of Masaâ€™s fish recipe that looks pretty simple so gave it a try. Basically just pan fried fish fillet then cooked a buttered soy sauce drizzled over. Ok lah not very fantastic but at least something different! ðŸ˜‚

1. Pan fried sea bream with buttered soy sauce 
2. Stir fry Chinese cabbage with canned braised pork ribs
3. Shi Shen Soup (#å››ç¥žæ±¤)
