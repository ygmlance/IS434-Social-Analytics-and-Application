Since the start of #circuitbreakersg, Missy A enjoys spending her time to do craftwork, coloring and imaginative play when I am working at home. ⁣
⁣
About two weeks ago, she is introduced to the Alfred book series. She loves the book’s watercolour illustrations with colouring activities that introduce and reinforces musical concepts.⁣ Shortly after, she starts her interest to write a “music book” for her Leapfrog, Violet, reading dog. 🙂❤️
