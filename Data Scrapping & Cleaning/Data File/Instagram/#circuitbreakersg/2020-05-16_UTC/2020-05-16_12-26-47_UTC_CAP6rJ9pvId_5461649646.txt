Choo Choo, here comes the train.. A #cake to celebrate a milestone for the little one.. because Covid-19, this baby boy canâ€™t have his first month baby shower and also 100 days celebration.. so the mum decided to order a cake for his 6th month.. hope the #circuitbreakersg will be lifted soon, everything back to normal, so kids can have their #birthday celebrations soon! 
This cake was made from #chocolatesponge with #homemade #raspberryjam and frosted with #buttercream.
