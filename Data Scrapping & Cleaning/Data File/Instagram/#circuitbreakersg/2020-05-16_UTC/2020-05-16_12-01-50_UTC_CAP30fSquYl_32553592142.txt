Sweat seshhh 🔥💪🏼⠀
.⠀
While staying at home, I really enjoy doing workouts, which includes whole body and last only for 20 minutes, while you sweat like being on 40 degrees somewhere outside 😅 Best feeling ever - when you finish the workout 🤪😂⠀

Here is an example of my yesterdays HIIT.⠀
I did 40 seconds (first 3 exercises), and last 2 exercises with 30 reps each, 10 seconds rest between, and 1 minute pause at the end. I did 5 rounds. 🔥⠀

Save the video for later and try for yourself ❤️ ⠀
