Steamed #codfish (one of our favourite fish ♥️)
First pic was on Monday and I realised the garlic was a bit charred . So tonight I fried the garlic a little later than the ginger and it was not as black as Monday’s 😜 
2nd video was pouring over of the #ownselfmadesauce on it after taking out from steamer tonight n to hear the husband reminiscing his mum’s cooking over the #鸡蛋汤 😜
