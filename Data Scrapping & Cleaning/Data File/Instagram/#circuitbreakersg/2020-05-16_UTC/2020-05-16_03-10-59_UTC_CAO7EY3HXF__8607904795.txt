Good Saturday morning... what a good run and also taking the opportunity to share this video with you.
.
Filmed these footage some time ago after a run (I am alone doing the exercise anyway so don't waste the effort 🤣) and finally have the time to put it up together with voice over to share.😬

The exercises (so called demonstrations) were not done to perfection 😂 but I do hope you enjoy it and continue to build up and strengthen your arm, leg and abs muscles.💪💪💪
.
Have fun doing them. Stay safe, stay healthy.👍✌
