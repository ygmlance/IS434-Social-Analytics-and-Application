A nice Saturday afternoon brunch with all the sweets - egg tarts, Japanese souffle pancakes  and coconut panna cotta. 🥞🍯 Beside the panna cotta, the other 2 🍳 dishes were made in response to a food challenge by some friends to use 🥚 as the star ingredients. *Smirks @the.canny.cola @curious_panther .
