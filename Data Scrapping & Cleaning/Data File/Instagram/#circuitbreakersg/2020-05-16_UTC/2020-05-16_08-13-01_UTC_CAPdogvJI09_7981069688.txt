Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong - Ella and Louis, 1956. Ella was a big fan of Louis Armstrong when they collaborated on this album and was in awe just being in the same studio. You wouldnâ€™t have noticed it listening to this album today. The 11 tracks were chosen by Verve founder, Norman Granz, Louis arranged it, and they were backed by the Oscar Peterson Quartet. Probably the most recognised vocal album in jazz, or even mainstream for that. #ellaandlouis was so successful they collaborated again the following year for Ella and Louis again. #ellafitzgerald #louisarmstrong #oscarpetersontrio #ververecords
