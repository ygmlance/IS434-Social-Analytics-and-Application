What’s the workout?
Dynamic Fusion Flow with Ming from FlyWith Fitness

A blended cardio workout that combines the best of pilates, yoga, aerobics and even barre, all done with great music! Get ready to sweat it out by flowing seamlessly through the various blended movement modalities + get a good sweat after each body segment, with HIIT inspired movements we call Boost - where the 'high intensity' portion of it is optional.

Equipment needed:
1) Have a mat
2) A set of light weights at least 0.5-1kg if not have x2 1.5l water bottles or any bottle that holds liquid (pasta sauce, ketchup etc)
3) A dining chair with a back rest
