🎯 NERF TARGET-SHOOTING 🎯
⚠️ Always supervise our little ones at all times ⚠️ When Hu asked for a nerf gun 🔫 it took me a while to contemplate and finally agree to it👌🏼. I often do that since much thought goes into engaging and choosing their toys especially since I’m not a big fan of plastic toys.
I had my reservations on my little ones holding guns 🔫 even if it’s just a toy. But I also know it’s one hell of a great feeling to be able to focus, empty the mind, aim and hit the target. Better still when it hits bullseye 🎯 
The years I was in the air rifle club taught me just that. I would love to share and experience all that with my little ones once they are slightly older 💕 
For now we will have fun with not 1 but 3 guns 🔫 because umi wants to shoot too 🤣💕 HuHa were beyond elated when they saw the guns. This shooting activity went on with in between breaks and nap for the whole day! I foresee more shooting 🔫 activities with them. Even Ha enjoyed her many rounds of shooting. We had our hits and misses but the more we practise on our zeroing the better we'll get 😉💕
