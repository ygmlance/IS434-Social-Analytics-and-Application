❤️ ALL IN A DAY'S PLAY ❤️
Hello hello everyone 👋 
Hope you guys are having a SANE week ahead. Hang in there ok 😍
Come and join us for some easy and engaging activities. 🎇 LETS HAVE FUN 🎇 .

Maybe Hu sensed it was the 10th (official Mother’s Day in my country 🇸🇬) and surprised me with his colour sorting skills. Once HuHa were done with that, it was doodling time for them and we ended our play with counting in Mandarin Chinese (not our native language hence the awkward looking strokes but we make do with it) highly requested by Hu since he learns that in school 🏫 💕
HuHa sure had an engaging fun time and I hope you and your little ones too had a blast together. Take care and stay safe 💕
