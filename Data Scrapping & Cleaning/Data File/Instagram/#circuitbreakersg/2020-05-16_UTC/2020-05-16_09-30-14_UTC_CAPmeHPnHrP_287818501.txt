What a blissful Saturday, waking up to free durians from our friend, belated Mother's day cake from my niece @eldolalala for mummy n me and kueh kueh left on our front door by our friend for mummy. 
Thanks for thinking of my family and all your 爱心delivery during this circuit breaker. 
Your love and support is greatly appreciated.
