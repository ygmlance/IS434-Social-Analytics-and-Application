👨🏻‍🍳 COOKERY 👩🏻‍🍳
Don’t we just love this open-ended play that keeps our little ones engaged for hours! 💕
What’s cooking today my little chefs 👨🏻‍🍳👩🏻‍🍳?
It’s none other than our rainbow 🌈 beans topping clay pizzas 🍕 👏 🎇
We love our rainbow 🌈 beans so much not just for its vibrant colours 🌈 but the many ways we can play with it. In between of cooking 🥘, Hu had fun scooping and colour sorting the rainbow 🌈 beans. It was a great sensory and motor skills play for Ha too who enjoyed scooping the rainbow 🌈 beans into the bowls 💕
And I sure had fun watching the rainbow 🌈 beans filling up the floor and other parts of the house 🏠 🤣💕
