Hello makkale. Another saturday. Another lunch. Not that other days are any different ever since this #circuitbreakersg started. But just to bring about a feeling of normalcy in our lives, i stick to our routine that existed before all this madness began.
Lunch platter today has -
🐝Puris.
🐝Sago vermicelli kheer.
🐝Coconut milk pulao.
🐝Curd rice with pomegranate pearls.
🐝Vegetable saagu.
🐝Onion raita.
The kitchen has been cleaned up too. So now the whole day is for myself. Because dinner is taken care of, as well. We are watching a beautiful Malayalam movie. Once this s over, a nap is in order. 😉😉
