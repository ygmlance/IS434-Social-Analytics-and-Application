My first accomplishment in bread baking without yeast. ✌️ Because it’s the mum’s birthday tomorrow and she’s requested for oxtail stew so here goes: a 4hr simmered stew to go along with the home-baked walnut n oats bread. And some lemonade strawberries n white choc cake n some muffins to boot. I don’t really have a sweet tooth (give me savory anytime) but since it’s for a special occasion, hope this is right up her alley.
