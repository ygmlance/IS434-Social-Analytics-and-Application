McSpicy & McNuggets | 麦辣鸡腿汉堡 & 麦块鸡｜

Before McD SG reopened, everyone has cravings for McD including me! 🙋🏻‍♀️ And there was a lot of hype going around these two replicas!

McSpicy Replica
Brand: Fried Boneless Chicken Thigh
Price: SGD 9/ 800g

We bought the non-spicy one. 
Verdict: I won’t say it tastes like McSpicy (obviously because we got the non-spicy ones) but but but, the crunch is different too.  Still, it is still a very juicy chicken thigh patty! We’re scoring this a 3.5 out of 5! Can totally cheat a Nasi Lemak with Fried Chicken using this! .

McNuggets Replica
Brand: Freezepak
Price: SGD 7.95/ 1kg
.
Verdict: This!!!! I must say, it is damn close to McNuggets la! 🙌🏻🙌🏻 Scoring a 4 out of 5! While it’s not 100% the same, also because it is missing the Curry/ BBQ/ Sweet&Sour Sauce 🤭🤭 but for the value & taste of this, we are convinced. We’re definitely gonna be a repeat customer! .
.
But hor, I still love my McDonald’s!! @mcdsg Cannot be replaced. Ordered McD the very next day when they reopened! 😂

Burger has been our weekly must-do for lunch. Because it is easy & quick! .
