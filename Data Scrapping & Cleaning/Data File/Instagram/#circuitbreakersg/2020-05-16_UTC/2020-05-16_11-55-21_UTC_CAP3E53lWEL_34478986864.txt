Tonight's was a slightly lighter dinner, as we already had McDs for lunch and so weren't as hungry (once a week we "cheat" on our #onemealaday rule). This beautifully-presented meal is from @sushi_delivery_koedo, in Orchid Hotel Tanjong Pagar. We had their Ginza Sushi Platter (with an extra uni gunkan), Salmon Oyako Don, and Chawanmushi. Simple, fresh and very satisfying! üç£ Ordered via @deliveroo_sg. Dessert up next!
