Things to do with the kids #57

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Either you open the door and let me out, or let me sleep." "It's past 9pm, so the door is closed." "That is a stupid rule." "Well, life is full of stupid rules, and sometimes, you just need to suck it up, Titus." "Are you offering food, by any chance?" "Oh, Titus, you and your stomach." "Vanilla, where did you come from? I was talking to Mum." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
