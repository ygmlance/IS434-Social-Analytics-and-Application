Never have I imagined that the world would be what it is today. The streets are empty, homes become the new prisons and the planes are no longer flying in those blue skies. ✈️But everything is for a greater good, right? We are doing our part to help our friends fighting for others’ lives in the frontline. 👩🏻‍⚕️👨🏻‍⚕️We are giving nature time to reset and grow into something more beautiful than ever. 🌳🌻We are spending more time with the people under the same roof as us. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧There’s always a good in everything if you are searching. 🌦Have you been searching?
