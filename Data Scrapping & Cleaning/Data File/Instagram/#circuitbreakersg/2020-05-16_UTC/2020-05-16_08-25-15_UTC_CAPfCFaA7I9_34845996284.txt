Yam rice ◎ smart/rice cooker version

On the day that I don’t have much time cooking, I will go for ‘all-in-one-pot’. Yam rice is one of my favorites. I use smart cooker here but rice cooker is fine.

Ingredients: 
yam from @greenies.sg (It’s cut nicely in cube and packed in vacuum. Love the convenience)
200g pork (I use pork shoulder here)
10 pieces dried mushroom soak in water for overnight ⚠️ Do not discard the water from soaked mushroom because it can be added into rice as added flavor
Chopped shallots and minced garlic

❶ Cut pork into slices and marinate with corn flour, pepper and 1 tablespoon of soya sauce
❷ Cut mushroom into slices and marinate with a bit of sesame oil and 1 teaspoon of soya sauce
❸ Heat up oil in smart cooker and fried shallots until slightly brownish
❹ Add minced garlic and marinated pork. Stir fry until pork is 80% cooked
❺ Add yam and water from soak mushroom then continue to fry to mix well. Add 1 teaspoon of salt
❻ Add rice and mix well
❼ Add about 200mL of water and 1 tablespoon of black soya sauce and soya sauce each. Make sure the water level covers all the rice
❽ Put on rice mode and ready to serve when cooking complete
