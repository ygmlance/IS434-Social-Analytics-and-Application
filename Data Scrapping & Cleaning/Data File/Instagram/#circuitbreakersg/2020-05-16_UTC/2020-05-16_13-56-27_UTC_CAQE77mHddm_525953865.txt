One good thing about the #circuitbreakersg is that I spend more time playing guitar now. Swipe to hear a simple solo I did for a @marcnair piece.

The solo is played over a simple I-vi-V-I loop. My only electric guitar now is an @oniguitars 8 string with fanned 25.5-27.5 scalloped frets. It’s loaded with @instrumentalpickups - can’t remember what- but I have really enjoyed the feel and tones from this setup. I usually plug into an iPad running GarageBand or Cubase, and this clip has @klevgrand’s STARK performing amp simulator duties.
