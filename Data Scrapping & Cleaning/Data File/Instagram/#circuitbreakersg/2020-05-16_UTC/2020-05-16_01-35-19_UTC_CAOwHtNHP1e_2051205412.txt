15 May | Make Math Home Learning Fun!
.
The thought of home-based learning used to exasperate me especially when I have an active 5 year old who doesn’t seem to process information the tried and tested way. When I see other kids his age already leaps and bounds ahead in their academic developments, and my own son frowns at Math, I honestly was very discouraged.😔
.
The good folks at @tickleyoursenses have been following my IG. When the #CircuitBreaker was extended, they very generously sent us this Early Math 101 Number & Measurement Set and told me to try using it to ignite Buddy’s mathematical sense.
.
This week, Daddy is home and we started using this treasure trove of activities to play with Buddy. We did measurement by units and simple additions but there are still so many activities we can use to build Buddy’s arithmetic skills.
.
This Level 3 Kit is designed for 5-6 year olds. Parents can spend quality time with children as they learn number sense, geometry and logical thinking. Each kit contains high quality manipulatives, activity cards & activities.
.
This multi-faceted Early Math 101 Level 3 Number & Measurement set includes:
⏏️74 Number Rods & guidebook
⏏️19 Place Value Trains
⏏️1 set of school friendly play cards
⏏️Snakes & Ladders Game
⏏️Number Board with Block Window Strips
⏏️40 Transparent counters
⏏️5 Number Trains
⏏️2 10 sided Jumbo Place Value Dice
⏏️Activity Guide
.
All resources are packaged in a hand carry plastic case for easy storage & transport. @tickleyoursenses also sells Early Maths 101 Kits (Levels 1 and 2 for younger kids). I’m eyeing their geometry and puzzles set next as we also want to help strengthen his problem-solving skills.
