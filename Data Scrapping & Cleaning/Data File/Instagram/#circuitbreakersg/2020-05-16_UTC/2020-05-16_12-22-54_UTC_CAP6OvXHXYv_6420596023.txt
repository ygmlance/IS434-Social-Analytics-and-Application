‚Ä¢RECIPE‚Ä¢ I am not a fan of Oyakodon but CB forces me to find simple recipes cos I am getting tired of cooking. This three ingredients recipe surprised me! It's sooo simple and yummy the hubb says I can sell it üòÅ. I don't have dashi broth so I replaced with just more condiments. ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
‚Ä¢ 2 chicken drumsticks, deboned
‚Ä¢ 3 eggs
‚Ä¢ 1 onion, sliced thinly
‚Ä¢ 2 tsp mirin
‚Ä¢ 2 tsp soy sauce
‚Ä¢ 1 tsp sugar
‚Ä¢ 1 tbsp abalone sauce (to replace dashi) ‚Ä¢ 1/2 cup water

METHOD:
1) Wash and pat dry chicken. Rub some sea salt and pepper on both side and leave for at least half an hour
2) Add in 1 tbsp oil and fry the chicken with skin facing UP over medium heat. Cover with a lid to prevent splattering. Fry till golden brown. 
3) Turn the chicken over with skin faces down. Let it cook over medium heat for another 3 minutes or til skin turned crispy brown
4) Remove and cut into 1 inch cube size. 
5) In the same pan, add the Sliced onion and fry till fragrant. 
6)Add in the rest of the condiment and water and bring to boil over low heat. 
7) Add in the chicken cubes and let it simmer till the chicken is fully cooked.
8) Add in the beaten eggs gently over the broth. Cover and simmer for about 30 seconds. Make sure the eggs are not overcooked.
9) Drizzle the egg and chicken over the rice and serve hot. ============================================================ #oyakodon #chicken #japanesefood #15minutemeals #15minutesrecipe #simple #sgig #sgrecipes #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodstep #instagfoodsg #singaporehomecooks #homecookedmeals #whati8today #instagfoodsg #ÂÆ∂Â∏∏‰æøÈ•≠ #sgfoodlover #onepotmeal #comfortfoods #circuitbreakersg
