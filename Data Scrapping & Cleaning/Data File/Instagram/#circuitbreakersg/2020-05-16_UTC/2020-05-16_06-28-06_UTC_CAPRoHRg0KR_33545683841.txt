. This looks like a giant croissant to me. ðŸ˜‚ This is loaf 1 to hit the oven this morning. 
The bakes from these 2 days have produced way many crazy big holes in the crumb. Guess itâ€™s time to down the dough size from 1kg in order for longer hand mix.

Multi seeded boule, second loaf from this morning bake. 
40% AP Flour
15% Levain (wholemeal % rye)
10% Salt
80% Hydration
11 hours fermentation
