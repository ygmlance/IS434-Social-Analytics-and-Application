Wait... Pl bear with me... Just to end off my #stayhomewithascott pledge with this last cooking post! This mini coffee tart is really yummy if you are a coffee lover like me! Btw, the coffee filling is self-invented by me! Have been doing food experiments at home and concocting own recipes. This coffee filling is simply made up of Nescaf√© coffee granules, little hot water and sugar, milk powder, butter and cornstarch! Just work on your own desired proportion of each ingredient (almost same ratio for all ingredients) until 'cake consistency' is reached. Pour the mixture over the tart shell and bake!
