I’ve never owned more sauces, condiments and baking ingredients than my whole life combined: Himalayan salt, hua diao wine, white wine, five spice powder, Worcester sauce, raw sugar, brown and white sugar, you name it, I’ve got it!

Thanks to CB (and my helper) I’ve picked up baking again, explored cooking 卤肉饭 , 咕噜肉and char siew pork amongst many others.

Two more weeks to go and try out other new foods on my list!
