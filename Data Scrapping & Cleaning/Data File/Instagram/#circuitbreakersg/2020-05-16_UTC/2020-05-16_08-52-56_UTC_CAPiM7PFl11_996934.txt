#circuitbreakerday40 // Came in to a late lunch, looking, apparently, like a tropical #GreenMan - hair full of leafy twigs with confused spiders and their webs still attached, face and arms sunburnt and dark also with branch debris, legs caked with mud or dotted with mozzie bites.

1. Actually useful #plantcuttings (clockwise from 12, circling inwards): #kaffirlime, #naibai, #sweetbasil, #indianborage, #dill, #pandanleaves, #aloevera, #nonifruit.
.
2. #mangoleaves infected with some disease.
.
3. Longan leaves infected with some other disease.
.
4. Inauthentic #gyudon with some naibai.
.
5. Thankful for vids on how to set up a #polepruner without fancy knots.

Fortunately, did not have to deal with the Oriental Whip Snake thatâ€™s been hanging near the mango tree and scaring the resident geckos (nor that ancient serpent (Genesis 3, Revelation12) either).
