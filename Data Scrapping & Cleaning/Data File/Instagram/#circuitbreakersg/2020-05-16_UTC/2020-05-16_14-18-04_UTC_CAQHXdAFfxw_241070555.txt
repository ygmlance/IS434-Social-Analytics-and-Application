#Evvirtualgamesnight is back again, and this time our team went camping and ventured off into the deep forest. Along the way we competed amongst ourselves to collect some yummy berries but bumped into BOSS CORONA. That's when we joined forces to form TEAM EAGLES to fight it. Needless to say, we managed to defeat BOSS CORONA and even got a Certification of Accomplishment for saving the world.

Thank you @jeric_koh for dropping by. Thank you to our special guests @ofjunk , @jerlene_xie , @chia.sy , @cai.xuannnn and @timwyk for joining us.

Shoutout to @melvinnnntan for stepping up to plan and execute an amazing games night for the team, and @zimah_isnin and @danihohoho for being amazing co-hosts.
