Budae Jjigae prepared by girl in celebration of her being offered medicine course in University. It has been her dream to be a doctor since young to help humanity and save lives.
.

Though also being offered Dentistry course which is even more difficult to get in than medicine, she gave up this easier path and shorter course. This covid19 has not frightened her or waver her decision to become a doctor. We are really proud of her courage and determination! Thank God for his blessings and leading her to do a course where her heart desires! .

Swipe to the last pic to see the surprise delivery that the school sprang on her yesterday. What a sweet gesture that brightens up one’s day! 😍
