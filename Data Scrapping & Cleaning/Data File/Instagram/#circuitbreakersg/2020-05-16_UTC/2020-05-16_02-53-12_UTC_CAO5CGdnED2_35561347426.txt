My imperfect, yet perfect chocolate cake. This was made yesterday and chilled in the fridge, before I follow up with cream cheese frosting today. In light of the #circuitbreakersg, I decided to bake my little pumpkin his first birthday cake! Wish me luck! 🤞🏻#sgmummy #sg #momlife #homemade #stayhome #mamasboy
