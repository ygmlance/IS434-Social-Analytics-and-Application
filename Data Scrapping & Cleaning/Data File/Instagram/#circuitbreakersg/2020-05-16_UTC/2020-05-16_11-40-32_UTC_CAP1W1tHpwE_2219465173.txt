Some of you drop me lovely messages of how you see me working out everyday and feel motivated. Never know I can make an impact in someone's life but I glad I did! I enjoy seeing everyone's workout progression in the CB and staying healthy too. I am also struggling to stay discipline with my workout routine. Like they say, the only bad workout is the one that didn't happen!

Don't wait until you've reached your goal to be proud of yourself. Be proud of every steps you take towards reaching that goal.

Here is a fast-forwarded version video of me doing Chole Ting's abs workout yesterday. This was just a part of the YouTube workout, I did the rest without filming plus some glute exercise as well. Let's stay motivated together! 💪🏻
