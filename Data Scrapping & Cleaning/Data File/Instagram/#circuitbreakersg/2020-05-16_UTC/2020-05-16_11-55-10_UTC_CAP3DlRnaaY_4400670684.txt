The last time I baked was 5 years ago (!) when I gave J some cookies to, you know, 意思意思 make a point that I won't burn down the kitchen 💁🏻‍♀️
.
Recently chanced upon a recipe that claims to replicate Subway cookies and they turned out surprisingly well in my toaster oven!
.
I omitted vanilla essence cos they're sold out everywhere, and reduced the amount of sugar by 20% but we still found them too sweet 🙃

Here's the modified choc chip cookie recipe I attempted!

Ingredients: 
125g salted butter, softened
80g brown sugar 
50g granulated sugar
1 egg
150g plain flour
1⁄2 tsp baking soda
200g dark chocolate, roughly chopped

Step 1. Mix the softened butter and sugar in a bowl, then add in egg and stir.

Step 2. Sift in flour and baking powder and mix well, before adding in the chopped up chocolate.

Step 3. Chill cookie dough for about 10 mins in the fridge.

Step 4. Preheat oven to 175°C and lightly grease baking sheet

Step 5. Roll chilled dough, place them about 2 inches apart and bake for about 12 mins. Let them cool and enjoy! 🍪
