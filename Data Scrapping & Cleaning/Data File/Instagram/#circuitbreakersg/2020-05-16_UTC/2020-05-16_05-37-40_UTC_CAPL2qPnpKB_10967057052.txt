As of 14 April 2020,  it is mandatory for all persons to wear a mask when leaving their home. For parents, it can be difficult to get the kids to wear mask.
.
Experts said part of what makes masks scary for children is their loved ones arenâ€™t always recognizable with part of their faces covered. They read all their cues for safety from our faces, so itâ€™s important that we make them familiar with it in a comfortable playful way.
.Letâ€™s start decorating and have fun with the little ones. Do it twogether! ðŸ˜‰
