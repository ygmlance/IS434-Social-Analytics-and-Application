Started this Monday very optimistic about my intermittent fast. Ending the Monday with fruit, boiled eggs, crisps, glass of sake and a huge craving for @being1ton wonton mee.
.
Some smokey sweet Char Siew, that balances out the heat of the spicy noodles, and lots of wontons. Plump boiled ones dunked into the tasty, if slightly sweet, soup (piping hot, fragrant with ginger and scallions); and crispy fried ones dunked into mayonnaise (next time hold the â€˜truffleâ€™ flavouring pls). But what I really enjoyed about the experience was the responsiveness and excellent customer service of Ray, my the noodle â€˜mailmanâ€™, who was kind enough to squeeze in my order even though they tell to book a day in advance if possible. Good man!
