I’m starting to love this can-lie-down-immediately work setup, esp after a Saturday morning coaching session.⁣
⁣
I usually only wake up at noon on weekends (haha).⁣
CB has blurred working hours, weekdays & weekends, personal & professional boundaries etc.⁣
⁣
But hey, thankful to be working, thankful for a new (excitingly prolific) client, and thankful to be still able to do what I do best, even remotely.⁣
⁣
Happy CB weekend all!⁣
