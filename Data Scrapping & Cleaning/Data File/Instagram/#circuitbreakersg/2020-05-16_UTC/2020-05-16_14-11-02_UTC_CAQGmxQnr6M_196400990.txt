It’s World Whisky Day, so i poured myself a stiff one to celebrate! I picked up this bottle on a visit to the Kavalan facility at King Car Distillery outside of Yilan City, in the Northeastern part of Taiwan on 13 June 2015, just a couple of months after it won the “World’s Best Single Malt” at Whisky Magazine’s annual World Whiskies Awards 2015. Kavalan, “Solist “, Vinho Barrique, Single Cask Strength, Single Malt Whisky, Taiwan. Cask No. W091120017B, Bottle 125/198, Bottled on 02/06/2015. Deep, reddish amber in colour, with red berries, dried apricots, white chocolate and caramel on the nose. On the palate, almost sweet, with an almost oily texture, but lots of heat and almost peppery spice notes, and a not so long finish. I like mine with ice, to tone down the fire! 😅 #kingcardistillery #kavalan #kavalanwhisky #kavalansolist #singlemaltwhisky #singlemalt #taiwanesewhisky #ontherocks #worldwhiskyday #saturdaynightdrinks #drinkathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
