| Bonsai Beach | 
Feeling stressed up lately? Why not make a trip to Bonsai Beach where sunsets are perfect every evening. Grab a seat atop the sturdy branch on any of our lovely Bonsai trees and enjoy the view. ðŸŒ¿ ðŸŒ…

Close your eyes as you listen to therapeutic roar of the rolling waves. Feel rejuvenated as the ocean spray lands upon your face. ðŸŒŠðŸ˜Œ But be careful and watch you balance! You don't want to fall off as there are no lifeguards in Bonsai Beach.ðŸ¤­

Btw this isn't a real Bonsai tree. It was a dill plant that my dad re-potted from his garden but he keeps calling it his bonsai. LOL. 
Scroll for BTS! Ocean created by aluminium foil.
