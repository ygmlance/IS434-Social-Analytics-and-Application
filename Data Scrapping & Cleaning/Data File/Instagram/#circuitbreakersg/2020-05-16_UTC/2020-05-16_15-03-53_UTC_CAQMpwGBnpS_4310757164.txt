😋🍝 To grind, add a handful of coriander leaves, chunk of ginger, nutritional yeast, handful of cashews, dried chillies(for that hotness). Then in the pan add olive oil, sliced onions and whatever the veggies you have in hand( I added Zucchini, peas and broccoli 🥦). Once veggies are cooked add the grinder paste along with cooked pasta. Serve it with vegan parmesan cheese.
