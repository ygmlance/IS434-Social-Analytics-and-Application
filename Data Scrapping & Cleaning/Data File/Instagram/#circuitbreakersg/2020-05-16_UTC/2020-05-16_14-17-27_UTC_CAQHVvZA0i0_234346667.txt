【Recipe】Catching up with some work and also did some house cleaning today. Busy but happy that I ended the day with this delicious homemade dessert. Spongy soft Chocolate banana chiffon with fresh whipped cream & mascarpone, topped with fresh berries. So yummy! #honeybeesweetscakebakes 
Basic yet amazing, just the way I like it. Even better with berries and lightly sweetened cream. 
Sharing the recipe below. Bare in mind my cakes are less sweet then usual, so feel free to adjust to your liking. #honeybeebakesbananachocolatechiffon
