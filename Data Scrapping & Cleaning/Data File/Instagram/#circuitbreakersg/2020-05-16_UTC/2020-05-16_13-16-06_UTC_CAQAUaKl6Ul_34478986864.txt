Final post for tonight, cakes from @ladymsg! We had their green tea #millecrepe and strawberry shortcake.  I don't have a sweet tooth, in fact I  rarely crave desserts. However, the first time I had the #LadyM Millecrepe in NYC, I exclaimed that it was "exquisite", and still stand by my word today ðŸ˜† Ordered via @deliveroo_sg in the afternoon, as they do run out by evening time.
