Presenting to you...our very first Shake Shack!! We’ve passed by Shake Shack many times overseas and even when it first arrived in S’pore, we didn’t had the strong urge to jump into the queue for it🥱Since we were craving badly for some beef burgers, decide to grab ourselves some and see what’s hype all about!!🍔🍟🥤Since Shake Shack has pivoted itself as a fine casual restaurant as opposed to the regular fast food joints, we would say that the beef patties definitely taste more premium and those potato buns - wow fluffy and buttery🤤 Initially, we shied away from the Shroom Burger as it’s a whole deep fried portobello, imagining that it’ll taste really greasy. But glad that we gave this popular burger a shot, the mushrooms really gave this earthy flavour and meaty texture, mimicking the beef patties. For the shake, it is simply way too sweet for two person to finish let alone one person (gets jelat real fast) and we’ll probably also give the fries a miss in the future🙃
