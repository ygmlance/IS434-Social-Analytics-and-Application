The past couple of days, especially today’s heat was borderline unbearable. And it made me so irritable! 🥵
.
With #sharkweek, abdominal cramps, hormonal surges, heightened sensitivity and raised core temperature - gosh it is almost the worse combination ever. I tried to stay away as much as possible or retreat to my own Zen Den whenever i could
.
We had new furniture coming in this week and the family’s books are now housed there. Well, not all, yet.. as some are still packed away or loaned out. So hopefully we will have enough space lol
.
S’ chosen activity today was ballet - I guess she does miss her lessons quite a bit and dressed up in her pink leotard for the YouTube session. She couldn’t locate her skirt so wore her rainbow pouffy one instead 🌈🌈
.
For me, since I was already perspiring from the sweltering heat at 9ish in the morning, I decided to might as well attempt the #f45STAR #f45hollywood session 🤷🏻‍♀️ seriously it was worth it being out there for an hour to finish two laps of 27 exercises. I felt more refreshed & energised after.

Join me for a free session ok? Let me know if you’re keen and I’ll send you a link ❤️ #fitness #Sgfitness #fitfam #fitnessmotivation #fitnessjourney

Hopefully this #circuitbreaker has been going well for you! Some businesses and services are in operation now but it really doesn’t mean that we go out in masses to get things done. We just need to practice more control and vigilance still, and #stayhome as much as possible till we get clarity and more good news.
