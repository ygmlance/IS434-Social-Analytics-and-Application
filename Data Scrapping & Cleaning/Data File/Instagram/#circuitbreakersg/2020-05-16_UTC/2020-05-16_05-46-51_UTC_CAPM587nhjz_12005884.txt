Fry tanghoon for lunch. Finally got a slot today to cook my favorite dish. Trying to keep the ingredients minimum but ended up still a lot. A little bit of cabbage, carrot, chinese mushroom, black fungus, eggs, mince pork and prawns ONLY! Have a good weekend! Counting down to the end of circuit breaker, 2 more weeks to go! CBDay40!
