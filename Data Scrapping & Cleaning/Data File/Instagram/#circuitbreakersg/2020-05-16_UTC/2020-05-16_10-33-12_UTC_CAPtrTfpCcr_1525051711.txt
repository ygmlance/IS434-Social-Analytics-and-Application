Coronavirus is such a strong wake-up and I seriously want to continue the lessons learnt (and still learning) from this period 😇
.
Personal hygiene and cleanliness n sanitisation at home was always important but now it's of paramount importance and that's where gadgets like @ruhenssg 's latest WCE-200 Water Electrolyser make things super convenient for busy moms like us 🤗

. 💧 It is a convenient, eco-friendly home steriliser that can remove 99% germs, bacteria, and bad odour. .
💧 It allows me to make my own electrolytic water with sterilising properties to clean almost anything and everything.
.
💧 With just water and salt, this electrolytic liquid is created. The steps are so simple that even kids can do and it's FAST!
.
💧 I use it to clean furniture, appliances, clothes, shoes, as well as to sanitise hands, remove odour from refrigerator, shoe cabinets and more. Wow, it's so multi-purpose.
.
💧 I also use it to clean Shrihaan's toys, Eeshaa's stationery and their cupboards.
.
💧 Looks sleek and makes a good addition to your #homedecor
.
My verdict? Indeed an innovative gadget and definitely worth-getting one for your sweet home because we all have to stay safe and vigilant as we prepare to come out of #circuitbreakersg 💚
