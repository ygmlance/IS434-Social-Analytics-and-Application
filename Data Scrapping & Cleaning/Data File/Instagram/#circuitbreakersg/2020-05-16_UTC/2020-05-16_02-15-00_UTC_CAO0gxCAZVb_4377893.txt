It’s Day no. ‘I don’t even know anymore’ of the #CircuitBreaker & while I do miss being able to go out for meals and having family gatherings, I'm also thankful that I now have more time at home to spend with Ahlao and especially Gooby. He's definitely enjoying all the extra cuddles, treats, and TV time together! 🐶💕⁣

As much as it is difficult for us to suspend all our social gatherings for now, let's remember to be grateful for more time with the people at home, cos we are #HomeButNotAloneSG! ⁣

Also would like to say a huge THANK YOU to our healthcare workers for fighting this very difficult war at the frontlines. It was disheartening to see the total number of cases rising everyday but thankfully community spread numbers are going down! But this does not mean we can be complacent; while we look forward to better days, please, continue to #StayHomeForSG! Only together, we can overcome this ❤️⁣

I am donating to The Courage Fund, which provides relief for those affected by the Covid-19. Here's the link if you would like to donate as well 😌 #SGUnited #WeAreMajulah
