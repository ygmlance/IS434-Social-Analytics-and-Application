Flower-Making üåº
‚Å£
This is not a tutorial; just something that I happened to do for kicks. I keep beer bottle caps for grip strength training, and realised that the bent caps look like flower petals. So I decided to try and bend 4 caps with different fingers to complete a 7-petalled "bloom" in 60 seconds.

I made the "flower" but failed to stay within the 1-minute mark lol. Was probably too perfectionist trying to squeeze a couple of stubborn caps tighter than I could. That's why the video is at 2x the actual speed haha.

If you drink beer like me, don't toss the caps! Literally squeeze them for what they're worth. Be careful when you're new to this or have wet hands though; you could sustain some pretty nasty cuts. But apart from that this is a good strength builder and a cool party trick üí™üèº ‚Å£
