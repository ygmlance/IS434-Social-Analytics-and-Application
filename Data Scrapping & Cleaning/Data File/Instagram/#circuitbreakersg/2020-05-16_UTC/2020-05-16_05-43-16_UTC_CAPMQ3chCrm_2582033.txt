Ketam masak Beras Goreng ! 
If I could only eat just one curry for the rest of my life, I want it to be this. A unique curry cooked with ‘Fried Rice’ powder taste so good, that it makes you do a happy dance, sing its praises and forget all that hard work of cracking the claws and crab shells to get to the good stuff!
A sentimental recipe from my late Mother in law but modified with good “Tampering “ in the end makes this dish even hard to resist ! 
Try it and comment after you have tasted it ! 
I promise you gonna love it too ! 
Get the recipe !
