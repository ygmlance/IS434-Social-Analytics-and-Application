I was looking at our last year Japan photos today. Then, it hit me that it was on this Narita Express (N'EX), this photo, where we were saying that we'll be back again in Japan at around this time (now). I thought this photo totally depicts how I feel about everything now.

Is it the same for you? @jacey_lyy
