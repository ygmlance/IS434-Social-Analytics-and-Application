Super hot and humid afternoon!! Locked #thekayas in the other room while me and #thesushidad take a power 10mins nap back in our room🥱😴

#tonightsdinner is a simple affair. Using Spring Home Prata again as base and cover for my easy Chicken Pot Pie, and Campbell Mushroom canned soup as the creamy base. Added additional potato and chicken cubes too😋😋😋
