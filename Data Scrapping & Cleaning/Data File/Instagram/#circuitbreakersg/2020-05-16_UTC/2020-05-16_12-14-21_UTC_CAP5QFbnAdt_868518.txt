Morning date with kimchi! 
Making this banchan for the first time and I must say it is rather laborious (no wonder the price tagðŸ˜…). Went to pull the man out of bed to help out. Kimchi-making is a family activity anyway.ðŸ˜„ #newventure #feelingaccomplished #ustime #weekend #saturday #naturalfermentation #fermentingkimchi #homemadekimchi #kimchimaking #kimchi #ê¹€ì¹˜ #banchan #ë°˜ì°¬ #goyangicookdiary #maangchi
