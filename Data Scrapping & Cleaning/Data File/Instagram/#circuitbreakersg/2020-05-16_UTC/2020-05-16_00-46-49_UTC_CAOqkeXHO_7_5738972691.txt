Morning guys excited to show you guys this launch!  Not sure if you remembered I featured the design process of these on my stories!  With my sons help (colouring ðŸ¤£) we thought up of these designs and also colour.  Had a great time making these and hopefully you guys will like it too.  Will post up some close ups as soon as I get round to doing it ðŸ¥°

Launch date 22nd May, 8pm SG time so do set yourself a reminder hehe

Have a great weekend ahead and stay safe. .
