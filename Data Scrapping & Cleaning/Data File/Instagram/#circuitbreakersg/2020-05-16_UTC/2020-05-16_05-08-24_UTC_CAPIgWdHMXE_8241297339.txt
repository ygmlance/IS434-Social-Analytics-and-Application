Lunch was simple comforting soup and rice made from leftovers. Threw leftover tikka masala chicken sauce into homemade chicken stock with some celery, carrots and cauliflower for crunch. The result was a rich umami soup base with spicy tomato flavor and a hint of ginger.  Made the tikka masala chicken and chicken stock in the Instant Pot. #whattocooknext #stayhomestaysafe
