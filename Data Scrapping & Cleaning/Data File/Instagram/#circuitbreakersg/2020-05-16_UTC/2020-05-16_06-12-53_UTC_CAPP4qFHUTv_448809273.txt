Tired of ordering and getting the wrong size when you buy something online? Fret not.
My name is Justine, I am a co-founder of Chaloné lingerie for 20 years. Starting as the first Lingerie Consultant of Chaloné, I was trained with world renowned French lingerie labels and fitted thousands of women who are ardent Chaloné followers. 
Recently, due to the ongoing circuit breaker, many customers contacted me to help in finding bras and any lingerie solutions. With the lack of qualified help online just through the website, I had to personalise this distance fitting experience, by listening to their needs and understanding their bodies through innovatively constructed questions.

I understood their frustrations, having experienced some of the same issues first-hand, even with my knowledge on lingerie. 
That’s when the hassle-free concept of Chaloné Virtual Fit was born where I provide expert bra-fitting in the privacy and comfort of your home. We can have these consultations online or over the phone,  completely free of charge, any day.

Try this service experience now. I look forward to working with you soon!#stayhome #circuitbreakersg #buybra #lingerie #bra #shoponline #onlineshopping #shoplocal #shopathome #brafitting #realsexychalone
