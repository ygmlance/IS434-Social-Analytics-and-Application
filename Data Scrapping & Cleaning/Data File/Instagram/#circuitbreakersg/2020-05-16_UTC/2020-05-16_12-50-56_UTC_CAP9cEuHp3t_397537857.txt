#CircuitBreakerSG D-40

Left with a small slab of Pork Belly, so I made the family's favourite Caramelized Pork with Tau Kwa. The Pork Belly was braised with both light & dark Soya Sauce & water for about 30-45 mins to tenderise it. Stir fry the Pork to render the fats, add Onion, Spring Onion (white part) & pan-fried Tau Kwa. Sweeten with some sugar and add the green part of the spring onion.

Next dish is Salted Egg Bittergourd. We had this in Indonesia years ago & fell in love at first bite. I've cooked this several times using the whole salted egg yolk and this is the first time I'm using Salted Egg Powder from @EmakuIndonesia. And yes, we totally love it. Have you tried this dish before?

Lastly, baby Kailan cooked with Mushroom.

Enjoy your weekend dinner too!
