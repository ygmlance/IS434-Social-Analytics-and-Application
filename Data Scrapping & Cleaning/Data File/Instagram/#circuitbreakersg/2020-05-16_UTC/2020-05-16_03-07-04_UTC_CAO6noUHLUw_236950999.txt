One of my favourite one dish meals to make is Pumpkin n Yam fried rice #妈妈的味道
The yam that I’m using today is so good, fluffy in texture n the pumpkin is very sweet, both give the natural sweetness to the dish. Yumms .

Joining the fun with @homemadeloversss for today’s theme “Rice Creations” Thanks for hosting .
