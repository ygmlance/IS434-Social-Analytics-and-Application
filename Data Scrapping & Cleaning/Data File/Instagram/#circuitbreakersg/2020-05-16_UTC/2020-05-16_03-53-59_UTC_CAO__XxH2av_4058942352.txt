Can't wait to see you all soon! 🤩

It's been close to 6️⃣ weeks since we last open(feels like forever 😢). And hopefully there won't be any more extensions to the #circuitbreakersg
And we can resume our operation on the 2nd June. Already missing everyone now.

I have been in communication with all my patients during this period, checking in with them and also giving advices on exercises and stretches.. A lot of them have expressed that they can't wait to be back for their regular. #chiropracticadjusment.

Who here can't wait to get their adjustments? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️
