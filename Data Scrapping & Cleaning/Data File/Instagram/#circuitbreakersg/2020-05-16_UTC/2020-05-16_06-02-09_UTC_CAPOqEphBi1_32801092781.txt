Circuit breaker Day 40: Best prawn mee in SG 👍👍👍🦐 Brought my own containers for the noodle containers & sadly no one else brought theirs 😪 Everything was still good, soup flavourful & prawns fresh! But there was just something different about eating at home & not there. Just lacking that final touch of idk what. Found the ngoh hiang dishes to be on the salty side today & a tad soggy after the trip home. But it’s ok, still a very satisfying lunch!
