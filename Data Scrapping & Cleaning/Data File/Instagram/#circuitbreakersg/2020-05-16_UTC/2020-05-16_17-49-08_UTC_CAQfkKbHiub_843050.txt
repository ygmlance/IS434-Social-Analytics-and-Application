Fried up a 1-wok dinner of Garlic Prawn Noodles for Friday night dinner as we had caregroup on Zoom and I wanted to have a quick cleanup. Dinner was indeed cleared in a flash! The Hubz said itâ€™s his #2 favourite dish of mine after the Wanton Mee. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ .

This recipe is from Marionâ€™s Kitchen, and I highly recommend it. In fact, she has a few other renditions of easy noodle fry-ups, which Iâ€™ll be trying too! If youâ€™d like the recipe to this, just look for the same dish on her channel. .
