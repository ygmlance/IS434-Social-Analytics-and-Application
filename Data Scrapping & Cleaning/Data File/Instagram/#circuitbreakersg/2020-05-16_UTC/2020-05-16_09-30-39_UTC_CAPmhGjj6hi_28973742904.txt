Nothing says home like the smell of baking. Made weekdays a little sweeter for Mr K by baking these chocolate chip orange cookies for his weekday teatime.
.
Tip: Donâ€™t rush to bake the cookies immediately after mixing the dough. Leave it in the fridge for at least 2 hours before you start rolling them into balls. Chilling the dough helps to reduce excess moisture in the cookies which creates a caramelized flavour and achieves the desirable chewy centres and deliciously crispy edges.
