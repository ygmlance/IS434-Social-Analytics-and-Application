Tok Gong Summer IPA by Archipelago Brewery üá∏üá¨üç∫
‚Å£
This is an easy quaff for a 5-hop IPA. At 5.5% ABV, Tok Gong is a good introductory IPA for those who are new to craft. It's not a huge step up in terms of alcohol content from the usual lagers, but it definitely packs enough hop flavour to brighten even our perpetual summer days.

Cheers to @archipelagobrewerysg for another enjoyable brew! ‚Å£
