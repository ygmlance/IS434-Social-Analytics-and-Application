Not the prettiest photo but just want to post this to document my third chiffon cake! Made two today. So tiring. But loved seeing how they turned out. The first had some hiccups but glad it turned out fine. This is the 2nd one. 
If I compare with the previous time I made the pandan chiffon cake, previously I definitely underwhipped the meringue. Instead of overwhipping like I had mentioned.

But I'm facing a common issue where I am having some liquid egg whites at the bottom of the bowl despite whipping the whites to stiff peaks. Its so weird. Does it have to to do with the temperature of the eggs I wonder?

Nevertheless I hope this one will be well enjoyed by the recipients. 🙆🏻‍♀️😊 .
