And so we did it! The kids donned their masks and we took them out for a bit...well a much needed haircut actually. We found out that their favourite hair salon was closing after 31 years in business so we wanted to say goodbye and of course get their hair cut. What a difference a haircut makes. ✂️ .
After being home for 6 weeks, the kids were wiped out after our short outing but they were over the moon to be in sun, chasing birds and just feeling the rays on their faces. And it felt so good to just be out with the kids even though it was just for a short while. .
