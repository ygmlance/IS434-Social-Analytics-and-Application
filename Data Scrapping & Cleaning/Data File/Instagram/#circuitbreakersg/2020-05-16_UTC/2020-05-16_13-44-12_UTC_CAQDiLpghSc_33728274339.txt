A different kind of donation~
With many calls to #donatethe600, many of us might be thinking if there are other ways to help our community out during this time, and if there may be anything else we can donate. Well, since the circuit breaker, the number of blood donors have dropped tremendously! Blood supplies have been draining out, with several blood types going down to a critically low level. YOUR help is needed! Each donation can save up to THREE lives, and every donation counts. 
Visit redcross.sg for information on blood donations during this CB. Remember, YOU could save the next personâ€™s life.
