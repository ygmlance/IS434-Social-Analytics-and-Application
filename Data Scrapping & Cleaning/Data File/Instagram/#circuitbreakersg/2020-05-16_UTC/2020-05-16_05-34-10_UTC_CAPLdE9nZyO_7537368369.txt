Our Korean lunch spread for today from @junkoreansingapore! The food was quite delish, absolutely hit the spot - is been craving for army stew for a while, and I wish j had ordered another portion of it! Got the bbq pork belly for the kid who mostly inhaled it! @jacintha.ng you gotta order from here!
