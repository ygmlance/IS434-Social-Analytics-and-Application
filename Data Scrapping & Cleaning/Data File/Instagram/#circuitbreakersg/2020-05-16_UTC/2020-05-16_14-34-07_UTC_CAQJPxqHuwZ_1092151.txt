ü•≥ Fast food on Saturday night! Asked the hub if he would like to have Jollibee for dinner as I am craving for it. Without much saying, he asked me what I want while he's getting ready to go Jurong East to buy it. And guess what, he told me he bought a "surprise" for me when he's home. It's the mille crepes from Chateraise. So much love from this man. ‚ù§Ô∏è
