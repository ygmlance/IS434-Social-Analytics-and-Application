*Do you know about different fabric properties?*

Most of the things I make are cotton â€“ printed fabrics, unbleached lining, flannel, terry. I love linen too, especially as clothing in this humidity. Thank you @theverdantlab for the lovely blue and the wine florals ðŸ’›ðŸ’›ðŸ’›

But some things require specialty fabric with specific properties â€“ waterproof lining in my snack baggies and cutlery pouches, wet bags. For me, itâ€™s about understanding fabric properties well (which i've spent a lot of time doing), in order to choose the most appropriate fabric for product X.

One of the fabrics that often masquerades as cotton is polycotton - a blend of polyester and cotton. I purchased a couple of t-shirts about 4 months ago online and failed to read the fine print (I thought they were all 100% cotton but only the some colours were a 50% cotton-poly blend). I couldnâ€™t figure out why I loved wearing one but hated the other till I read the label and confirmed that the one I hated was a poly blend.

So waterproof fabrics retain heat and moisture and you canâ€™t breath through them but they are waterproof; performance fabrics wick moisture away from skin but only if the clothing is form fitting and sits directly on your skin; woven polycotton â€“ I donâ€™t see the point of that other than itâ€™s cheap (itâ€™s not even waterproof because water flows in between the woven fibres); natural fibres are breathable and the fibres themselves expand to absorb moisture but are not waterproof.

My reusable cloth masks are made from 100% cotton fabric because â€˜good quality quilting cottonâ€™ and t-shirts have been researched and recommended. What I also do is make sure the various cottons I use are of a sufficiently dense weave ; I donâ€™t use too-thin or loose-weave fabrics (e.g., linen tends to be of a looser weave which is great for clothing breathability but not for discouraging droplets). @nanalovesapples approved of my fabric ðŸ¤—

The next time you buy something check the label or ask. See if you can feel the difference.
