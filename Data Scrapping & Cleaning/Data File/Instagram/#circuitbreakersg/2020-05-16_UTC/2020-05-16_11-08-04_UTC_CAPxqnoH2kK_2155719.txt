Look here! Look here! 
It’s KL Hokkien Mee. 🇲🇾 Whenever I’m in KL, I would sure head down to PJ to eat my favourite black KL style Hokkien Mee. Trying very hard to replicate but I still couldn’t fry the wok hey that I wanted. But both my hub n gurl said it’s very nice and flavourful. The characters for Hokkien mee is cabbage, choy sum, squid, sliced pork. I omitted prawns because I can’t eat. The two star ingredients are deep fried pork lard and sole fish powder.
This noodle requires tai lok mee (a special thick noodle) but I couldn’t find it so I used flat yellow noodles instead. 
KL style Hokkien mee is drenched in special black soya sweet sauce fried with pork lard and I added dried shrimp too. 
I got to go before my family finished off the noodles.
