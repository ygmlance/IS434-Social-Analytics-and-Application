DAY 39, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
Chocolate Berry Cake
Dark chocolate cake with layers of fresh cream and starwberry preserve, with fresh berries on top.

Cant have one cake for two boys ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The second cake was this one. 
My little cuties have grown up to be responsible young men, but it gives me as much joy to cook for them now as it did when they were little.
No grand celebration this time, but I am glad we are together, and happy, and blessed with good food in abundance. Thankyou Dear Lord, for all the blessings in my life. Cant ask for more.
