Day 12 Hols = Day 40 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
5km run PLUS HR's No Repeat Workout
(featuring Power Squat Jack) 
#7dayhomeworkoutchallenge with #heatherrobertsoncom 
This morning's 5km run was much more enjoyable and I didn't look at my watch much. Was glad to complete it and noticed the grass grew very fast along the road.. It shows how much grass cutters have been working.. Don't know when was the last time they cut it.. I had to run on the grass as usual to avoid people.. Today's Heather Robertson's workout is opposite of yesterday and there were no repeats in her workout so it was 40 different exercises! I tried to film some of it, u can see my IG stories later.. Got to prep for my Zoom session on Hommeet!
