Inspired by a fb post, I decided to bake one of my favourite breads - The Brazilian cheese bread. Crumbly on the outside, chewy on the inside!
Just that I spoilt the bottoms today, probably need more oil to brush the muffin tray.

.
1 egg - room temperature
1/3 cup olive oil
2/3 cup milk - room temperature 
1 1/2 cup tapioca starch 
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese (Also can mix 1/4 cheddar and 1/4 mozzarella)
1 tsp salt

Method
1. Blend all ingredients together until smooth.
2. Transfer batter to muffin tin brushed with olive oil. Fill up to approximately 3/4 full.
3. Bake in oven 200 deg celsius for 20 mins.
