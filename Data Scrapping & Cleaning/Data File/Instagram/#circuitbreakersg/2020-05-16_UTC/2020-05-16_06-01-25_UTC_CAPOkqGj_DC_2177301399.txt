Just completed some online shopping. Meanwhile to replenish some stocks for the continual fight against COVID-19 and also support small businesses.

Online shopping has been a norm but is more apparent during Circuit Breaker. It will be tough for businesses who have difficulties transitioning to online platforms.

Wonder if there will be changes to our future lifestyle during post-covid. What do you think?
