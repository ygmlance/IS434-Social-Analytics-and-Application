Boogaloo is all about GROOVE and the SWAG and it’s something I’ll be teaching a little during our FREE class happening at THE STREET CHA CHA EXPERIENCE on Sunday.

The truth is you can ALSO dance Cha Cha to any pop song now, so this is like a double treat. Needless to say it’s very very easy to learn. 😄

Come join me for the BEGINNER INTRO class at 430pm and then we go listen in to one of my favorite DJ in the world at , DJ Haihan who will play you his favorite tunes at 530pm. We can dance together yea? 😍😍
