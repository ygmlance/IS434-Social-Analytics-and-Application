In the beginning of the 2nd week of #MOESingapore school holiday, our P1 son and I (hopefully, we could include his little sister in the decision making in the near future) had a dialog to decide on our #familyrules after I learned the importance of having them written from a book "Winning With Honour: In Relationships, Family, Organisations, Leadership, And Life‚Äù authored by Joanne Lim (The Right Perspective SG) & #LimSiongGuan, published by @worldscientificpub. A written visual to our family rules can be helpful for our little children to refer to in challenging time, especially when we have to spend 24/7 at home. The family rules have helped our son to be patient to his little sister after attempting hard to teach her read animal words through a "lost letters" activity courtesy of @publiclibrarysg this morning, he would try again. He also appreciates our teachers more than ever, it is not easy but honourable to teach. #ThankYouTeachers  #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe#StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
