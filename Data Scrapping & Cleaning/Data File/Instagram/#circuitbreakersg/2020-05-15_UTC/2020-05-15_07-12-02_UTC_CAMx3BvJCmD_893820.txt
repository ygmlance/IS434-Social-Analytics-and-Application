#steak for lunch again lol
In addition to carrots, red bell peppers and my favourite #brusselsprouts, I made yummy pumpkin garlic #mashedpotatoes
.
I used a 2:1 ratio of russet potatoes to Australian pumpkin, threw in a few cloves of garlic and simmered till tender. Mash everything up, then add pepper and a generous amount of french butter. ðŸ˜‹
