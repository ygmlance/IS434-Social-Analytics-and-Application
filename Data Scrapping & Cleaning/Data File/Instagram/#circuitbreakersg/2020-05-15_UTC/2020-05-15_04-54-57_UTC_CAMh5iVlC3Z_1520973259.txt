Trust me, pairing Indian and Mexican flavours can never go wrong; especially in these super easy Prata Quesadillas, made with minimum ingredients! A special version made using fresh, chopped ingredients and some protein to go with it, this is Chef Milind's 'Bombay Sandwich' rendition of a Mexican Quesadilla!

Perfect for circuit breaker and lockdown cooking, in this tasty recipe, we're featuring none other than, our beloved frozen Roti Prata's, but with a Chef Milind twist.

Recipe:

Grill two frozen Roti Pratas on a non-stick pan and make sure they're crispy and golden-brown on both sides.

Take one Prata and spread some Mayonnaise on it.

Top it with one sliced onion.

Arrange 8-10 slices of cucumber.

Top with a few slices of fresh tomato.

SprinkleÂ some salt and pepper.

Sprinkle some cheddar cheese.

Add a few slices of boiled potato.

Add boiled egg slices/ sausages/ boiled chicken.

Cover it with the second prata and cut it into four triangular slices!
