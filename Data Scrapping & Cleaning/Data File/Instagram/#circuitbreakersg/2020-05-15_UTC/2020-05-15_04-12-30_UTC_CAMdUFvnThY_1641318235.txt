Orders typically take 3-5 days to be processed, but due to their limited operations in line with the #circuitbreaker measures, please expect slight delay in delivery for orders placed during this period. Also, even though they offer FREE local shipping for all orders, consider topping up for courier to prevent loss or delayed mails.
