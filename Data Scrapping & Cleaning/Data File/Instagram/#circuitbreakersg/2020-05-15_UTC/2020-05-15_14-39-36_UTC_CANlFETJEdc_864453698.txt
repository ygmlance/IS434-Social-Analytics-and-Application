7 TEA Café 台灣茶飲小舖 is a small bubble tea stall located on the third floor of Taman Jurong Food Centre.

Their bubble teas are really affordable, starting from just $1.50 for the basic milk tea.

This is probably the cheapest in Singapore!

I ordered the large Bubble Milk Tea ($2.50), with 30% sugar level and less ice.

To my surprise, for its price it was actually quite good.

The milk tea was smooth and creamy, and the pearls were sweet and chewy.

It did not taste bland and thin like some other low quality BBTs.

I’ll be going back again to check out their other popular drinks.
