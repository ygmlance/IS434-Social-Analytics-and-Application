15/31 - I Am The Dream
Prompt: What's the funniest thing thay happened to me last year?
Reaction:  Something that i find happening on a more recent scale is in the disability to differentiate my dreams from reality. Sometimes it feels so long or so "real" that i have troubles trying to differentiate dream from reality. In which spurring changes that makes no complete sense.
.
For #circuitbreakermay, i've decided to take on an experiment in abstract imagery using the prompts from #theisolationjournals , to inspire me from their writing. During the #ecbm (extended circuit breaker measures) that will be in place in #singapore for the month of may.
