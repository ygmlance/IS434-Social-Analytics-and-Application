The #circuitbreakersg period has seen the creative and innovative sides of many parents. Parents have doubled (tripled or even more) up as teachers, full-time 24/7 caretakers while working. .
As a #workingmum, I am faced with the pressure to meet deadlines at work daily while catering to the needs of my infant and preschooler. Truth be told, I am guilty of not being able to fully cater to Tyra daily and I feel bad whenever she asks “What can I do today, Mummy?” and my reply to her is “You have many toys, my dear, please play with them or I’ll have to donate them to kids who need them more than you.” .
Few weeks back, my fellow working mum gf @reizz embarked on her urban farming activity from @superfarmers with her young kids. I thought to myself that this urban farming at home might just be a great idea to keep Tyra busy and to instill accountability in her. So thank you @reizz  for the 💡😘. Swipe left to see videos of Tyra trying her hand at #urbanfarming. We have planted three types of vegetables 🥬 , Chye Sim, Kang Kong and Chinese Kale and are waiting patiently for the day when Tyra can consume them.😅 I wonder what she will say at that time.

For a week now, Tyra has been running to her lil garden every morning to check on her plants and to water them religiously. It first started off with “I still do not see anything, Mummy!” up till Monday when she exclaimed, Mummy, MY plants have grown!!! I can see them now!” That gleam of joy and excitement in her eyes watching her plants grow are simply gratifying. So parents, you may consider to get your kids to try their hands at urban farming during this period! .
