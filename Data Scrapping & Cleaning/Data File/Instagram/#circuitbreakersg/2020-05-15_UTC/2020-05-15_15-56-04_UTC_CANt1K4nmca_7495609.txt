I learnt a new term from @three_teos & @moosemousse1984 - CABIN FEVER
.
noun
1.
lassitude, irritability, and similar symptoms resulting from long confinement or isolation indoors during the winter
.
I had texted both of them because my friend here has 2 boys & solo parenting too & the other is our kid’s dad 😅 who is now stuck in China. #charmerteo has started to lost interest in everything & anything since days ago, but yesterday was extremely disturbing. He tried to play along the activities at home but most of the time he just dazed out. If not, he was out irritating everyone, making his siblings cry or hurt, making me irritated with his actions & words. We had a long talk at night after didi & Mei Mei slept... He said he was “bored” “he just want to get out” he “doesn’t know what he want” “nothing makes him happy even ipad”... So, @moosemousse1984 tot he need some BIG BOY ACTIVITIES while Daddy said he need to get some fresh outdoor air... So I tried to entice him with food. People often said Happy Belly Happy Mind. We tried to make his favourite pizza 🍕 together & have fun making their own juices 🥤. Then we ended our day scooting & when I asked him how he was feeling tonight. He said “better”... well, we will try again tomorrow.

This #circuitbreakersg is really an unhealthy period physically & mentally. I didn’t expect my child to have #cabinfever just “out of a sudden”, I tot he was coping it alright but I was wrong... what do I expect from a child when we adults are not taking this whole CB well... 😔
