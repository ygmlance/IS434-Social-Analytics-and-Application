This is my own version of Nasi Lemak.
There are drumsticks 🍗 , otah, chili petai & fishballs, stir fry veggies, chicken franks and fried shredded egg.  Achar I bought from the market. ////
The rice turns out so legit with the coconut milk and pandan flavour and the drumsticks which I marinated the day before, I just pop them into the air fryer and it turns out so flavourful! 😋 ///
Is not authentic Nasi Lemak but it is good enough for us.  Lim Bae say is nice! 👍🏻 🥰
