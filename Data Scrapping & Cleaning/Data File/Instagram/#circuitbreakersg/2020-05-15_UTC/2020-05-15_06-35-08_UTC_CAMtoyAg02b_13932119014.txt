“Make every journey fun. Do every work with 100% effort” - this was the quote I came across during my first week of school. 
Since the start of HBL 5 weeks ago, this has been crazily hectic. So much so that I never really got the time to sit down and reflect on it. Well, now that HBL has ended and we are now going into our Mid-term break, I just can’t stop thinking about what a ride this has been. 
HBL started out with uncertainty, a bunch of excitement, coupled with anxiousness, sprinkled with a handful of self-doubt. It was, honestly, really tough. 
But with the great support and leadership from the school’s management team, along with amazing teamwork from the team, and wonderful colleagues/friends to keep me sane, we made it!! We completed 5 weeks of HBL with fun and 100% effort! 
As we take our well-deserved break before we continue with yet another new normal when we return to school, I thank God for the nice people I’ve met along the way; especially for the patience, support given and the faith they have in me. I truly can’t wait to continue on this exciting adventure that is coming up because I know that I am not going to be alone in this!
