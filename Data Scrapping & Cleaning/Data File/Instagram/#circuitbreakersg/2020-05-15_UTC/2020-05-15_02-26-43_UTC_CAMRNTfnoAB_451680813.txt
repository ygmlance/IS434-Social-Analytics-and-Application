Rainy days are here once again — it’s a blessing to be sheltered from the storm by keeping safe indoors, don’t you think? #StayHomePerks

We're now at the end of Week 6 of our #CircuitBreaker #PastHalfwayMark
Initially, we all felt that it would be such a long time before we would see the end of it. But as the saying goes, good things come to those who wait, and while we cannot guarantee the proverbial pot of gold, there will surely be the rainbow after this shower. All we need to do is to keep our heads up so that we don’t miss it (even if that means taking our eyes off our books for a while, it’s worth it).

#SomeThingsWeMiss: Peering out of our shop window to see the world go by, sharing our books and time with you. But it won’t be long before we meet again, so let’s sit tight and strong for the rest of this ride.
