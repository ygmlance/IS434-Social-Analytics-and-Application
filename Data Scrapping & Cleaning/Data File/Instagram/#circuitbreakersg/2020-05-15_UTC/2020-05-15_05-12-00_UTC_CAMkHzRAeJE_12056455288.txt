Here is a photo of me in 2017 👀⁣
It also marked a turning point in my life. It was my awakening. ⁣
⁣
Beyond this cheerful smile, I was quite down on the inside. I put on a facade of happiness when I step onto planes, and when I'm on my way to meet my clients at the other side of this world, but found myself feeling a CRUSHING amount of stress every time I'm left alone to myself. ⁣
⁣
This was the period of time where I allowed others to dictate what I should have done with my money: buying them trips 🛫, expensive dinners 🛍️, lavish gifts 🎁 and lifestyles because I constantly allowed myself to feel guilt-tripped like I OWE them something 🤦‍♀️⁣
⁣
I had zero financial direction even though I was pulling in SIX figures in my software business. ⁣
So, naturally I felt like QUEEN of the world. 👸 ⁣
⁣
👑 But would a queen sink into negativity in quiet moments? ⁣
👑 Would a queen feel so lost and directionless when it comes to the outflow of her resources, her MONEY? ⁣
👑 Would a Queen allow someone else to dictate what they could do with her resources, her MONEY?⁣
⁣
❌ Heck, NO. ❌⁣
⁣
On my flight back from Los Angeles to Singapore, I vividly recall stepping out of my cushy, business class seat with a sudden, strong gush of motivation. I knew I couldn't allow myself to pretend I've got everything handled when in fact I didn't. I knew I had to do something, and FAST. 🔥⁣
⁣
Fast forward to 2020, not only have I gained COMPLETE control over my personal finance and direction, I've also started helping women who found themselves in similar positions, unable to break free:⁣
⁣
💠 Women who know they need to be able to handle their money splurges better⁣
💠 Women who are aware of their money mistakes, women who are actively looking for financial resources but are constantly overwhelmed by the saturation of content. ⁣
💠 These are women who desire to feel more CONTROLLED, ORGANISED, and CLEAR about her money, who want to feel CALM, COLLECTED, and CONFIDENT.⁣
⁣
💌 If this is you, I need to speak with you, URGENTLY.⁣
Send me a DM. (convos are kept safe & confidential ✨)
