🌟GIVEAWAY ENDED🌟 [BEAUTY]

Almost everyday around late afternoon, I’ll find my face becoming extremely oily (yes, even if I were to just sit around and not do any vigorous activity). These days, I have accepted reality and will just take 1 or 2 pieces of tissue to wipe off those oil.

But, a week ago, @ploermel_lab sent me their Ploermel’s Discovery Kit, which includes a Detoxifying Whitening Serum, an Intensive Firming & Moisturizing Serum and 4 x Aqua Plus Masks.

After a 7-day beauty regime using solely those products + my own cleanser, I noticed that my face has become less oily but yet still moisturized. I literally do not need the additional step of using a tissue to wipe off the oil on my face that will accumulate throughout the day.

The goodness of Ploermel’s products lies in their key ingredients, which are ancient and premium. Also, the formula is researched & developed by their dermatologist in Taiwan, who has spent years in a cosmeceutical company in France. Want to try it for yourself?
