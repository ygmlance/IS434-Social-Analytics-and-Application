Lovely USDA Prime Striploin from @hubersbutchery ! The beef by itself was so tender, sweet and robust in flavours! 🤩

I did a 54℃ water bath for 24 hours and dust it with salt and pepper before scorching the surfaces of the thick steak on a hot skillet with butter for just seconds. I simply had it with some truffle mustard and sticky balsamic, and it was really good! 😋

There was a layer of fats which I trimmed off, diced it and did a Fried Rice with some leftover Buak Keluak sauce. Shiok! 👍🏻👍🏻
