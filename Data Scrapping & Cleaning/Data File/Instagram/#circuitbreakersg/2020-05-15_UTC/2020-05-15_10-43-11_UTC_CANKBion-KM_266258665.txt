QuaranQueen looks 👸🏽〰️ 〰️ 〰️ Category is: Plant Mom Realness 🌵 (last pic is the face I make evrytime I think about my plant babies)🤪 ok ok this was a look I did yesterday so I could look decent for the viewers when I went LIVE on IG to chat with Coconuts for their series Coco Chats (check out the latest episode I posted on my IGTV series ‘Living Consciously’ for snippets from that!) Almost forgot how to look cute after not dressing up for like 5 weeks now? Most of the time these days I’m channeling rabid abandoned cat vibes 😭😹
