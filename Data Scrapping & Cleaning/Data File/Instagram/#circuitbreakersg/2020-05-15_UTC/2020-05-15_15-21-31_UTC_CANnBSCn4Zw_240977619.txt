Short 30min full body workout today with the brother @derrickguo 
No equipments, just our bodies and the mats.
.
EMOTM 7mins (Shuffle through the different exercises)
- 5/5/5 Wide, standard, diamond push ups
- 5/5/5 V-ups, side, side
- 10x Single leg lunge
- 10x Burpees
.
I actually started with piston squats but on the second set, my left knee started to feel weird. So I ended up changing it to the single leg lunge. Safety first!
