Trigger that curiosity and desire to learn in your 6-year-old. Introduce your kiddos to new words and engage them in conversation often! A rich vocab helps your child understand what other people are saying and what they are reading. Don't think "They're only 6! How can they understand?". Instead, think "They're only 6! They can learn so much!" #CarouselleLearning
