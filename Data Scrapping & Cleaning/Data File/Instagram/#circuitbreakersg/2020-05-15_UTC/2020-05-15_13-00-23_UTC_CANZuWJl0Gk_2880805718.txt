Crow Pose Tutorial 👇🏼
⁣
Received a request for a crow pose tutorial. Disclaimer: I'm not a yogi so I found out how this pose is taught in yoga classes from my wife. I also show my way of getting into the pose.

𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗲𝘀. If you can do what I do in the first video - squat on your front foot with your hands on the ground and stand up halfway from that position, you're good mobility-wise. Strength-wise, you should be comfortable with at least the wrist-loading on normal push-ups.

The second video demonstrates how yoga classes teach you to get into the crow pose. The last video demonstrates how I got myself into the crow pose when I tried replicating the position years ago after seeing it in photos.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: I lean forward and shift my weight onto my hands at about the same time as I am positioning my knees on my upper arms, while my wife tells me that she was taught to position her knees on her upper arms first before leaning forward for the weight shift onto the hands.

Which way is better? I'd say there is more than one way to skin a cat, so do whichever you feel more comfortable with. The crow pose is a good introductory handbalancing position, and you can press up from it into a handstand, or pursue the one-armed version.

Stay safe, and have fun training!
