ICHIKOKUDO

Teriyaki Unagi Don ($17.20+)
Grilled eel coated with teriyaki sauce, set above a bed of Japanese rice with shredded seaweed and pickles. The generous serving of unagi was soft and tender.ðŸ¤¤
. 
Hokkai Seafood BBQ ($11.20+)
Prawns, scallops and clams tossed with capsicum and sauce. It was unfortunate that the scallops were not on the shell. Two types of prawns were served, shelled and deshelled. Taste wise Iâ€™d say pretty good. The deshelled prawns had a crunchier texture than the shelled ones, which werenâ€™t exactly fresh.ðŸ¥º
.
ICHIKOKUDOâ€™s grilled gyoza ($7.20+)
This was the highlight of the meal. ðŸ¤©Each piece was grilled to perfection with its crispy base and ever succulent filling.

Japanese Beef Yakiniku Don ($14.20+)
.
Beef Chashu Don ($15.20+)

They are having 50% off donburi and sides now, so itâ€™s definitely value for money (prices stated are before discount)! Personally I would totally recommend trying the gyoza, but the rice bowls were pretty average, after all the shop is better known for its ramen.
