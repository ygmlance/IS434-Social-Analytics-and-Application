ðŸŒºI cannot keep to one technique only
Besides botanical art, I do steam punk and ethnic illustrations. A Iâ€™ve recently discovered the joy of abstract art.
ðŸ¦‹So far Iâ€™ve painted three pieces - one of those was a commission for a bar, but we gotta wait till the end of circuit breaker to frame it #circuitbreakersg 
Abstract art is full of freedom Iâ€™ve never imagined before! That is not easy to loose your strokes and do what you very well please! There is a big barrier to transit from botanical art to something that leaves people puzzled - what the heck is painted here?
ðŸ˜ŸDo you like abstract art ?!
