Breakfast today, was my last two pieces of Orh Kueh, or Steamed Yam Dumpling from @kuehs_and_snacks . These were panfried in lard, with a few dashes of fish sauce, a splash of chilli sauce, a swirl of sweet dark soya sauce, and topped with some chopped spring onions. A tasty and delightfully textural treat! ðŸ˜‹ #orhkueh #teochewfood #teochewcuisine #eatathome #kuehsandsnacks #supportlocalsg #savefnbsg #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
