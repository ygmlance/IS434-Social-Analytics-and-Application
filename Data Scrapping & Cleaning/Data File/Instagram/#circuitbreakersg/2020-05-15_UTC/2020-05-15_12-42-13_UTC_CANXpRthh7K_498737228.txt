13.05.2020 | Baklava but not Baklava
Howâ€™s everyone so far? During the #circuitbreakersg , a lot of food images kept popping up on my feed and insta-stories. So why not try some of them kan?
Ok, this one is Baklava. Apparently, itâ€™s a turkish dessert and #nurwantstobemysterious ordered them (which i shall not say from where). They are bite size but i feel that the crust? didnt match well with the feeling. After close inspection, i think the base is made of those popiah skin? I mean i think lah because it gave that crunch but i believe so.
Anyways, #nurwantstobemysterious says that she wont order again but her expectations were too high because she saw other influencers/celebrities raving about it but i donâ€™t get the hype. 
Letâ€™s see what should we get next week!ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤—
