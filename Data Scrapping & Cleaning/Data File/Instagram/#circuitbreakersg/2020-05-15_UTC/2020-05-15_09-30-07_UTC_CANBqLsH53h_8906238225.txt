DiGize is one of the first oils that my husband fell in love with (the first was Frankincense). When he went through my oil stash, he was drawn to the spicy aroma of it. We soon realised that this was the missing piece in our life (and tummies). I'm lactose-intolerant, I'm supposed to be on a gluten-free diet and fail miserably so I will always get tummy issues. My husband has a sensitive tummy too (although he denies it all the time but I will always find him looking for DiGize) ðŸ˜‚â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
So DiGize was amazing because it's a great alternative for digestive support. This essential oil blend includes Taragon, Ginger, Peppermint, Juniper, Fennel, Lemongrass, Anise, and Patchouli. Many of these ingredients aid in relieving indigestion and all sorts of other bathroom-related troubles (from both ends). â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
To use topically, place a couple drops in your palm, add in a splash of carrier oil, and rub directly on your lower abdomen or just put on a roller top like mine and just roll on navel, diaphragm to ease your discomfort â™¡â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
ðŸ•’You can roll it clockwise if you're constipated or counter clockwise for pain/discomfort ðŸ•’â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
