Started off @jae.explorer with topic study about a couple of months back and he's having fun so far! When jae was really little, it was mostly mummy-directed learning. Now, the learning is more child-directed! Since it's the holidays and we can't travel this season, we decided to go around the world with limited resources ~ ITALY is our 1st destination (chosen by jae)

Thankful for free printables that enhanced our learning experiences. 👏👏I also showed jae his photos from our Italy trip when he was really small. 😍😍 In this topic study, we learnt about: ✔ Flag of Italy (meaning of each of its colours)
✔ Different cities in Italy
✔ Talked about the attraction that @jae.explorer would like to visit someday
✔ famous icons of Italy
✔ Italian food

And of course, the highlight of the topic study was....WE HAD PIZZA !😋😋😋 Where will we be off to next?🤔🤔
