Its day 37 i think of our #circuitbreakersg and for #dinner tonite, i made some #glassnoodles (or #tanghoon ) #meatballs , store bought #fishballs and woodear #mushrooms ( chinese #blackfungus mushroom) and instead of making my own broth, i bought a pkt of #korean soy bean paste and used dat instead as my soup base

Besides dat, I also whipped up  some fresh #prawns (deveined and cleaned properly, of crse) sauteed with chopped onions and binded together with tomato #garlic sauce 😁😋👍 The prawns were really juicy  and succulent and the sauce omg, so #aromatic and it went well with rice, total #yums 👌🤭 .
