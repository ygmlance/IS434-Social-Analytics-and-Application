Filipino brunch today! I cooked the Filipino Trinity of Breakfast Plates - known as Tapsilog - this garlicky and super umami Beef Tapa, Fried Egg, and Sinangag (Garlic Fried Rice) made of Cauliflower Rice. 💪🏻 I had strips of beef in the fridge and didn’t know what to cook with it. I was targeted by a Tapa King SG ad on FB, and I had the brilliant idea of marinating overnight the beef strips I had in light soy sauce, fish sauce, minced garlic, and squeezed lemon. And voila - I have homemade beef tapa without all those unnecessary preservatives!!! The cauliflower rice did sinangag some justice as well - healthy pa!!! I truly enjoyed my Friday brunch!!! #tapsilog #beeftapa #tapa #breakfast #brunch #filipinofood #filipinocuisine #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
