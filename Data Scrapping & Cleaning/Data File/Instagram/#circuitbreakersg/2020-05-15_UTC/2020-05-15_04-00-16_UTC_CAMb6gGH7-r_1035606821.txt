With the AWARE Helpline ringing off the hook, our dedicated team of staff and volunteers are hard at work answering calls. While they usually do so from the AWARE office, the team is now Helplining from home. 
Says this Helpliner: "COVID stealthily took over my life and I had to adapt to the new norm of working from home. Being an online Helpliner is both trying and rewarding, as I've grappled with technological glitches - but I want to be a listening ear to those in distress and unable to step out due to the circuit breaker." Our surge in calls does not seem likely to abate anytime soon. To help us support as many callers as possible, consider donating to our Vulnerable Women's Fund. Link in bio.
