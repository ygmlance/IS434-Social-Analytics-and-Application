I started my professional career 10 years ago in the social sector. Went overseas to volunteer and landed a job in the private sector before returning to SG's public healthcare. And 5.5 years later, my boss puts me in charge of a programme  that marries public health and social services. She even offered to nominate me for become a social service fellow. #onefullcircle

To be honest, it was truly tempting to accept her offer. The prestige that it brings will probably put me in a good position for the programme im in. And the extra money doesn't hurt. But it comes at a cost - I will need to commit at least 80 hours/yr outside of my paid employment for the next 3 years.

Next year I will be able to own my flat and with that I will proceed with applying to become a foster mother. So I don't even know if I will be able to continue working full time and I do not want to tie myself down in any way that will make it difficult for me to foster or distract me from my calling.

Thank God for His peace in this decision and I am sure that if that fellowship is what He wants for me, there will be another opportunity.
