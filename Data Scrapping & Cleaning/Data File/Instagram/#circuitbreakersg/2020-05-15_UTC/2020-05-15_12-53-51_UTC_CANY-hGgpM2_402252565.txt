TGIF ✨ What a crazy week we had with a huge shipment dropped at our door on Monday. 90% of it didn’t make it into our warehouse but went straight out to many of you Pickers who placed pre-orders and waited patiently ❤️ thank you all so so much for your awesome love & support 💕 we are beyond grateful 😘 .
.
There are many of you asking about next shipment to restock those super popular picks. Yes we are working on that. Do follow our IG stories the next 1 day or so while we sort out our next shipments, especially in bringing those sold out picks back 👌🏻 .
Happy weekend ahead 💕
