Taking a little break from Numbers theme and sharing some more animal-themed 成语故事 idiom stories! This time from a different set.⠀
⠀
P.S. Both idiom stories sets are restocked!⠀
⠀
This selection of 30 《逗逗镇 成语故事》Dou Dou Town Idiom Stories is so hilarious - keeps my 5yo and 7yo in giggles during our daily silent reading time in the afternoons.⠀
⠀
Set in a style that reminds us of Mr. Men and little Miss books. Comes with Hanyu Pinyin, has Idiom learning cards!! Step by step drawing instructions, and many more features.⠀
⠀
I’d say this is suitable from ages 4-12, and beyond! This is perfect for primary school students’ silent reading sessions too!⠀
⠀
I do enjoy reading this on my own a lot too - there’s so much to learn #活到老学到老 🤓⠀
