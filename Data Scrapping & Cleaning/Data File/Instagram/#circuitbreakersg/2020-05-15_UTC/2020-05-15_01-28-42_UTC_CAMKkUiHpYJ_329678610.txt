The range of TOPP Thai Jasmine Rice Congee stir up a warm, tasty & satisfying light meal by simply adding boiling water and letting it simmer for 5 minutes

Comes in 3 delicious flavours; Chicken Mushroom, Seafood and Vegetable

Smells heavenly and very tasty. I even added my own pork floss and seaweed to add to the shiokness
