🕢Dinner: 
Pad Kra Pao & Tom Yum Soup

Sawadee krap🙏🏻 Let’s go Thailand,the land of smile today 🇹🇭
When the husband craving for Thai food,I shall work with My Magic.💫
Pad Kra Pao,aka stir-fry basil minced pork and it’s filled with minced pork,garlic,chillies,fish sauce and a handful of Thai basil.

You can always replace with beef or chicken instead of pork, they taste just as good !

This dish seems simple and quick but packed with flavour ! it’s spicy and salty, and goes perfectly with a bowl of steam rice!

Complete the meal with a bowl of hot tom yum soup, with prawns and shimeiji mushrooms.

Cravings satisfied with a happy tummy.
