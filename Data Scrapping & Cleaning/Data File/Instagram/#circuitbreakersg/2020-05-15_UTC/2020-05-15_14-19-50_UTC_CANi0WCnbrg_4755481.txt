On fire! For dessert it was #crepesuzette because again had dying #oranges 
I decided to make the crepes with my #blinipan because I never use that enough and I thought it would be easier to swish the small crepes in the sauce rather than the large fiddly ones. However I can’t really get the small crepes to spread as thinly using this pan so won’t be doing this again. 
Finished off with a #flambé off #grandmarnier 
#lockdownlife #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
