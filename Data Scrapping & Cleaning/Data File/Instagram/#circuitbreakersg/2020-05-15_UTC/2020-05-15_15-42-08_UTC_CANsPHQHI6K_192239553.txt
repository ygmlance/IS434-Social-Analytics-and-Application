Working hard hand in hand
.
Friday night convo
.
A: Mum, why are you working so late and can you take leave to spend time with us?
.
B: Yay, we are gonna be wealthy kids
.
If boom holds such ideas about work, he’s going be sorely disappointed when he grows up. Working hard stems from being accountable and responsible
.
My mind brought me back to the past when dad used to work hard and if my memory didn’t fail me, I wished he could spend more time with us
.
The time of such longing didn’t last long as we quickly grew up and other things filled the void
.
With that, we goofed around till late
