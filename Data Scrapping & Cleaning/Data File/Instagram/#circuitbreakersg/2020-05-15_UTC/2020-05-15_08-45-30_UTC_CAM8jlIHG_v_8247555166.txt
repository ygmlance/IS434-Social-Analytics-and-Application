My almost weekly affair with 🍞 from @petitpain.sg! 😂
✨
Had the orange and chocolate escargot (S$3.80) and shiitake flatbread (S$4.50) this time and of cos the former is 💯 as usual. There‘s like more candied orange bits this batch which are 😍. I’m not a fan of fruits that are too sour in general but their candied orange bits are not too sour at all. Plus, orange and chocolate always go well together! 🍊🍫

As for the shiitake flatbread, I like that it isn’t too cheesy nor creamy, and the shallots which give so much depth to the overall taste profile. I also adore the crisp edges and fluffy interior with a slight chew. It’s like eating pizza! 🍕

When someone super fussy like me keeps going back to the same place, you know it’s really that good. Plus, their prices are very reasonable IMO. The sizes of their bakes are not at all small, but they’re not hard to finish as the texture is really light! ☁️
