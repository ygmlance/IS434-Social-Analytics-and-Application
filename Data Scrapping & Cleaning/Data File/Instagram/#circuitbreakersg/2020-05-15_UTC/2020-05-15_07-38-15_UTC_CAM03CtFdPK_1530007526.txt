🍗𝙵𝚛𝚒𝚎𝚍 𝙲𝚑𝚒𝚌𝚔𝚎𝚗 𝙵𝚛𝚒𝚍𝚊𝚢!

Having cravings for KFC on Day 39 CB but thought it was pretty ridiculous to pay almost 15 bucks for a 2 piece meal including delivery hence I decided to dabao again from the neighbourhood coffeeshop. I've always liked this Western stall located opp the market next to the UOB atm for their chicken chop and they have decent sides for mashed potato and coleslaw as well.

If you are old enough to remember, KFC used to serve fried chicken on porcelain plates. And that's what I'm doing here to relive my younger days. 😂
