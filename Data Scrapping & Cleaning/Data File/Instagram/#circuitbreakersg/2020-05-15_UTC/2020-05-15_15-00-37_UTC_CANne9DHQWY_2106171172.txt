Wifey made Budae Jjigae (Army Stew) tonight - our homemade version ðŸ˜‹ Along with fried zucchini-ricotta pan cake and a couple of banchan. Not the usual Army Stew on a fire stove... she improvised to served in a Le Creuset. Likewise for the zucchini pancake - she added ricotta cheese into the batter. Unconventional wasnâ€™t it? Thatâ€™s home creativity! Do with what you have! #circuitbreakersg #covid19 #stayhomestaysafe #armystew #armystewsg #budaejjigae #homemade #homemadebudaejjigae #friedzucchiniricottapancake #ramyeon #koreanramyeon #stayhomewithascott #lecreuset
