Has anyone eaten these? Every night, hundreds of people go online hoping to bid for these limited supply of “名牌包包”. These pao come in a packet of 10 for $8 and they are stuffed with bak kwa fillings. If you like bak kwa or char siew pao, you will definitely like this. I tried these “名牌包包” for the first time this morning and I begin to understand why they are so popular. I’m a fan now😊
