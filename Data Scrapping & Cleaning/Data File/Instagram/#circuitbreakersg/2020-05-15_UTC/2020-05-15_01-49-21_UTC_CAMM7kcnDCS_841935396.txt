CB Learning Point 🧐

Drive through McDonald’s and came out with my breakfast within 10 minutes😎. No long queue, no scuffles, no sweat. McDonald’s is here to stay la. Don’t need to rush. To bubble tea fans out there, please don’t rush when they reopen. It doesn’t kill you to get it sometime later, but it might kill you if you keep drinking 🤭.. #punintended “Sometimes you don’t have to be the first. Coming in second or third in line may be sweet too.” #JYthoughts #mcdonaldsbreakfast #circuitbreakersg
