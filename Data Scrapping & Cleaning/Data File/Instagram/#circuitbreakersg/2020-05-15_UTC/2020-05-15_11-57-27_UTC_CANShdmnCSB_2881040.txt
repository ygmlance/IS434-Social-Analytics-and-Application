Saw this recipe for Circuit Breaker Burger on tv a few days back & it looks too delicious not to try it! 😋😋 I made some slight changes to the ingredients as they were not available, so here's my version of the CB burger ~ 
Teriyaki pork belly sandwiched in grilled homemade sourdough bread, with garlic aioli, lettuce and tomato. Served with pan-fried rosemary potatoes 😍😍 Everyone at home loves this dish...definitely a keeper!👏👏 #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #sgparent #homecooking #sghomecooks #sginstagfood #sgbakes #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday39 #StayHomeCookOff #宅星刀叉战 #bryanwong
