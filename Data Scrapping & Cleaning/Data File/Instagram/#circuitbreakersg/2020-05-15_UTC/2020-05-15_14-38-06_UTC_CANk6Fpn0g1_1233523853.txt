For our upcoming #AtHomeWithRobb series presented by @straitswinecompany, we'll have guest chef Fernando Ar√©valo (@cheffernandoarevalo) of @preludio.sg taking the hot seat. He'll be making slow-roasted beef short rib, focussing on the best marinating and roasting techniques that readers can replicate at home.
