“Your battery is basically dead.”⁣

“How long does it take to change the battery?”⁣
⁣
“5-7 working days.”⁣
⁣
“So long just to change a battery?”⁣
⁣
“Ya. A lot of MacBooks on queue to repair.”⁣
⁣
Pfft. 🥴⁣
⁣
While current meeting/training schedule doesn’t allow letting the MacBook go for one freaking week, gotta be thankful that repair shops are still open now.⁣
⁣
Also thankful that the battery decided to die 2+ weeks before the 3-year AppleCare expires. #hengah #AnyLaterRepairNotFreeLiao #DontExplodeCanAlready ⁣
