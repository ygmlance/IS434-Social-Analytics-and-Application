The cake was good for about 4 to 6 people to share. The durian taste wasn't overpowering and there wasn't any durian bits, so it was sort of disappointing for me. Personally, I wished the durian taste was more as the cake was more creamy tasting instead. But my mum liked it so I guess its up to individual preference.
