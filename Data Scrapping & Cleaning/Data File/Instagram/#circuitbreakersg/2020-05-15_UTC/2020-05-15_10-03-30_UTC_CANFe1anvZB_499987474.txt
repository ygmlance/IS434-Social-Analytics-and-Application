[PART 2/7: ORANGE] Challenge: “One outfit in each colour of the rainbow?” from @kish_kebab, thank you! 💝

I love this co-ord set! It fit me perfectly off the rack and it’s linen, which is great for someone who’s as prone to overheating as me. The crop top fits so well because there’s a zip at the side, which makes it really easy to get in and out of. The two pieces work well separately too!
