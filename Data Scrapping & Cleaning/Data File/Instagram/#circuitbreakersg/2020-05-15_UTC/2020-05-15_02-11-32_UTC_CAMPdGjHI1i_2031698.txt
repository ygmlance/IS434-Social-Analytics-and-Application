Day 39 circuit breaker/ Day 10 Home Quarantine Order thoughts:

Happy feet cause swab test result is NEGATIVE!!!
NOT going to let go of this negative result which brings me positive outcome- the feeling of relieved.

I was worried I might be infected as I'm a suspected contact of the virus. Without getting tested, It left me hanging and was the worst feeling ever... I've prepared myself to continuously cave in and keep myself away from other human so I will not spread bad love... Sometimes, interaction with others isn't crucial to me but loosing the freedom to go out and go anywhere I desire, to enjoy doing things I love and I don't get to, like al fresco yoga at my favourite spot- by the Riverside... 💔... I believe you can relate too...Just because I carry it all so well does not mean it is not heavy and it hits me 😭 I cried out loud when I thought of it during my " Experience of wfh" presentation yesterday to my fellow colleagues via video call. Being vulnerable in front of people who are close to my heart and trusted, I am simply being a human. I'm glad I let it out lol

Everything happened for a reason, everything is connected.

Thank you Ministry of Health Sg for the swab test arrangement, thank you @hpbsg for the constant video calls to check on me( arhhhhh care, love & blessings from someone you don't know 😇♥️ 🤭) and thank you beautiful soul for sending me your beautiful blessings. Please expect a big hug from me when I see you again~ 😏😂✨ I still need to serve HQO though till 21st May, but knowing I'm not restricted to go out after it is completed, I am grateful ✨✨✨
