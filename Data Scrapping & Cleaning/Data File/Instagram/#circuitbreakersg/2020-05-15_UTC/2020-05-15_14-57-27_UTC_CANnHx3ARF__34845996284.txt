♣︎ Quick lunch ♣︎ Bitter Gourd Soup
📝Bitter gourd may not be well accepted but I find it tasty pairing with tomato and somehow the sweet, bitter and sour come together very well
📝With bee hoon, that will be a quick lunch option. I like 新竹 beehoon like the one I shared in mee siam post so will always be my first choice
📝You may use the tomato paste from steam tomato in tomato steam fish post. But boil from raw is also fine
📝I use light shiitake dashi pack from #souperdashi @souperstarsg as soup base. I do not add shiitake mushroom separately but I took out the shiitake from the dashi pack after boiling. #nowasteoffood

Ingredient: half bitter gourd, 2 tomatoes, half pack of 新竹 beehoon, minced pork (200g)

❶ Marinate minced pork with a bit of corn flour, white pepper and 2 tablespoon of soya sauce. It is ok to add more here because it will be boiled in soup
❷ Soak bee hoon in water for 15 minutes
❸ Boil 1.2L of water with 2 dashi pack (follow instruction on the packaging to boil soup
❹ While waiting for soup to boil, slice bitter gourd into thin slice
❺ Chop tomato into tiny pieces (if you are using raw tomato) or add tomato paste into boiling soup and let it boil for 5 minutes
❻ Add bitter gourd slices and continue to boil for 10 minutes
❼ Add bee hoon and minced pork in small pieces and boil 10 minutes. 
❽ Add 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of soya sauce and is ready to serve
