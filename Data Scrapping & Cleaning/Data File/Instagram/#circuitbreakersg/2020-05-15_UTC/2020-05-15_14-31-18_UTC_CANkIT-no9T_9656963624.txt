Since circuit breaker started, almost everyone I know around me (haha me included) has become chef and/or baker wannabe 🤣⁣
⁣
Bread flour, plain flour, yeast and all the baking essentials are practically out of stock in most supermarkets. Pasta sauces too are like rare commodities these days.⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣
Which in retrospect, is a great thing I would say! That we are learning new skills, attempting to move out of our comfort zone and showing our children too that hey we are also works in progress, like you 😊.⁣
⁣
I have been dabbling into baking quite a bit since the stay home season, for practical reasons. With 2 persistently hungry boys at home the whole day (everyday), means I constantly have to feed them, other than the proper 3 meals, there is also the post breakfast snack, the afternoon tea and horror of horrors, post dinner snack 🥴 So baking is more economical and practical in my home.⁣

The boys love being involved during the process (which means it’s messier and slower but more fun). And today, we attempted an experiment from [OPTIMISTIC: Bravery Magazine Issue 7 – JULIA CHILD + Conversation Guides] to demonstrate how bread has air bubbles in it! (Head to stories to see us in action!)⁣

Raise your hand too if you are seeing yourself baking and/or cooking more! 🖐
