Our digestive system is a crucial part of our body's overall health. It acts as a first line of defense against unwanted organisms that enter our body through a number of factors. Bacteria often get a bad reputation for causing illness and spreading disease. However, in reality, many types of bacteria are not harmful, and some are even beneficial.

What do they do?

The bacteria that lives in our gut does more than you would think. These good bacteria play major roles in the normal functioning of the body1.

Just a few examples of the function of gut bacteria include: - Metabolizes nutrients from food and certain medications. - Serves as a protective barrier against intestinal infections. - Modulate and contribute to gut immune function.

Gut Health

Our gut is lined with about 100 trillion strands of bacteria that harbor more than 1,000 distinct types of strands. They consist of both good and bad bacteria. The types of bacteria within your gut can be affected by diet, age, environment, genes, and medications. When there is an unhealthy balance of bacteria in your system a number of symptoms can arise. These include: an upset stomach, sugar cravings, inconsistent body weight, fatigue, etc. Luckily, there are many solutions to help your gut reach a healthy state.
