For those of you who’re sitting in the comfort of their homes and complaining about the lockdown for not being able to go out, enjoy iftaar parties, meet friends and travel! Please dont, you should be nothing but grateful! 
Please be grateful for whatever you have. I have to move places with a toddler every few weeks. Why? Because we’re basically stranded in Singapore due to the Covid situation. .
.
We had to move to Dxb in March for my husband’s next assignment but we couldn’t because Covid happened. And then our apartment lease expired. Now we’re moving airbnb to airbnb hoping for our lives to get back on track soon. Hope is all we’ve got. Hoping for this airbnb to be our last cuz this is mentally and physically exhausting. People move from one place to another after days of deliberation. We have to do it because we just dont have a choice. . .
I’m grateful for being able to afford to make this move, for having a supportive husband and for having a daughter whose smile just makes me forget about all that I’ve been through during the day! .
.
Stay home, be grateful, cheers!!
