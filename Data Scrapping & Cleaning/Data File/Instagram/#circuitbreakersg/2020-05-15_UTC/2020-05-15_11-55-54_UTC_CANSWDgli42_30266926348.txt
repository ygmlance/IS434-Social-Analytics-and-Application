CB DAY 40 -

Homework day! Completed the work given by school today with a lot of tears.  Josiah is really very stubborn when you formally make him revise. He refuses to answer or even open his mouth when you ask him questions with regards to learning.

But when food is at stake, he can recite 1-12 in English, 1-10 in Chinese, get the right answers for colors, shapes and even tell you complete sentences of who he loves and what fruits he like to eat. 🤦‍♂️ Anyone else facing the same issue and have a solution to it? 😅
