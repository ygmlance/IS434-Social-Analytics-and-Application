⏹🔼Shapes in Web🔽⏺ This helped J with his hand-eye coordination and pincer grasp. And of course, identifying shapes. 🟥🔶🟢
.
.
For this simple activity, I used yawn to thread across a basket with holes at the side, then added cardboard cutouts of shapes for J to identify and pick out! 👶🏻
.
.
He was a little apprehensive to put his fingers in the web at first, but after a few demonstrations he got the hang of it and managed to identify the shapes correctly! .
.
The web can be tightened by adding more yarn to up the difficulty level. ✅
