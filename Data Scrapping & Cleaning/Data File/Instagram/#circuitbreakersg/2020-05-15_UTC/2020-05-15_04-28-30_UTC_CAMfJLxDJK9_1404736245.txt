This one evokes pure nostalgia, as me and my sister did it all the time as kids ❤. It's much fun, and creates the same amount of drama every single time 😊, no matter what the design (or even plain blotches of paint, as in Ruhan's case 😅)! Mirror painting for the win, specially on lazy days when nothing comes to mind, and even if something does, you don't want to do it 🙄. Because all days need not be science experiment worthy, or playdough creation heavy. Some days you're allowed to do just half a painting, and let the fold of the paper and the press of your hand magically make it whole ❤! Minor trouble is: the magic won't last long, as our paints won't either. Looks like in this current period of #lockdown, many a parents have found that perfect refuge in them 😬. Anyhow....just as we finished the whole exercise, Shivin goes: But Mommy, you never gave us the 'mirror' to paint! 🤪🤦‍♀️🤣 #MirrorPainting #painting #arists #kidsofinstagram #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #ShivInDaHouse #Ruhanster
