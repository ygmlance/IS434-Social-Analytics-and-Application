[15. Essential]
It started as therapy for my very weak knees (due to drills and sports), focusing solely on my lower body. Whenever I stopped working out, even for a short period, my knees would start aching, screaming at me to do my exercises.

As time goes by, I slowly included upper body... and then going for classes such as Muay Thai and Yoga. It got to the point that I was working out almost every day, and my knees did not scream at me anymore. I love that I am getting stronger, flexible and perhaps able to defend myself. 
When the Circuit Breaker was implemented, I was upset as gyms closed and classes suspended. While I have been working out at home, its not the same and my knees agree with me (though I have been doing the exercises). However, I have also made the commitment to lead a healthy lifestyle, so I will continue my workouts and count the days that I can return to the gym and classes.
