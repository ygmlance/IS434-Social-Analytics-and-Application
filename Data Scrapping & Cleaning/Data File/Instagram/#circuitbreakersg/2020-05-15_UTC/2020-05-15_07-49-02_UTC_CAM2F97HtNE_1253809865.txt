The new normal: blind wine tasting these fresh, mineral & zesty AlbarinÌƒo / Alvarinho between 5 friends in different households - how?! With a lot of planning, ingenuity, and one person who had to give up the blind cos she was the â€˜central operationsâ€™.
â€¢1st, we drank up mineral water in suitable sized 250ml glass bottles. I had my own various bottles from before, but the rest used Surgiva from @ewineasia (pic 2).
â€¢2nd, determine the coordinating person so bottles & wines can be sent over to one place.
â€¢3rd, @geribean11 carefully blinds the bottles & labels them a few hours before. Then gets a courier to dispatch an hour before our tasting.
â€¢4th, receive chilled wine & get on Zoom for our super fun blind while gossiping about everything else.
ðŸ¥‚
Bonus: keeping the little bottles chilled are a breeze - Tupperware & ice on table (pic 4) takes up the space of a paperback novel ðŸ˜‚ 
For those who are interested, Iâ€™ll put tasting notes in comments.
