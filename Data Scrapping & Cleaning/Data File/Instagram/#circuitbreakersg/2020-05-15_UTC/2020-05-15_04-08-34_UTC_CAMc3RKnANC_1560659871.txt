Life was a breeze during #circuitbreakersg  because of my great kitchen partner - #cuckooricecooker.

Today Im boiling chicken soup in this rice cooker for abt 90 mins or so. Can generate abt 3 bowls ðŸ¥£ of soup. Just right for my small family of 3.

Let me share a tip b4 u boil any pork or chicken ðŸ¥©. *Always put the raw meat in a small pot of boiling water for abt 2mins or so to 'wash off' the dirt from the meat*

Then you transfer the meat into the actual pot of soup that you wish to boil.

Stay safe and healthy! ðŸ’ª
