Attention! This is what's lacking today for me. My mind is so occupied with my back pains that I am struggling to find focus this morning. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Whipped out my trusty EOPR and made this roller in a jiffy. Rolled it on my brainstem and wrists before diving into work again. Next thing I know it's 1:00pm! Amazing how calm I was at working through some heavy-brain-work. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

What's your go-to focus oil or recipe? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
