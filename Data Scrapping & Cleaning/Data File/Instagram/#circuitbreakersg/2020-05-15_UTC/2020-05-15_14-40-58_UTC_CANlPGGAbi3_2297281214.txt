A loaded quick claypot rice meal with chicken wings, waxed meat, lap cheong (Chinese sausage), salted fish, @lechonrepublicsg's lechon and cai xin... Served up with Chinese herbal soup because my typical Cantonese mum reminded me this morning that I haven't boiled Chinese herbal soup to help rejuvenate the body's systems... So like a good Chinese girl, I boiled that soup! üòÖüòã‚ù§Ô∏è
