#circuitbreakersg day 39

Highlight of dinner tonight is the Korean steamed eggs proudly made by the hubs. ðŸ¥š ðŸ˜‚ Along with that are stir-fry of assorted vegetables (yes, we always cook this because need to clear the fridge of food before they turn bad), fried rice and pork ribs soup with kelp. .
.
.
And so, we are at the end of the week already and itâ€™s just slightly over 2 weeks before circuit breaker comes to an end. Canâ€™t believe we have come so far! ðŸ˜¯

Today, Iâ€™m grateful that I have been able to spend my time productively and keep mentally sane during circuit breaker. #gratitudediary
