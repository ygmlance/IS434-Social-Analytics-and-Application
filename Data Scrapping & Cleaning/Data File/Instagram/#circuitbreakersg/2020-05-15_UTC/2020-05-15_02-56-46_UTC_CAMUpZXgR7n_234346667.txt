【Recipe】It never occured to me to use carrot in my baking. Maybe because I’m already using it quite regularly in my dishes. But this recipe turned out better then expected. In fact I’ve already baked it twice. #honeybeesweetsbreadbakes 
Besides the usual loaf, I made Pork Floss Lion buns (kosong inside). Really quite fun to make them, and you can substitute with chicken / fish floss. The kids will love them. #honeybeesweetsfoodfun 
Will share the stories if my baking process later. Sharing the recipe for the bread, have fun baking! #honeybeebakescarrotbread
