These unique Viking Storage Pots are delicately chiseled and crafted from Soapstone, a natural rock found in the Kisii region of Kenya. They make beautiful storage pieces that also work as sculptured art to your interior decor.

Crafting these pieces are quite laborious therefore we have limited pieces coming through. We kept the natural colour of the rock which is also often dyed. We love the natural beauty of this rock because it is almost marble like when polished. The inside is smooth and the external chiseled.
