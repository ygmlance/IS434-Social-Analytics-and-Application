Day 39 of #CircuitBreakerSg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because the nearest coffee shop is 10 minutes away, sometimes it is easier for us to cook rather than to head out to tarpow. But on days when when I don’t feel like cooking or sick of my own cooking, I take out my short cut weapons. In this case, ready sauce to go with my pork. Oriental sauce from @leekumkeesg to be exact. The picture on the packet looks like sweet and sour pork but it’s a bit different. Less sweet and less sour and a bit more savoury. Tasted good though, and a nice change from what we usually have. .
