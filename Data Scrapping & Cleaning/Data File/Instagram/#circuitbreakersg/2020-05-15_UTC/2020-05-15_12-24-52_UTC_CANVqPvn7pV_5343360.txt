Very first Vietnamese dinner at home via @artichoke_sg. Because of #circuitbreakersg there has a lot of delivery options from many eateries which may otherwise be unavailable during normal times. This is definitely one of the sliver linings among the dark clouds.

Makan list
- Chicken soup with herbs
- Potato Salad with Fish Sauce Caramel
- Cold-pressed Hoagie (aka Banh Mi)
- Tofu Slaw
- Lychee & Lemongrass jelly cooler
- Choc pudding w banana, coconut cream and peanuts
