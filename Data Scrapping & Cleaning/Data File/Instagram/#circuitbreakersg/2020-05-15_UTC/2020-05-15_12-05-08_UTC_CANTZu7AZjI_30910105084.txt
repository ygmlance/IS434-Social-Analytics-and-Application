Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 39:
Bought blueberries from the supermarket but it turned out soooooo sour and really hard to eat. Didn't want these blueberries to go to waste and made blueberry buttermilk muffins instead.

The sour blueberries tasted great as it balanced out the sweetness from the buttery fluffy muffins. Couldn't resist gobbling half a muffin even though I'm on a diet! So good!
