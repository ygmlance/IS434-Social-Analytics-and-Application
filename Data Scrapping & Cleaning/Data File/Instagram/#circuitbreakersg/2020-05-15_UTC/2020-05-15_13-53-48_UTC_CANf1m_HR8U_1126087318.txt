I tried to be more productive, tried to read more books but wow, the mind wonders. I've managed to read a few children books, write morning pages every other other day (somewhat) and found myself returning to an evolved comfort zone - I'm cooking more and somewhat illustrating more. This collective effort could not have come at a better time!
A bunch of artists have decided to make a CB (*ahem* lockdown) special. It contains some recipes that would stretch your pantry further with ingredients you might already have!
