Super yummy raspberry mousse / cheesecake @oreo thins! Yes, maybe I’m late to the game, because it’s my first time experiencing how Oreo thins are more crisp and light compared to the normal Oreo
I also thought this raspberry mousse flavour went well with the Oreo biscuit. It was not too creamy as you might fear from the name “mousse”, but tasted plenty like raspberry
The cookies in the box come packaged in two plastic packets. No hard plastic container necessary to separate these thin pieces
Finished this box all in 24 hours. 5/5, will buy again
