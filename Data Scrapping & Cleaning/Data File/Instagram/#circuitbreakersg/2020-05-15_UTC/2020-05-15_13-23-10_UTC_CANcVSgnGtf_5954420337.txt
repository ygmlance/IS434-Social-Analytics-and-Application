More than 5 weeks into the Circuit Breaker and strangely some people are enjoying all the working from home. I enjoy being more focused and productive simply ‘cos there’s nothing else better to do.

I hope you guys are doing ok. If you are in a troubled state for whatever the reasons, hang in there. Wait for the CB to blow over then figure it out with a clear mind, not when it’s clouded with anxiety and doubt.

Two plus weeks more to go. Can’t wait to resume my projects and head for the beach to see my furry friends.
