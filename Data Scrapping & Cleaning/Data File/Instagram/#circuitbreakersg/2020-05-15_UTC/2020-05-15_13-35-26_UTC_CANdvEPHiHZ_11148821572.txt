Did you spot something special? This is an Wacky Request from a Customer. I think this is going to be the most interesting request of Year 2020.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
When I first hear for this request, I ask the Customer twice "Are you sure? This is so funny." She replied, "Yes, let's make a Wacky Design."⁠⠀
⁠⠀
As Baptism Order has all been put on hold due to church closure. Instead of being upset with drop of order, I did rather look at the brighter side by brainstorming how can I make this Wacky request really special.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Day39 Circuit Breaker - Instead of the usual 2D design Wax Tag. I decided to challenge myself to create a 3D Wax Tag. It is an extremely challenging task, as the Wax tag is only 2.5cm wide in diameter. ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Yes, this is fully made with Wax and purely handmade by hand. The wax has to be mold into the desire shape before it cool down. Once it is cool down, the shape is final.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Imagine everything is so small and our hand is so big it is really tough to put them together. Plus you have to fight with time to get everything done before wax cool down.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
I have fail twice and this is the 3rd set. Finally I succeed and I jump up and down shouting "YES YES YES". ⁠⠀
⁠⠀
This wax tag will be used for making a Personalised Carved Candle. Stay tune on Next Week Post for the Carved Candle Photo with this Wacky Wax Tag on it.⁠⠀
