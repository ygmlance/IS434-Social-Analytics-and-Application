When #circuitbreakersg first started (oh so long ago), I couldnâ€™t find spring onions anywhere.  Now they are abundant but I cannot resist grabbing a big bunch when I see them.
The 2 inches near the roots I keep for stir frying.  The middle section is the yummiest and I usually slice up and use for garnishing and dropping extra flavour in soups.
But I had so much extra this time so I grated some ginger, heated up a cup of oil and sizzled it to make ginger scallion sauce that will go on instant noodles, steamed chicken, scallion pancakes...
And I am always loath to throw anything away, so the very greenest top 4 inches, I slow cook in another cup of oil till they turn almost black. Drain and store the golden liquid that i use in place of sesame oil or just to fry other aromatics for extra flavour. Liquid gold.
