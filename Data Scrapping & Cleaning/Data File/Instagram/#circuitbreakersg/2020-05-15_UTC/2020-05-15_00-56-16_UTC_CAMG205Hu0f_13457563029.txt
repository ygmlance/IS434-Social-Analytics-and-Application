🌿 Here’s sharing an indoor nature play idea - I repurposed our nature treasures and dried flowers from @thebloomboxsg , then hung it on our wall.
.
👋🏼 My girl couldn’t stop feeling the textures, rough and soft; and my boy studied the details so intently. I remember, he took a while before gesturing to us in excitement about the discovery. 🥰 How precious!

🌿Children have a wonderful ability to focus and I respect my kids’ concentration by minimal interruptions - I offer silence, make observations, and respond only when prompted.
.
🌿 Our children is growing up in a world of many distractions and they need us to help protect their precious attention.
.
🌿 We can preserve their natural gift of concentration by offering opportunities for uninterrupted focus.
.
🕊 When we honour our children’s ability to concentrate, we prime their lives for contentment - they will transit into adulthood learning that there is no need for an endless pursuit of happiness, just pure joy in the here and now.
