Day 11 Hols = Day 39 of #circuitbreakersg 
303 Tempo Reverse row 
#7dayhomeworkoutchallenge with #heatherrobertsoncom 
Woke up slightly later, had super bad diarrhoea last night and plus having needy kids. #momlife 
But I still made it through to complete the same Hasfit workout on counting reps rather than timing. What is the benefits for counting and going slow? You focus on your form and make sure u put in the effort to do each move. Even though its only 12 rep, but that is effective enough to feel a good workout. 
Today's Heather Robertson's workout is traditional Tabata means 8 rounds of 20 secs work 10 sec rest. 8 ROUNDS! But I survived.. Check my IG stories later.. And focus on the booty.. Still not too bad, I think #blogilates is more brutal cos must do the exercise for 45 sec or even 1min! 
And on the home front, didn't tidy much so today I need to speed through the rest of my things. 
It's Friday already!! #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
