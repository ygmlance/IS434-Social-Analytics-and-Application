🌈All our dreams can come true - if we have the courage to pursue them. 🌈 That’s so true! Somehow, the older we are, the more we are afraid of failures. We become materialistic and calculative of our time and efforts spent vs the gains and results. Let’s remind ourselves constantly to keep things simple. Dreams can be more easily achieved if we start small and improve gradually. The most important thing is to simply get started. 🤣💪 Very recently, in fact just beginning of this week, I start to develop a more conscious interest in fun food art. 😆 So everyday, I will take an extra step to observe the food item I’m going to eat, visualize what it resembles or how it can be conceptualized into a drawing. So, today I’m eating the matcha chiffon cake, which I baked last evening. It’s looks like some field or grassland to me. That’s how I conceptualised today’s drawing. 🥰 The tree leaves are pork floss. The rest of the drawing is hand-drawn using bamboo skewers with Hersey chocolate syrup. The most challenging part is of course drawing that loving couple. ☺️ Quite romantic right? 🤩😎 Also, pairing with Starbucks cappuccino. Have a lovely weekend everyone! TGIF!!! 😘😘😘
