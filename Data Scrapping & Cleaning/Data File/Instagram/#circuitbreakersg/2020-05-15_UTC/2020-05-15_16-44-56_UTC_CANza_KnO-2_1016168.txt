#Circuitbreakersg day 39

Gosh ... it’s been almost 40 days? 
Dinner today : 🔺 🍕 Pizza with home-made dough 
A vegetarian version loaded with tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, basil and arugula leaves. & copious amount of cheese.
🔺 Additional design your own with store bought pizza dough
So fun, simple & delish ~
