It’s perfectly normal to feel sad or lonely at times. These are healthy responses to life’s struggles. However, sometimes the feelings of hopelessness and despair can become overwhelming and such feelings may seriously disrupt a person’s ability to function normally, and last for long periods of time (e.g. weeks to months). In such cases, these symptoms may point towards clinical depression. Help might be needed from a counsellor, psychologist and/or psychiatrist.
