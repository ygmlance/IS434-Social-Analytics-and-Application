[𝑮𝒂𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈] We are nearing the end of #circuitbreakersg in just few weeks more!
.
Many got to spend time with their household members making new memories. Some gained the experience of embracing technology to connect with their friends, keep their business afloat.. while others picked up a new skill! And those who took time to self-meditate gained insights to learn more about themselves. What about you?
.
One thing I'm pretty sure nearly everypawdy around me have gained out of this, is W͜͡E͜͡I͜͡G͜͡H͜͡T͜͡. Not just the hoomans, us puppers too 😶
.
Hoomin freaked out when she weighed me few days back. Turns out I'm 11.2kg ..𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡 𝐼 𝑤𝑎𝑠 9.8𝑘𝑔 𝑏𝑒𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑒 #circuitbreakersg (whopping 1.4kg in 6 weeks!)
.
Only 0.3kg away from getting out of ma ideal weight range = hoomin limiting what I get to eat from now.. but it's all cool - I've already got ma tubtub filled with treatos to last me for awhile ehehehe 🙃
