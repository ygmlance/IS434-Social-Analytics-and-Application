Day 37. The daily temperature is increasing. Humid afternoon is a norm nowadays. We had chicken curry, the scallion pancakes and fried bacon for brunch, prepared by Mr. Meanwhile I was busy cleaning the fridge. Dinner was fish porridge, comfort food. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #spendingtimewithfamily #instadaily
