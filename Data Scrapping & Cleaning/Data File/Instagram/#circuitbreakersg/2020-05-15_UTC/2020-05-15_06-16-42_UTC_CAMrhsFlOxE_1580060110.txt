Avo Smash on Toast
--------------------------------------------
Nothing like getting smashed in the arvo, said the avo. This was a favourite of @hillyong and I. Topped with a runny poached egg and flanked by some roasted cherry tomatoes which were placed in the wrong direction. This long week is almost over and in a few weeks so is circuit breaker. Hang in there!! Looking forward to weekend brunches again be it at home or at cafes. Stay safe everyone!
