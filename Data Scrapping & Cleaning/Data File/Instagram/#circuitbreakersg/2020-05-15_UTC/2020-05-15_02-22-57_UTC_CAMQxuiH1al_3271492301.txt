Things we used to take for granted pre #circuitbreakersg - the freedom to explore.⁣
⁣
Here's a quick #throwback to one of our #grizzlypandadates to check out #TiongBahru and found/tried a number of great gems:⁣
⁣
⭐ #TiongBahruFoodCentre with some kickass old school ice kachang and sweet black carrot cake⁣
⁣
⭐ #TiongBahruGalicierPastry with an array of tantalising kuehs and bakes where even my mom gave a grudging nod of approval towards their kuehs⁣
⁣
⭐ #TiongBahruBakery (@tiongbahrubakery) for their yummy looking croissants (was too stuffed to try them!) and bakes⁣
