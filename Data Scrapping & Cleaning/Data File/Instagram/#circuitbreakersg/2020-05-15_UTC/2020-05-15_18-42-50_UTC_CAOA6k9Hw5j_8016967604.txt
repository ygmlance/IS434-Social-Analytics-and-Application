I grew all your eyes, nose, mouth, hands, feet and every single part of your body in my tummy. Then you came out like how I poo poo ~or so I say to my kids for story time before this afternoonâ€™s nap session

The kids were so intrigued and kept asking me about how I grew them in my tummy!  I am also amazed by how a motherâ€™s body can do all that.

I then described in detail to them about each of my unique labour processes as I have experienced all three signs of labour - abdominal cramping, bleeding and waterbag bursting in my first three pregnancies.  For the fourth pregnancy, I self admitted into the hospital to break my waterbag as my cervix was open, baby refused to exit and SPD (symphysis pubis dysfunction) was tormenting me.

Although this #circuitbreakersg is making everyone go crazy, there are moments whereby the scene of having five kids flash into my mind and the question of whether I can handle a fifth kid came up many times.  Then I get interrupted by kids screaming on top of their lungs and return to my sorry reality of daily unproductivity, crankiness, scoldings, naggings and a string of other repercussions of cabin fever.  There are downs but there are also ups and lots and lots of adorable-ness which pours a thick layer of sweetness over the negativity and recharges me and the cycle repeats itself.

Would I consider having a fifth?  Answer is yes.  I have always wanted six.  Not sure about my husband though, he seems to want to close shop because his time already spread so thin! ðŸ˜†

The only regret I have throughout my pregnancies is not engaging a proper photographer for my maternity shoot.  I would go for it if I had a fifth.  Just take my money. 
Throwback ah, not a recent photo ðŸ“·: my husband
