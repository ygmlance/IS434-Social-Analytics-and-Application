Kenny Dorham - Afro-Cuban, 1957. This album was so ahead of its time merging jazz and Afro-Cuban. Dorham put together an all-star cast for this one, artists including #horacesilver #artblakey #potatovaldes who in later years recorded Latin-inspired jazz. This is a lively album, one that’s great for a Friday to start your weekend off. It’s another one of those must own albums.  #kennydorham #afrocuban #jjjohnson #hankmobley #cecilpayne #oscarpettiford #bluenoterecords
