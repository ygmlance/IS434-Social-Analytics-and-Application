Learned another method from YouTuber - Whimsical Watercolour (only 4 videos loaded) - "Beginner Watercolour Tutorial: Realistic Cup Of Coffee".
Her method for base is wet on wet.  There are a lot "squiggle" between bubbles to add-on colours besides leaving spec of white for each bubble.
Very tedious process .
