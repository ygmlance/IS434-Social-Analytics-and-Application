Winning name for our “Name that Marg Bag contest” *drumroll* >>> The 𝐉𝐮𝐚𝐧 𝐓𝐨𝐨 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐆𝐎𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐚
With an overwhelming number of votes for @rayswayy “MarGOrita” on our post but just as many votes on our IG poll for @thesnappedfork’s “Juan Too Many” we collaborated the names. Winners receive a free #JuanTooManyMarGoRita bag with their next order! (Congrats y’all, DM us to make arrangements) 🍹
