The last time I could remember myself baking, was in Sec 2 Home Econs class. 2 nights ago I decided to try making Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies.. and what an adventure it was. ðŸ˜œ Way too noob and not equipped with the right tools, I consider it a miracle that my cookies made it after all! Storytelling is on the photos that document this memorable experience with the kids, who stayed with me throughout, cheered me on when I thought I couldnâ€™t, and then totally relished my cookie when it was baked the next day (see next post).
