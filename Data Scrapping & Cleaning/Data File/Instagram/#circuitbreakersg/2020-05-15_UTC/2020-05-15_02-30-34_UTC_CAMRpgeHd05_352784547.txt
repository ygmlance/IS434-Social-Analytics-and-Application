Anyone having cooking/baking burnout🔥🤭went on a food delivery spree😂decided to kill many birds with one stone 🐦 1️⃣dim sum craving2️⃣bubble tea craving3️⃣try new places!💕 got @yumchasg x @milksha_sg with min $50 spend and $5 islandwide delivery (+ gst 💰) 🚚
...
My honest review is that dim sum is still best eaten hot on the spot🙈the food came slightly cold and sticky, I got to say for the price it’s bit pricey for the quality of food🙊 ⚠️so I will point out the key hit and miss items⚠️
...
✅salted egg custard Bao (it flows👍) ✅prawn mango sesame roll (yums!) ✅crystal paper chicken (salty savory✨) ❌scallop pea dumpling and squid ink dumpling (taste sticky cold🙅‍♀️) ❌rice flour roll (no photo cos it looks really bad and end up chewy hard? How? 🙅‍♀️)
...
Overall I will say for dim sum delivery, don’t expected too much and choose your items wisely😋 and think bout your bubble tea delivery savings at the same time😂
