Happy me, because I've got yummy in hand! ⠀

I am surprised that I like Burnt White Chocolate as I'm not really a white chocolate lover. It tasteS delightfully better than how it sounds. 😋 There is a slight nutty crunch in texture and tasted more like creamy/milky chocolate than white chocolate. Or am I being happily confused? 😂⠀
⠀
This Ispahan probably gets my vote amongst the many "lychee rose renditions" that I've tried because it's nothing like Bandung. No Bandung for me 🙈. I enjoy the refreshing lychee and sour raspberry twist that shared the centerstage, balanced with gentle rose notes. ⠀

I'm impressed. ☺️⠀ ⠀
