Some of our pretty #libertylondon #fabricmasks being despatched this weekend. So far, this collection has been produced on special requests only. Many people have been asking when we can start to take preorders. So to answer to this question, we will open for preorders at 11pm tonight! Orders will be limited to only 5 pieces per design. Visit our #Etsyshop in bio to check them out later! 😍 .
