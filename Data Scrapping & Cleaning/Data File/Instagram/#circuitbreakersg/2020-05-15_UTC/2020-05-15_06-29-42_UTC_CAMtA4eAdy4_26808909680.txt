#throwback to Mother's Day - Daddy brought me along to buy sumptuous dinner for the napping Mummy 🤭 Daddy was drenched in sweat 🥵 #babywearing me hahah~ And we were shocked to see every single stall has such looooong queues!! But it was all worth it as Mummy had her cravings of stingray and petai satisfied and she finished her rice after so long 😋 ⁣

(Mummy: Had really little bit of stingray only. But rice yes hahha finished all the rice with much regrets because the gagging started thereafter 🙄 This pregnancy is controlling my food intake well 😅) ⁣
