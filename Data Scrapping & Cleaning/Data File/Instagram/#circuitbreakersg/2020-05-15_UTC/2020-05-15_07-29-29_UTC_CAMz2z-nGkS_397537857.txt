#CircuitBreakerSG D-39

Our quick lunch today is Yakisoba (Japanese Stir-fried Noodle). Cooked the noodle with Onion, Carrot, Leek & Pork Belly, topped with pan-fried White Shrimps.

These white shrimps ü¶ê from @ApolloMarineSeafood are so fresh & sweet that a pinch of salt is all you need to bring out the flavour.

Visit Apollo Marine at Seletar or shop online www.apollomarine.com.sg/shop. Free delivery to your doorstep for purchase above $50.
