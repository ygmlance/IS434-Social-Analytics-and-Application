Happy Friday, peeps!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
🎉 We have survived 6 weeks of the Circuit Breaker! :) how have you guys been coping?⁣⁣

So far, setting aside some me-time with @netflixsg 📺 and a Matcha Latte treat 🍵 in hand has been keeping us sane (anyone else here loves Money Heist?). ⁣
⁣
On days when we have more time, we try brewing our Matcha with some oat milk in a pretty cup - which can quite therapeutic 😌⁣

It's important to not blur the lines between work and rest, even though it's pretty tough when you are home 🏡 all the time.⁣⁣

Take care, everyone! 💚
