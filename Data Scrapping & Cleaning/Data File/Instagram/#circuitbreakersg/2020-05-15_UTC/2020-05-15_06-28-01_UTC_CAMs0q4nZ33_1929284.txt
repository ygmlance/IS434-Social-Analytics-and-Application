CB Day 39 of 56. Today’s fuss-free Homecooked meal is Bak Ku Teh ( 肉骨茶), using a Bak Ku Teh pack given by an ex co-worker from Malaysia quite some time ago. Was told that this is good and it is really not bad!  It has more of the herbal taste than the peppery taste. Not sure if this brand can be found in Singapore though.
