Booty Basics!⠀
⠀
Sometimes keeping your workouts simple & sticking to the basics is the most effective. They are definitely around for a GOOOOD reason! Here are my top 4 glute exercises you will ALWAYS catch me doing! Usually I’ll pick 1-2 & add them into my lower body workouts. I also add bands into all of these exercises to increase glute engagement 🍑.⠀

1️⃣Banded Kickbacks-Another great variation is a cable kickback! I love finishing up my lower body workouts w/ these and just doing 1-2 sets of AMRAP.⠀
⠀
2️⃣Glute bridges-These I like to go heavy w/ usually & use a barbell. I always do either glute bridges or Hip thrusts every lower body day.⠀
⠀
3️⃣Goblet squats-To get the best glute engagement follow my cue in this video & point your toes outwards, wide stance & add a band!⠀
⠀
4️⃣Hip Thrusts-One of my favourite ways to do hip thrusts is using the smith machine (when I have a gym 😅) that way I am more comfortable to go heavy! Focus on pushing your knees outwards w/ the bands.⠀
