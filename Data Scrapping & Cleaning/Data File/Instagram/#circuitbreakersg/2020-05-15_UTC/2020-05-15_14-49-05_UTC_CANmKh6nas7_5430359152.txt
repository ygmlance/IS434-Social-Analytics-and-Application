Painted my favourite cafe latte and they are ready to leave my hands. Sending them out to cheer some friends up since we are all cooped up at home due to Covid-19. Can't wait to hang out with these gals over coffee once it is safe to have social gathering.

Stay safe and healthy peeps! We are all in this together.
