Theme: Fast and furious 🏎 
Budget: ~$80 (for 2 pax)

|Spicy, exciting and easy to eat.|
.
Spicy - how I would describe the Tom yam goong. There’s a real kick to it!
.
Exciting - who wouldn’t be excited when presented with such a spread?
.
Easy to eat - so easy we polished it all up too fast!
. 
What a cray busy week it has been at work...a fast and furious lunch was just what I needed! 😌
