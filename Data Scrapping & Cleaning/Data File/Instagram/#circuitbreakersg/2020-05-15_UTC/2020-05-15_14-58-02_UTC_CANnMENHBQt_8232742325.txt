Today I tried cooking Emperor Herb Spice Chicken for the first time and it was a succulent success. I had to clean out the cavity and there was lots of fats in it. And I had to scream to my dad for help to cut off the head because I am deathly afraid of chicken heads and their translucent eyelids. Anyway, here is my pale fat boi. #yum #marrymechanyeol #butyouhavetohelpcutchickenhead #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #fatboi #paleboi
