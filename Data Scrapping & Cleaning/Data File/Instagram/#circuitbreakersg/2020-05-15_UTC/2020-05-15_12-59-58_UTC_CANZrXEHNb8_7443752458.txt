Ok, I get it. Fish face curry will never look objectively delicious. But once you know, you know. Major cravings were satisfied this afternoon. Turns out, you donâ€™t need a bunch of friends to go out and eat a pot of #fishheadcurry with. Ya just need a spoon. I ate the whole head by myself and feeling rather smug about it. Saved some of the gravy to enjoy later as well. Yummmmm #sgfood #curry #sgfoodies #homemade #quarantinecooking #circuitbreakersg #covidcooking #singaporeanfood #rice #foodporn #foodstyling #uglydelicious #foodphotography #foodstudio
