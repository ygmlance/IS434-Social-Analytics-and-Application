Foam roller exercises for chest stretch and tensor fascia latae (TFL) 👍🏼
.
Chest stretch: hold for 1-2mins, repeat 2-3 times a day

1) If you don’t have a foam roller you can roll a towel up and place this underneath your back instead. 
2) Reach your arms out to the side keeping them straight with your palms facing up. 
3) If you don’t feel much with this stretch then bend your elbows to 90 degrees and keep them in line with your shoulders and try to drop your hands and elbows at the same time towards the ground without flaring your ribcage or arching your back.
.
TFL: repeat the roll 4-5 times before switching to the other side

1) Start by lying with the roller under your left hip, bend your right leg and place your right foot firmly on the floor. 
2) Use your right foot to roll your body up and down the Grid. ❗If you feel an area of soreness, pause over this for 20 seconds to relieve the tension
