“By awesome deeds you answer us with righteousness, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas;
the one who by his strength established the mountains, being girded with might; 
who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, the tumult of the peoples, 
so that those who dwell at the ends of the earth are in awe at your signs. You make the *going out of the morning and the evening to shout for joy* 🌅 .” - Psalm 65:5-8

“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, *in the things that have been made* 🌅. So they are without excuse.
For although they knew God, they did not honour him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools,
and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.” - Romans 1:18-23
