When I run out of prawn for my laksa, I was lucky to find my frozen breaded tempura prawn in the freezer. The prawns are so crispy and delicious. 
Ok I know what u guys thinking. The prawns that I added look like ppl go 拜拜🙏🏻. LOL That’s how my wife told me the same 🙄😂😂 .

The breaded tempura prawn that I ordered from Frozendozen is so easy to cook. Just 2 minutes deep fry or 10 minutes airfry straight from freezer and you can enjoy piping hot crispy tempura prawns.
