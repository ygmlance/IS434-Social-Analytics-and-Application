#Circuitbreakersg Day 39
.
Throwback to yesterday's walk with Mummy Mok led by our stomachs
. 
MM: You mean we walked all the way here to eat this?
Me: No, we have to walk all the way here in order to eat this
.
Took a 6.6km walk with mum with the end goal of Old Airport Road Hawker Centre in mind. Got caught in a downpour, had to seek shelter but ended up still walking when the rain lightened
.
Dinner was Michelin Guide 2019 老夫子 Char Kway Teow, Wanton Mee and Nyonya Chendol - the walk was certainly worth it
