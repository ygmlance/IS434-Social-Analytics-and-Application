DAY 38, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
Mille Crepe Cake
Topped with fresh Mango, fresh cream icing and mango jelly.

Birthdays are special, and should be celebrated in a special way. And if it falls during Covid times, its just a blessing to be with family. 
Totally enjoyed making this crepe cake. I have to admit that it takes patience to make a cake like this, but the effort is worth it if it is enjoyed
