Braised Pork Trotter Beehoon is probably a dish most of our mums or grandmas have made for us. There’re many renditions out there but my Mum’s version remains my favourite. It’s just canned braised pork trotters, cabbage & fine beehoon, with additional oyster sauce and dark soy sauce to taste. It’s another of my childhood taste, and I’m glad I’ve succeeded at replicating it. 💪🏻 .
