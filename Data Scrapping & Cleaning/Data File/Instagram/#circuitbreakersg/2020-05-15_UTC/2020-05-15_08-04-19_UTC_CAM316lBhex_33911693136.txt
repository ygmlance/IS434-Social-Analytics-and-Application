In an ideal world, our mornings start by brewing some coffee, listening to our favorite podcast, and getting in a few minutes of relaxation before kicking off the work day. 💭In this new reality we live in, that’s not so easy. The coffee’s brewing and suddenly you’re being pulled into video conferences and answering calls. 😪That’s where we come in. Keep your coffee warmer as you pace from kitchen, to living room, to bedroom with our Ceramic Mug! 🧚🏼☕️
