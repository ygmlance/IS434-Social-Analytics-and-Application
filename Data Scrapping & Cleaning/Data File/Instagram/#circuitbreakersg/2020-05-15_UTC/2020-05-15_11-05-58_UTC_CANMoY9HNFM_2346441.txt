Day 39 of #circuitbreaker: Cracking my head on how to keep my kids meaningfully busy during the sch hols. 2 more weeks....😅⁣
@kitsingapore_en has came up with online camps! Thank you for keeping them entertained for close to 3 hrs 😃 I can get busy with other things. The camp is conducted according to their age group - suitable for 6 yrs - 14 yrs :) ⁣
⁣
Learn Maths, Science, Drama etc at the comfort of your home, what I love about online learning is we don’t have to travel out! 😉⁣
⁣
Sophie had fun learning Maths & Drama, while Ian chose Drama & Science 🌟Their teacher made sure they are following the classes too so u don’t have to worry :)⁣
⁣
Swipe to see their schedule & trial fees :) Another enrichment for you to consider :)⁣
