Reposted from @bryanahuang  GIVEAWAY TIME!! ðŸ¥³

I have been using @cherbeautysgâ€™s DVZ Haircare Set for a week. Personally, I feel that it has helped with fizziness & dryness of my hair, leaving it silky soft & smells extremely pleasant after using it! (Psst. smells very similar to Chanel Chance Eau Frauchie Perfume). I have yet to see any hair growth since itâ€™s only been a week.
