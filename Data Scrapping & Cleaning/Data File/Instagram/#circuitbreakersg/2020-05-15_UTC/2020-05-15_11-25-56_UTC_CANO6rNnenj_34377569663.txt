#Art4SGMW: Our crowd funding site is up! (https://rayofhope.sg/campaign/art4sgmw/) We are so happy to announce that we have received many heartfelt art contributions since the launch of the #Art4SGMW campaign. We are now sourcing for donations for art care-packs. Each care-pack costs $15 and includes a sketch book, postcards, oil pastels, colour pencils, a pencil, markers, an eraser, a sharpener, postage stamps and a ziplock bag. 
With your help, we hope to meaningfully engage our migrant friends with art and have them share their artworks online. This will create a safe healing space for our migrant friends and the public to have some form of interaction and dialogue through art. This can enhance their emotional well-being and it will also give them a metaphorical platform to express themselves in creative outlets.

No contribution is too little. Please check out our campaign website and donate any amount you can. Let us help our migrant friends and our nation heal together.
