Hungarian Chicken Paprikash Soup with Sourdough Bread

Paprika is the symbol of Hungarian Cuisine. 
Here it is infused with chopped onions , and chicken breast, capsicums and mushrooms added to it. The soup can be enriched with greek yoghurt / sour cream.

Homemade Sourdough Bread is a perfect fit with this savory, tangy and spicy soup so good to the last drop ðŸ˜‹
