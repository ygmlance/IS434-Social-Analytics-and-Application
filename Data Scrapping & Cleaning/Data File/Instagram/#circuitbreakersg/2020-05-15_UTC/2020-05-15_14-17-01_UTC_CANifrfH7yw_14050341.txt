Glam Nude make up. Usually called one tone 
What does it mean? Using your blusher as the same single tone eyeshadow for ur eyes. 
Of course you use ur shading powder for the base to create more dimension followed up a dark brown or ask brown colour to transition between ur gel liner and ur lids

And ur lip colour is of the same rosy tone

Another great session!
