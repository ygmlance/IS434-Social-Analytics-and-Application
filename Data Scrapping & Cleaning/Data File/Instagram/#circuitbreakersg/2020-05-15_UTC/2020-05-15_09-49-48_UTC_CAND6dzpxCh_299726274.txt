Home roasted char siew (Chinese bbq pork). Marinade overnight and roast / broil over approximately 40 minutes. If you have an oven at home, you really don't need to eat char siew outside anymore. #charsiew #roastpork #dinner #foodphotography #foodblogger #circuitbreakersg #stayathome #ovenroasted #theroastsociety
