Don Quijoteâ€™s Paella Negra is the dish perfect for the weekend.

Our paella arroz, or paella rice, arenâ€™t pre-inked, and the squid-ink comes from our contracted fisherman who harvest the ink from freshly caught squid! And the difference is day and night! One is briny, and the latter is saltyðŸ˜§
