~ Bulgogi Minced Beef ~ We had a late lunch so I thought of making something easy, something which we can use tomorrow as well. The kids' version is definitely lighter because I didn't use any soya sauce at all. It's flavoured with the classic korean marinade of asian pear, apple, onion, garlic. Topped with some chopped vegetables and served over multigrain rice, it's an easy weeknight meal. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #beefbulgogi #koreanfood #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
