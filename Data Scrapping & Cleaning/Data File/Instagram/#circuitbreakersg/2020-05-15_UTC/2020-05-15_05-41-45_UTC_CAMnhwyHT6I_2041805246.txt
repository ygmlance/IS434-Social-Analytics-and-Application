Flower arrangements has always been something I wanted to try for a long time. Me and @chui_jia was talking to about flowers yesterday, and her being her, she managed to find a florist that does flower subscription in SG. And so I subscribe to it..
.
It does trains my patience doing up the arrangements as it took me an hour! 😓 .
Flowers do brighten up my day. Loving it. 😍 Love the colours of my flowers too.
