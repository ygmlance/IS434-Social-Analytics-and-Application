In the morning of 15-May-2020, our P1 son tried hard to teach his little sister (who will join a #MOEkindergarten by @MOESingapore next year) to read by playing a "lost letter" activity from @publiclibrarysg, but she did not pay enough attention so he was unhappy. In the afternoon, our little daughter happily helped his big brother to wipe his window grills while his brother was trying to solve a math problem. I am patiently waiting for the air-condition cleaning service to come after the #lockdown. Meanwhile, I am thankful that our little children tried their best to help hanging clothes, sweeping and mopping floors, wiping dust away, etc. Our son imagines mopping floors as exercising or writing calligraphy. Hope that they appreciate cleaners even more than ever! #ThankYouCleaners @NEA  #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe#StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious
