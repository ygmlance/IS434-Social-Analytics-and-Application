Ulysse Collin Blanc De Blanc Extra Brut. Nose-apple, pear, ripe peach, apricot, citrus, orange conserve, honey, vanilla and brioche. Palate- Deep, rich yet the acidity was still sharp. It lingers long enough with endless layers of fruit and texture. It’s perfect to drink now but will benefit more from aging. Paired with Korean seafood japchae and soondae guk (pork sausage soup) and it didn’t kill each other like a perfect marriage! (It suddenly reminds me of K-drama called “the world of marriage” 🤔) Champagne cut down the grease of stir fried noodle and it went well with some savouriness and gamy flavour from soondae (pork sausage) due to its high acidity and mineral. The most importantly it’s TGIF ! 🤩 Chloe’s Score 4.1/5 available @artisan.cellars  #wine #winelover #winetime #winestagram #wineofinstagram #sgwines #sgwinelover #champagne #champagnelover #ulyssecollin #ulyssecollinlespierrieres #circuitbreakersg #lockdown #day39 #와인 #와인스타그램 #와인추천 #와인러버 #와린이 #와알못 #샴페인 #샴페인스타그램 #싱가폴 #싱가폴라이프 #싱가폴일상 #락다운 #집콕 #집콕일상 #클슐랭 #클슐랭테이스팅
