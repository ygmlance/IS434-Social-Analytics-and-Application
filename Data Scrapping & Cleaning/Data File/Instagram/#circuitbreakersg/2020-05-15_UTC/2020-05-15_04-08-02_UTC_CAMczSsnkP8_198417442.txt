💖Legs workout💖

Lifting heavy using momentum isn’t the most effective way to build the right muscles. Always remember to go slow and controlled to build muscle mind connection. I maintained constant tension throughout the following 3 exercises by not letting my hips touch the ground. And I also practiced pause rep at the point of contraction at the top to increase time under tension to trigger muscle growth. 🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️ ✅Hip Thrust - staple for growing glutes especially for those who are quad dominant like me. I feel that it targets my glutes more than normal squats. And I haven’t done normal squats since more than a year? 🤔 ✅Glute Bridge - also targets the glutes. 
Same as the hip thrust you will notice that my knees are at approx 90 degrees at the top. If my feet is too far away, I feel more at my hamstring, and if my feet is too near by butt, I feel more on my quads. 🌟But everyone’s anthropometry is different. Shift your feet in or out according till you feel more on your glutes. ✅Fit Ball Hamstring Curl - you can do this with socks if you do not have a fit ball but the range of motion is larger with a fit ball. 
Spot the thief in the video. 🤣
✅Side walk with my pretty leopard print glute band from @priow_pro_style. 💓 🌟Remember to not cave your knees in when you do side walk so that you fully activate your glutes! 
Also did cable kick back and shoulders workout after but not recorded.
