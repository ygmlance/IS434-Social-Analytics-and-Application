When some pple out there, thought i work 8-5 just for my own needs. But they dont even see this Circuit Breaker been making my life rush over to send and fetch my boys to/from school as the school end till 6pm. Both me and my husband are essential workers. 
Ps to sore eyes chief:
 When working shift mummy requested 8-5 due to CB, its always with a strong reason. 
Anyway, I did submit memo to the top level.
