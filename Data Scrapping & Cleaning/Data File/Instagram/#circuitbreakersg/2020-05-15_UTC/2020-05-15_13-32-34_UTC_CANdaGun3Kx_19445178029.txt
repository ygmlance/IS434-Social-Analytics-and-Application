I used to think that being a jack of all trades is pointless. Is it of any use if you know everything but is a master of none? But this pandemic taught me otherwise. Diversification is key - not just in terms of your investment choices but your skill sets too. Iâ€™m not surprise if side hustling would be seen as a norm. Itâ€™s perfectly fine to pursue a rainbow of dreams. And kids, you donâ€™t have to grow up thinking about that one occupation youâ€™ve dreamt of because in future, youâ€™ll get to create your ideal job and even customise your career path. And I shall stop asking you what you want to be in future. .
