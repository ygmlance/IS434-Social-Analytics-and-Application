It's Friday! Honestly the days don't make a lot of difference since we're all practically home everyday⁣

Made some Houjicha Latte by whisking 2 teaspoon of houjicha powder with roughly 4-5 tablespoons of hot water. ⁣
⁣
Add to your desired amount of milk and enjoy the smoky/roasty flavour of houjicha!
