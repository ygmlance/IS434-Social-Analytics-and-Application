We have sold out for deliveries on the 20th May! Really grateful for the overwhelming responses thus far, and we can’t wait to serve you bolder and batter (better, geddit geddit). 👊🏻
Bear with us for the time being as we’re operating from a small-scale home kitchen and trying to open up more delivery slots within the week in order to satisfy your sweet cravings. 
Thank you for the patience, and for being such supportive troopers! 🙌🏻❤️ We’ll announce our next delivery drop date very soon 😉
