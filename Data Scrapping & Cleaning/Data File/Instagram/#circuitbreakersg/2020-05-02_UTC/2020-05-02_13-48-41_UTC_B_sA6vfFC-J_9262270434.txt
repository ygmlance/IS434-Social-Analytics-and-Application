Marina Bay Sands is an iconic part of Singapore's skyline and most popular among tourists.

Does any one else miss the beautiful city lights at night..?

How can the night become art in some cities, like Singapore..?? ..
There were some days, we just used to go to promenade or merlion park just to enjoy the singapore skyline.. and to have some pleasant time with cool breeze around.. Miss those days..!!
