Day 26 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Labour Day Virtual 3km run

This year, I told myself, I won't spend money on any races, even though they can hold great accountability cos u put your money in.. So I was introduced this app through a colleague I think a year or 2 back then, 42race #notsponsored and they have both paid and free races (just like Strava too). I find their paid races really cheap, and they will actually send u a physical medal that is so nicely designed! I wouldn't mind having one or a few but I don't have place to put the medals so... The virtual medals will do me fine. 
I see so many people running to keep fit, but remember to do safe distancing as well k.. I had to run on the grass many times today to avoid being so close to all these people.. So everyone please #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
