L o n g  R i d e⠀
⠀
First 50km ride and first (almost) 2 hour effort in quite some time.⠀
⠀
To be honest, felt pretty hard, but glad to have gotten it done. Was a little boring too, as I'm just doing loops of the neighbourhood (4 in total today) but need to make sure I'm doing my bit to obey the current circuit breaker restrictions here in Singapore.⠀
⠀
Legs are feeling a bit jelly after that, so will be making sure to rest and recover for the rest of the day.⠀
⠀
Happy weekend everyone!⠀
