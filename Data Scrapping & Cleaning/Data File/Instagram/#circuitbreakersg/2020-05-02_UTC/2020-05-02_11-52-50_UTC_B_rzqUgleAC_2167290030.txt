DAY 26 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
SPICY CHICKEN WRAPS

Another easy recipe today. With days that seem so long, and three meals to cook, it becomes too much work sometimes. Not to mention other household chores 🙄 I am not complaining, but if meals can be made quick & easy, it really helps. I have been doing quick meals almost all of April, and today was no different.

So I started with grinding together
🔹️ A small bunch of coriander (Dhania)
🔹️ 2 green chilli - you can add more if you can handle the heat
🔹️ One small onion 🔹️ 2-3 flakes of garlic
🔹️ 1 tbsp lemon juice

Then I marinated about 400 grams of boneless chicken (cut into bite size pieces) in ....
🔹️ the coriander paste
🔹️ 1tbsp ghee
🔹️ 1/2 tsp salt
🔹️ 1/4 tsp chaat masala
🔹️ 1/2 tsp coriander pwd (dhania pwd)
Marinated the chicken for 30 min, then cooked it in a non-stick pan.
Made a slaw with shredded carrot, tomato, onion, cabbage & mayo.
Also used some lettuce in the wraps.
