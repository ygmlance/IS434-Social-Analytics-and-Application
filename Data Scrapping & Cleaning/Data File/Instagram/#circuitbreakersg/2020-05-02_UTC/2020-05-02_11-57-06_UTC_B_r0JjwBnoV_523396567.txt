🏡 Downsized from 4-RM to 3-RM, Fully Paid❗️⠀
⠀
Yesterday I spoke about how downsizing could help you with your financial dilemma. And it’s very timely that my client recently downgraded successfully. So let me share with you her story ☺️⠀
⠀
Auntie has been staying alone ever since her hubby passed away and she has been maintaining the house on her own. ⠀
⠀
After much discussion, she decided to relocate from Jurong East to Ang Mo Kio to be closer to her children. Since her house is fully paid for, she wants to downgrade to a smaller home and have the remaining cash for her retirement. ⠀
⠀
It has been difficult for her married children to travel to and fro as they have their own family commitments and work. ⠀
⠀
So with this shift, everyone gets to be close to one another and can attend to emergencies faster and easier. Alhamdulillah..⠀
⠀
Special thank you to Agent Akhbar @md_akhbar_property_hdb_pte and Kak Jawi @jawisallim from Synergy from ERA for the collaboration and for bringing their buyer to purchase my seller's unit❗️Thank you very much❗️⠀
⠀
⠀
Stay safe, stay healthy and stay home everybody 🙆🏻‍♂️⠀
