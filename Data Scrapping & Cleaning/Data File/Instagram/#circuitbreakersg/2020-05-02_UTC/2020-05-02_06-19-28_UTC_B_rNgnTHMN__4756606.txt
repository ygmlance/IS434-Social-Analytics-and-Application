ðŸ˜»Day 26/56â€¢StayHome Lunch 
Heee ..so you saw my story of Kbros different meal requests? Such things do happen...it's ok, Mama grant their wish today! "Anyhow" Asian pasta under 3 happy kitties with Lemon-Olive Oil Salmon. 
I gotten my salmon from @haisiaseafood and very please with the quality! They just launched a "All Time Fav" bundle, in time for the upcoming Mother's Day! So you can order & surprise your Wife, Mum, MiL! 
Haha! I'm going to order mine too!

Recipe for Lemon-Olive Oil Salmon:
1 piece of salmon 
2 tsp Olive Oil 
Â½-â…” tsp Salt 
Light sprinkle of Sugar & Pepper 
2 Lemon slices

Rub seasoning all over salmon
ðŸ‘‰This can be put into ziplock bag & freeze, it's my freezer-stash recipe!
Remove lemon & panfry, airfry or grill in oven...put lemon back onto fish at the last 2 minutes of cooking.
