#hellomay  It’s a #stayhome month in #circuitbreakersg and I didn’t work yesterday as it was labour day. I thought I should not work on this public holiday. I slept, rested, watched video, made payment for my Taobao purchases to be shipped back, watched more videos, hugged my kids and watched Korean drama with my hubby. What a day which I didn’t work at all! It’s quite nice though. This May will be a busy but hopefully not a tough month. Let’s see how it goes! May it be a smooth month! #ftwm #noworklifebalance #sgblogger
