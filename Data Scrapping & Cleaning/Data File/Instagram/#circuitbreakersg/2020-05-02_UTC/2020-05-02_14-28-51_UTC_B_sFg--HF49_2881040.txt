It's nasi lemak today coz I had some coconut milk left from yesterday's pandan chiffon baking! A healthier version cooked with rice blend, accompanied with egg omelette, pan fried mackeral, stir fry french beans, fried ikan bilis & store bought sambal (didnt want to get the whole house smellyðŸ™…) I must say the store bought sambal is really quite nice ~ spicy with a tinge of sweetness.ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
