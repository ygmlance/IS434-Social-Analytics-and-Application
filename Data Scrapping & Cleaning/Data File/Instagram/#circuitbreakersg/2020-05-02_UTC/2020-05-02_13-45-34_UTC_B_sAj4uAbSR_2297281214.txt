Fall-off-the-bone BBQ ribs with a side of mac & cheese and salad with Persian feta...
Tried my new homemade BBQ marinade concoction and then attempted to cook the ribs two different ways.  One lot were in the pressure cooker (as suggested by a good friend) before finishing them off in the oven and one lot were slow cooked in the oven for 3 hours.  The racks in the pressure cooker worked a treat to retain the meat juices better as opposed to the racks that were in the oven for 3 hours... Grateful to learn new things every day! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
