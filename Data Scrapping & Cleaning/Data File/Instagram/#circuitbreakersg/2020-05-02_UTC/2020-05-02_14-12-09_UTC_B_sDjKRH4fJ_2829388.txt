𝓟𝓵𝓪𝔂 𝓹𝓻𝓮𝓽𝓮𝓷𝓭 💇‍♂️ Another 1st in our relationship, milestone? 🤣 my husband cant wait till 12may so he entrusted his haircut to me. I'm super excited & confident and only skimmed through 2 videos on YouTube. BUT... I'm not joking if I say I was super nervous during the haircut. 🙎‍♀️ "what if I cut a hole how?" 🙎‍♂️ "then will be my turn to cut yours!" Hahahaha! 
I can say "nubbad laaaa" 🤭 give chance la, my 1st haircut in my life. Thank you 老公! 😘
