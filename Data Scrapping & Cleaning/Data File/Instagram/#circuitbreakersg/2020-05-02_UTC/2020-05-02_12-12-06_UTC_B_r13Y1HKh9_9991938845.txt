“Claypot” chicken brown rice cooked in rice cooker , coz I did yoga while the rice cooker was working .... Pros: don’t have to watch the fire & can do other things while rice is cooking in the cooker . Still taste good though. Cons: don’t get the crispy rice like claypot . Added salted fish to enhance taste... #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #homecooked #claypotchickenrice #igfood #foodie #foodporn #sgparents #momlife
