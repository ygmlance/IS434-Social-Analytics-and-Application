Never have these been so intensively used in their life with me. I have grown to use them daily now that I am home everyday. My home workout kit includes my tablet/phone, 3-year-old bluetooth Creative speaker, spare army towel, Decathlon exercise mat and favourite gym apparels (prAna or Vivre Activewear). I like to cast some workouts on TV sometimes too. I think I am just missing a poster of Hyun Bin only. 😍 What is your workout set-up like at home? 😉
