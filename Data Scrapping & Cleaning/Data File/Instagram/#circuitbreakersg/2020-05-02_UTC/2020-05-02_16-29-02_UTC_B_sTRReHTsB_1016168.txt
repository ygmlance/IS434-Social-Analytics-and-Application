#Circuitbreakersg day 26

A national favourite for many. The allure of a coconut cream infused steamed rice with fried and spicy accompaniments. Can’t go wrong, right?😂 Dinner was : 🔺Nasi Lemak with fried chicken wings, egg sambal tumis, sayur goreng, fried tumeric ikan kuning, ikan bilis, peanuts .... 🔺 freshly brewed pandan, lemongrass & butterfly pea drink, with a slice of lemon 🍋 ~
