꧁Teochew Cuisine꧂
🕖Dinner:
-Stir fry Chinese Broccoli(kai lan) and Beef with Rice Noodle(kway Teow) in Satay Sauce，潮汕沙茶牛肉炒粿条，a classic and must have dish whenever I’m back home.

The gravy is deliciously savoury in this dish with flavour from the beef, kai lan, tomatoes and of cos, the satay sauce, soy sauce on top of the fried kway teow.
