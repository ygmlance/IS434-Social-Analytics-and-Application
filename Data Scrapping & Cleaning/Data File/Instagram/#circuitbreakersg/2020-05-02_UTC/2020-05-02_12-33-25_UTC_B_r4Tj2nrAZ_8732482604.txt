M: (Looking at her bowl of noodles) Your prawn look so yummy, can give me one?
*
D: No (giving that kind of unwilling look)
*
M: I make #chawanmushi whenever you request for it leh.
*
D: Okay, you make chawanmushi for dinner, I give you one prawn.

In the end, I didn't take the prawn yet proceed to steam egg (pumpkin egg custard)
