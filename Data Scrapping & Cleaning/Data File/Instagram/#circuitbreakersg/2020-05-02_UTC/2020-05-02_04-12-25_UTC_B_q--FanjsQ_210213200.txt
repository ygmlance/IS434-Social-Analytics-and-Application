Throwback to the last HIIT before i got hit by the virus. Yes the COVID-19 virus. (No idea how i got it) My “covid journey” hasn’t ended but i am touched by everyone’s kind words and gestures. It is a trying time but there are others out there who are having it worst. My heart goes out to them. Keep fighting. 💪🏻 Meantime, imma stay positive (in spirits) and look forward to the day my test results turn negative 🙏🏻 .
