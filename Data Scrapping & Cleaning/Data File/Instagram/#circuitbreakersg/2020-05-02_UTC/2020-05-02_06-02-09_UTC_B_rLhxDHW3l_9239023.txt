When children mindfully trace, they improve their visual-spatial skills, and their fine motor skills. This skillset that children pick up while tracing can help them later with both math and reading. Tracing also gives children a confidence boost as they see a complete drawing that is visually accurate! Tracing is an excellent way for kids to learn to draw too!
