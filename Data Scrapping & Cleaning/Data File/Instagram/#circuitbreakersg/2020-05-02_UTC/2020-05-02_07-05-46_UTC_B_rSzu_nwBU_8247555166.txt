Magnum chocolate cake batter - Vanilla ice cream, chocolate cake batter flavoured sauce, coated in chocolate and cookie pieces! 🍦

Omg the triple layered coating for the vanilla ice cream is 😍! What’s more the middle layer is kind of semi molten. So luscious and I love the crunch from the cookie pieces. Not cloyingly sweet overall, but definitely a decadent treat! 🍫

Thanks @mysweetlittletooth for tempting me! 😂
