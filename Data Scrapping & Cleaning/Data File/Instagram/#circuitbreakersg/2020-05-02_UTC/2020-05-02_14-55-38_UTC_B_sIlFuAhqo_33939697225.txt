I decided to have something simple for dinner so that there is more time to play with the Simlets. Fish slice noodle soup. The elder Simlet loves noodle soup with air-fried "mini crispy fish" a.k.a anchovies while the younger one totally hates it. Well, one man's meat is another man's poison. But thankfully, I only need minor tweaking for most dishes. Lol. #simletseat #homemadefood #sghomecook #toddlerfood #healthykidsfood #instafood #noodlesoup #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
