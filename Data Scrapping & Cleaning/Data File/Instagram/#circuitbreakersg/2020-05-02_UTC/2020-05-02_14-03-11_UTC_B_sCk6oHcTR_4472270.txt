Day 8: Home based learning
Activity 1: Traffic light man
Activity 2: Indoor obstacle course

There’s no theme today because i decided that the family should burn some calories. 
Both were equally fun and educational. We spice it up with some improvisation with “traffic cars”, added a zebra crossing and more obstacles.
