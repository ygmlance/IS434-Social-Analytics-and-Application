💖Best Black Sesame Pau🥇💖
Saw “Dough Magic” selling steamed buns and cakes at Chinatown previously so I walked closer to check it out their menu and I saw “black sesame bun”! Didn’t have any high expectation but still wanted to give it a try. Glad I did... It is like the best black sesame pau in Singapore! 😍 My previous favourite one was those from Kopitiam because they were not too sweet like the molten ones sold at Fortunate HK dim sum at Food Republic or at Bao Today. But the texture of those from Kopitiam is more grainy like and not as smooth. Was craving for this during the #circuitbreakersg so @mingjiejiee ordered delivery for me. Heehee. 🥰
This one from “Dough Magic” is like the hybrid of both because it has the same molten texture but isn’t too sweet. The filling is like my favourite Chinese black sesame paste dessert. But it is not overpoweringly bitter as well. Perfect balance of flavours! 🙌🏻 And a plus point is the bun is super fluffy also la. Way fluffier than the others I have tried. 💯💯 Do try kopi milo! I really love this combi! 💓 Can taste chocolatey thick milo admist slight bitterness and aroma of kopi c siew dai. 😋
