This Mother's Day, I will get to spend more time with my mum due to Circuit Breaker. She has been working harder especially during this period being the Operational Support in the Healthcare Industry. Seeing how much my mum doing her part battling against this pandemic together with her team, and her commitment serving as a frontliner inspired me. Since I couldn't get her a cake for this Mother's Day, I decided to give her a KFC treat!
.
KFC is running a Facebook contest from 2 May - 8 May where you can stand to win a KFC Mother’s Day Feast worth $63.1 when you share how much you appreciate your mum!! 😍 .
