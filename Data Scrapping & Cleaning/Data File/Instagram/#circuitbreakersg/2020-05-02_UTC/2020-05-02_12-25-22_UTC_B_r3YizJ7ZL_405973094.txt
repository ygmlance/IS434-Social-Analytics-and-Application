Received a very lovely box of goodies today which truly brightens up my day!!! It’s not just any ordinary gift but a lot of thought and dedication has been put into it. Knowing that I choose my food very carefully, the ingredients and calories has been selected to suit the “diva” in me. There is also a nice note that came along with it and to top it all, a photo to remind me that true friendship doesn’t need to meet face-to-face all the time... they just have to be in our thoughts. Thank you to the wonderful chef/baker and I shall eat all of ‘em with my heart’s content! #fitnotfat #bananabread #healthycookies #truefriendship #circuitbreakersg #noneedtocountcalories
