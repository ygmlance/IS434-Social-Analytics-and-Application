@toucanbox finally arrived! 🥰 the first video here is the finished project and her enthusiasm is 💯
.
What we like about @toucanbox is that it isn’t overwhelming, ease of instructions that she can get things done on her own with very minimal aid and supervision
.
For this project, we talked about multiplication and division. The stickers were lined in 2 rows of 4s, or, 4 rows of 2s, and she saw that both 2x4 and 4x2 yields the same results.
.
To cut the very long blue ribbon into 8 equal pieces, we explored division - by folding the ribbon in half to cut, folding in half again to cut, and once more.
.
Our completed project was a fun one! And we raced each other’s (mutated) jellyfish up the ribbon! Quote “su-gb8n” for 50% off your first box!!
