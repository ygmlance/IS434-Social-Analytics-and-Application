#CircuitBreakerSg Day 26 dinner! A non spicy version of hotplate tofu using tau cheo instead of spicy dou ban jiang. Added some egg plant too. A hearty and delicious one pot dish that has egg, minced pork, prawn, egg tofu, mushroom and vegetables. The other dish we had tonight was a special request from my brother. My late grandmaâ€™s salted garlic chicken cooked by my aunt. She marinated the chicken with salt to steam, then cut it up and fried with lots of garlic! We used to eat this so often when we were kids. ðŸ˜‹ Ended the dinner with family favâ€™s chendol that I ordered from Four Season. ðŸ¤ª
