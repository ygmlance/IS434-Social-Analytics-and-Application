L-Sit and V-Sit 💪🏼 Read on to learn more 👇🏼
⁣
The most effective way to train a muscle is to simulate its primary natural function. For the "core", this is stabilising the spine. Other than sitting up from a lying position, our ancestors probably used their core mostly to keep their spines from breaking when carrying heavy loads or casting spears at their prey.
⁣
This means that movement-based core exercises like sit-ups and crunches may be less effective than isometric holds like planks and the L/V-sit. I rarely, if ever, do sit-ups and crunches, but I can knock out 60 sit-ups in as many seconds by occasionally performing isometric core contraction for stability, such as the L/V-sit.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗟-𝘀𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗩-𝘀𝗶𝘁? The V-sit is a more advanced (read challenging) version of the L-sit, so I'll take you through the L-sit first.
⁣
As shown in the first video, you may find starting on an elevation easier, as your legs can hang down below your hands, which decreases the resistance of the exercise. Push down strongly with your arms, depressing your shoulders and locking out your elbows, until you are "sitting" in the air.
⁣
From here, it is all about holding for time. As you grow stronger, you will be able to extend your legs - you can try this one at a time - until you can eventually hold the full "L" position. At the start, just hold as long as you can in the best position you can achieve for 3-5 sets, until you can hit 10-30s holds each time. You will feel it when you're ready to extend your legs further.
⁣
As for the V-sit, take a look at the second video. Two tips for you:
⁣
𝟭. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀.  When pushing up into an L-sit on the floor, do not place your hands next to your hips because you'll end up lifting and extending your hips rather than your legs. ⁣
⁣
𝟮. 𝗚𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮 𝘁𝘂𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. Bring your knees towards your chest. I find it easier to extend into the "V" from this position. Do beware of nasty tricep cramps as your upper body leans back to counterbalance your legs. ⁣

May Day may be over, but the labour never ends. Happy training!
