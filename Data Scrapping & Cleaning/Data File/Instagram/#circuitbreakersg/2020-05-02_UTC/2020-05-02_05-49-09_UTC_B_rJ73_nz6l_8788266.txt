This dish can be done as a main or a side! For me, I chose it as a main as we're trying to eat healthier and lose some pounds too, only thing is I did forget to put the harissa paste/sauce on it and used paprika instead (brillianttttt me!ðŸ¤£) So the video is now renamed to Roasted
Eggplants with minced chicken but Harissa paste is supposedly a great flavour for this dish, try it and let me know how it tastes!! .
