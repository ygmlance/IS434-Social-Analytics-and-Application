Brought the tent out for the kids to play and sleep in. And I love these shots of the boys trying to mimic big sis resting her foot on her head. After some trying, the littlest concluded a success with his foot on big bro’s head!

Apart from the crazy fun, the kids had interesting dreams of fantasies in it. They woke up and chatted non-stop about their dreams. We had to name this tent - The tent of dreams.

Dream big and dream bold. It’s in dreams that we discover the impossibilities. May all the little children in this world be always filled with many amazing dreams, in sleep and in reality.

Good night, world!
