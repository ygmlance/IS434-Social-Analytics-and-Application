Oven-Baked Pastries from @fssingapore for breakfast and my afternoon tea break. Omg, their Croissants are huge, light and airy. Soooooo 👍🏻
.
Four Seasons Hotel Singapore  Coffee2Go Series is available at their Coffee Station located on Lobby Level, opens daily from 8am to 9pm. As all these pastries are fresh baked to order, do place the order by 6pm the day before your preferred collection time.
