Although the Circuit Breaker has affected my income, it also gave me a lot of time for self reflection and learning! 
Hope that all of us can be more prepared for the uncertainty that 2020 is going to bring. 
This is my 3rd book for circuit breaker. English books are definitely easier to read but don't know why, I have a feel to start to read Chinese books. 😁
