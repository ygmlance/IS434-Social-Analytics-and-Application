🍝CB Day26 - Breakfast ☀️
.
鸿记面家 - The famous Wanton Mee at Telok Blangah. Truth, it has always be my go to wanton mee during my years of growing up till now. .
This stall has appeared in many famous food reviews, and of coz I'm proud of having good food around me. It's best to eat it at the stall itself. They roast their own char siew and make their own wanton. They've other famous items on the list like the 水饺&鸡脚. If noodles is not your game, try their kway trow, it is as good! .
ps. You've gotta prepare to queue and please have your orders ready in mind, once auntie ask you, better say it out fast, she don't have the patience to wait for your "errrr...." 🤣🤣🤣
