Hello everyone! Itâ€™s been a while since I posted my dishes. Today I made thisâ€”Brioche with scrambled eggs drizzled with truffle oil and topped with melted cheese, served with oven-baked caramelised tomatoes and oven-baked potato chips, together with salad greens.

Howâ€™s your weekend so far? The first winner of the wine salt giveaway will be announced in a few hours so stay tuned.
