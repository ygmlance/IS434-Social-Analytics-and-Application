Day 26 of Circuit Breaker - Have fun with Rainbow Rice 🌈 Cadence can’t wait to touch those coloured rice, so pretty right? Taught her the colours from book, let her explore with the rainbow rice and have some sensory play with the colourful caterpillar 🐛 Also let her find the caterpillars out from the tray and put back to the apple! Mama also used the blocks to build house for caterpillars.
