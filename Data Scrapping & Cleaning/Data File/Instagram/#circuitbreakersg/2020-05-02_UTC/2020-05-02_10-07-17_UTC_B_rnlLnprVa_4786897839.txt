Day 7 of #CircuitBreakerSG!!!
Woke up at 4am dunno can't get back to sleep so I attempted Mi Jiang Kueh with peanut (1 batch) and coconut fillings (2 batches). By the time I finished, just in time my brother can have it as breakfast before he leaves for work. Then I went back to ðŸ˜´
Not bad my family still leave these 3 pieces for me to try. Rate 6/10 for this. Not a pro so it's nowhere compared to outside. Need to find other recipes or improvise some more. I'm super satisfied with the gula melaka coconut filling I prepared.
