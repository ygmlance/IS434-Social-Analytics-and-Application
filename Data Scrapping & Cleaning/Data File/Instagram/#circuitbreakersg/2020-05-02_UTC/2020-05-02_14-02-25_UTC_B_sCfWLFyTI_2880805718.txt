Garage Project craft brews from @templecellars 🇳🇿🍺

𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝗵! lager is brewed in collaboration with Hawker & Roll, an Asian restaurant serving Malaysia-inspired street food in NZ. You can see how light it is in the photo, but its appearance belies its flavour, which is of subtle, but lively, citrus and tropical fruit notes. As per the official description, this beer is "designed to elevate, not overwhelm". Can Lah! will definitely pair well with Asian street food.

𝗕𝗘𝗘𝗥 pilsner is the embodiment of simplicity in terms of its ingredients - a single malt, a single hop, and a single type of yeast. When I drank BEER, my mind sort of drew a blank at first - it is so simple and elegant, it is as difficult to describe as pure, white, light. ⁣

To me, this is a great brew not because of any easily-identifiable positive characteristics, but because of the complete lack of any discernible negative traits. In my mind, the brewer has achieved sublimity by not trying too hard to do too much, but instead, by making every effort to avoid every possible flaw. The result is a beer that is as simple and beautiful as the package that it comes in. This is a BEER, indeed! ⁣

I've become a big fan of @garageproject brews, from the bold flavours of their IPAs like Pernicious Weed and Bug Powder Dust, to the more understated, but no less impressive, mastery exhibited by their lighter offerings like BEER and Can Lah!. Definitely an outfit that's flying the NZ craft beer flag high! ⁣
