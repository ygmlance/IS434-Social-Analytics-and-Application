Been craving for cafe food and one of the easiest things to make at home is french toast! Dipped the bread in a mixture of eggs, milk, pinch of salt, sugar and cinnamon powder! ⁣⁣

Topped off with some strawberries, blueberries, maple syrup and a sprinkle of icing sugar. ⁣Enjoy with a cup of coffee! ☕
