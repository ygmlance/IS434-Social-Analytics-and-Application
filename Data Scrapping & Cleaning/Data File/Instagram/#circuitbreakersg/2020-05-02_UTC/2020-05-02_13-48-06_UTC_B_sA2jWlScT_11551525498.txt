SHOULDER PRESS PROGRESS! [13TH APRIL (6 reps) ➡️ 1ST MAY (10 reps)]⁣
⁣
I'm just happy with my delts right now as it is the only muscle that's popping in the strength department atm. Everything else is just sad and while I do feel meh about it, I ain't too worried as I know I'll probably get it back once I start strength training consistently again whee. ⁣
⁣
But I'm happy with this mini achievement of mine. Gotta finetune the execution but it's all smiles, and sweat, and tears. Looking to break more records this CB! ⁣

Ps pls ignore my facial expressions - they gtg I know - but the concentration needed to lift this mofo up 10x is real.
