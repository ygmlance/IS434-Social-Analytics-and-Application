2 May 2020 [Part 1/2]: It’s funny how long weekends still feel like them even when we’re stuck at home...
.
Which means brunch together, lots of manly+boyish laughter, movie w snacks & “cheat” meals, since HubbYeo is on a “diet” (1 serving of carb a meal & no overly sinful food like fries etc).
.
Kinda starting to get used to staying home for entire days & enjoy them. Sometimes we don’t have to fill our days with activities & places to go just to make them well-spent - something that both HubbYeo & I tend to do a lot but causes us to be busy for the sake of that & burn out...
