Day 26 of #circuitbreaker: Just as I was running out of meal prep ideas, @ninjakitchensg came through with the BESTTTTT #stayhome gift to power me through the second half of circuitbreaker - their sick CT682 Intellisense Kitchen System!! With 4 attachment appliances and 12 smart programs in this food processor, I got a ton of crazy food prep ideas. Can’t believe Ninja Kitchen products are finally in Singapore!!! 😍✨⁣⁣

But first things first, made myself a good bowl of acai for breakfast hehe. Can I just say that I am thoroughly impressed by its safety features? (1) The base has suction cups to secure the unit onto the countertop, which have smart releases that only activate when you pick the unit up from the bottom, (2) it also has a safety feature that switches the unit off automatically if the lid is not locked tightly 🤩🙌🏼⁣⁣

For someone that never had time for breakfast, breakfast has been an adventure and a real gamechanger with @ninjakitchensg - açai, hummus with pita bread, rösti and cheesecake 🤤 While I go make some delicious dip or maybe cauliflower rice, here’s a 30% off code, in case you’re thinking of getting a CT682 from ninjakitchen.sg: “𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐰𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐠𝐠𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐣𝐚𝐜𝐭𝟔𝟖𝟐” 😉🍓🌮🙊 What should I make, next? Hit me up with some recommendations pls!!
