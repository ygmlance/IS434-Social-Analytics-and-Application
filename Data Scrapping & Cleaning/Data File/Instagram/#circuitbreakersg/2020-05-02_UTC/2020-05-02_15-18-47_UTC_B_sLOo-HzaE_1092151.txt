See what we had for tonight's dinner! Ordered in from our favourite Korean restaurant, @hohochimek. The army stew was on point that we left nothing in the pot. And trust me, you will never regret for ordering their Soy Garlic Korean Fried Wings! Roxanne is having fever today and she has no appetite whole day that she didn't even want her favourite biscuit. We were worried that she may not have sufficient food intake but guess what, Hohochimek's japchae made her eat! She had a bowl of japchae by herself. I was so glad that I included their japchae in the order. Hearsay they going to have a new promo for this extended CB, follow their IG and keep a look out for their super value-for-money promo!
