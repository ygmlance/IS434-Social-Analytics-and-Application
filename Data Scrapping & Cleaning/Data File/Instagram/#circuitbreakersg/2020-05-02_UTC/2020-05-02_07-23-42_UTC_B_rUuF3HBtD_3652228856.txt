Simpleeeeee 30 mins home workout, perfect for beginners, great for regulars. Don't need equipment or much space you can even do it in your room. So no time + no space is not a good excuse ah ðŸ˜‰
.
Work for 40 seconds,
Rest 20 seconds
5 exercises for 5 sets
Rest 1 min between sets.
.
It is time based so do at your own pace, as many reps as you can, don't have to rush. Choose an awesome sound track to get get going ðŸ’ªðŸ’¥ Our aim is to move non stop at a steady pace. You can slow down, but don't stop! Feel the sweat dripping off your face ðŸ˜° Keep going! Tag your friends to be your workout buddy and tag me too if you've tried this and how you feel! ðŸ”¥
