Just after fajr 🌇 and it's still quiet here in our home. Mornings are my favourite hours. Especially when the skies are still dark. I get so much done in those hours.⁣
⁣
Taking a break from the computer and just thinking of loved ones esp my parents and sister and her family. Just thinking of them and the #sunnah of gifting others your prayers/du'aa.⁣
⁣
Although we can't be together with our friends and family now due to the #circuitbreakersg , Alhamdulillah, we can always send them the best gift: our du'aa. 🎁⁣
⁣
And, always be generous with our du'aa as the angels are making the same du'aa for us too 😊⁣
⁣
Do keep us in your du'aa pls ♥
