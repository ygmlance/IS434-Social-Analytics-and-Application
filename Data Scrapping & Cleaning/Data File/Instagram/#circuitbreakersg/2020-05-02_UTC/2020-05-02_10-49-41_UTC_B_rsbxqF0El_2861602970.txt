Wanton noodles for dinner 🍜

All from @eng_kee_noodle_house (You can check Hawkers United - Dabao FB page for more info)

Freshly handmade Wanton and Prawn dumplings. Can be kept for up to 1 month if frozen. You can also order their handmade egg noodles and sauce set to cook your own wanton mee. I like the wanton/dumplings fried! You can airfry it 😋😋 The sauce set consist of - Sambal Chili, Malaysian Dark soy sauce and Pickled green chillies. I prefer HK style wanton noodles or ketchup version.. I find the dark sauce rather bland, need to pair with more chili. Or you can just get the noodles and create your own style/sauce. 
Rather affordable price (min $30 free islandwide delivery) 
33 pc of Wanton $10
10 pc of Prawn dumpling $10
Egg noodle 5 Pc for $5
Sauce set $10
They also have pork ribs, chicken feet and some desserts like Tau Suan, Pulut Hitam and Red/Green bean soup available.
