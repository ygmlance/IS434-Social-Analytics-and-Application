2 May 2020 [Part 2/2]: In the blink of an eye, we’re already halfway through CB & we’ll really miss having HubbYeo at home all the time after this... Can only whine on social media cos he doesn’t like to hear these 🤭
.
I’ll also miss seeing everyone spend time with family on social media & especially fathers playing with kids 😂 Hope we continue to find these aimless leisure times when normal life resumes 👩‍💻
.
Ryan seemingly had a growth & developmental spurt as he suddenly outgrew his clothes & surprised us everyday with the things he say & do. Today, he even wanted to throw out his own poop 💩- by all means dear 😂
.
For now, Ryan still preserves his soft side as he gains independence & manliness with Daddy... & quite often I find myself feeling *smiley w a tiny tear* Is it possible for him to be manly but still behave like a baby towards me forever?
.
Anyhow, for now, life is good. We even sneaked in some couple time for a boliao insta filter, watched 1 episode of a show & played 1 game - 1 each is, in HubbYeo’s books, a balanced weekend 🤓
