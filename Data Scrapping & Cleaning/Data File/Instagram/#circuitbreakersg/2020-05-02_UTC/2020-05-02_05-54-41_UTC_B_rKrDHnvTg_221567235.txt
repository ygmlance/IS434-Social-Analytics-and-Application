The last time I’d had a lengthy phone convo with a friend was probably when I was in my 20’s before social media and lightning-quick, snippety WhatsApp msgs took over. And these days, nothing is more pleasurable than yakking on Zoom for hours on end. Maybe this pandemic will bring back the art of conversation? 🤳🏼🤗 🤞No problems keeping our sanity through #circuitbreakerSG thanks to our entertaining friends! 💕😻💋 #friendsarethefamilyyouchoose #BFFs #loveinthetimeofcovid19
