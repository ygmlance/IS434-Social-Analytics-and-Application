💖Homemade Purple Sweet Potato Soup💖
Instead of pumpkin soup, I made purple sweet potato soup today! 👩🏻‍🍳
I love food but the health conscious part of me always look for healthier alternatives when I cook while retaining the original flavours! 🤗

Previously I used blended raw cashew nuts to thicken my pumpkin soup when I was on keto diet previously. Nuts are high in protein and heart healthy fats. But if are on a strict diet, be careful how much you are eating. Experimented with blended silken tofu today and it worked perfectly. 😍 I totally forgot I didn’t add cream to the soup. It turned out creamy and smooth and if I remembered correctly, it is smoother than when I used cashew nuts previously! 💯 Give this a try and tell me how it goes! 😉 Perfect to dip with bread. I paired mine with homemade smiley pancakes! 😊
