Ban Mian Diaries (home made)

Thanks to circuit breaker, i have had to resort to making my own bowl of ban mian. 
Noodles: beetroot ban mian (available from fair price). Ikan billis: (fried/served separately, copied the idea from joy @ #ylxdelights22 (Yue Lai Xiang Delights). Stock flavour: simmered marinaded minced pork with soy sauce, Sesame oil, chinese wine, white pepper, salt and corn starch. And added ikan billis to the soup. 
VERDICT: a very rare bowl of ban mian that you will not find anywhere else ðŸ¤£
