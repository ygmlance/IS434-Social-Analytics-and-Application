Day 25 of #circuitbreakersg : “Self-Love and Self-Care” kind of day. Staying home can be self admirable too. Love what you do, for me having good oil head and body massage 💆🏻‍♀️ , applying a naturally prepared homemade scrub and face pack, dress-up and most importantly I love having jasmine flowers. Keeps mind calm and happy 😊. Though the situation around us doesn’t accompany our mindset, let’s hope for the better tomorrow 🧚🏻‍♀️.
