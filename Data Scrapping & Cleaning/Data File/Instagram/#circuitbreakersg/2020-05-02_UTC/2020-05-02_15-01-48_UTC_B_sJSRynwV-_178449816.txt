Day 26 of #CircuitBreakerSg
~~~~~~~~~
This was yesterday’s dinner on a cool and rainy evening. Roast lamb with spuds and greens.
.
Weather has been really great the last few days. If it rains heavily, not only is it cooling and comfortable, we won’t think of going out either!
.
Hands up if you feel like April just flew past and where the heck did the time go? In fact I feel like Feb and March have been a grey haze as well. Like a dark patch on the calendar and the only real entry before that was Chinese New Year.
