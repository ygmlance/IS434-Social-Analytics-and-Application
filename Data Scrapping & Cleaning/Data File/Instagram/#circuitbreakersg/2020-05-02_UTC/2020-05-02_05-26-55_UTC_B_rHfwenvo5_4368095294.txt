🥟CB Day26 - Lunch Time🥡
.
Today is my "Meat Monster" duty to buy all 3 meals for us. He went to a coffeeshop among the new blocks at Telok Blangah Street 31. The stall name is 鑫鹏拉面•刀削面 .
Photo 1 is my lunch, too much to finish, ate only half of it that's all.
.
Photo 2 is of coz lunch for the "meat monster" it's so much ingredients... ... The difference is just 50¢ 😱😱😱 I told meat monster, next time just buy 1 portion of what he's eating for me to share with mum.
