Entire hotels have shut down, refugees are being herded into trucks like Jews in Malaysia, and people are losing their jobs but all my mom has to say is how fat I've gotten ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Anyway, whoever guessed things could change so drastically in a few months? I'm supposed to be at an Australian beach right now, but here I am, in front of an empty Fullerton Hotel, wondering when I will see the white-gloved doormen and guests entering and leaving its grand lobby once again. I think we have bigger things to worry about than counting calories at this point. #singapore #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #fullertonhotel  #lockdown #asianmom #mayday
