. 
We ordered a 6-8 pax set from @siamsquaremookata, took us 1.5 hrs to finish. So glad the weather was cool enough and the Mookata was the perfect solution ❤️
.
I love the instant noodles, bbq sausages, bbq pork and the background music playing the 70s Chinese melodies 🤣
What's your ultimate food craving during this circuit breaker? .
