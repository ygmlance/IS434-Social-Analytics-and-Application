😊You are not fully dressed until you put a smile on. 😊hehe... are you “fully dressed” today? Did you remember to smile today? 😊It’s back to Hawker brunch! Don’t be put off by the bloody looking bowl. It’s actually very yummy Chee Cheong Fun (rice noodle roll) in sweet sauce! However, I think the best Chee Cheong Fun belongs to the ones I had when I was still staying in Marsiling Rise. There was a small Chee Cheong Fun manufacturing factory just in front of my house and we used to buy the very freshly made ones from them and drizzle with just light soya sauce and sesame oil. Simple, fresh and very tasty! 😋I also had Min Jiang Kueh (peanut pancake) today! Actually I was contemplating between Min Jiang Kueh and Muah Chee because I kept seeing them on FB! 😅 So I guess I will likely buy Muah Chee tomorrow. Oh and pairing all with floral tea. It’s really pretty as the flower blossomed in hot water. Maybe I should invest in a clear cup soon so I can better admire the tea flowers. Happy Saturday guys!
