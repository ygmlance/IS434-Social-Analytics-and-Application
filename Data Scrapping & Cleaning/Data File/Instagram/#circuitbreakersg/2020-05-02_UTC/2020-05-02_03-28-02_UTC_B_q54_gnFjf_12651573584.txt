Do you have to floss if you use an electric toothbrush?

Regardless of what kind of toothbrush you use and how good your brushing technique is--it canâ€™t replace flossing. 
Even the best toothbrushes clean only the top, front, and back surfaces of the teeth, youâ€™re leaving the side surfaces uncleaned. Having good oral hygiene habit is very important especially during Circuit Breaker period. Stay safe and stay healthy!
