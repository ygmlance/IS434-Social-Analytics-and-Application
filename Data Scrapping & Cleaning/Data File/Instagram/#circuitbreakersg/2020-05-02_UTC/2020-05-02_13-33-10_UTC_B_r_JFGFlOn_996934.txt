#circuitbreakerday26 // Grateful for these simple pleasures of #locksport x @theboywhobakes’ more-ish #chocolatecrinklecookies (our little toaster oven only makes 5 at a time) x  @bradyscoffeeireland (filter-ground but superbly smooth and sweetly robust when forced through a #mokapot - thank you @flagflownhigh!)

Good work-through of #ecclesiastes5 a few nights ago. If the entire chapter has to do with ambition and greed, then the #Qohelet shows us its lies.
.
Ambition and greed are not the sort of thing most young Christians think they will be tempted by when they start work - meh, it’s the preserve of balding uncles and tiger moms.
.
But a mere 10-15 years later, a mere blink of an eye after that first job and early marriage, the person in the mirror is middle-aged, perhaps balding and/or a tigermom/dad; the eyes are bloodshot and jaundiced from too many late nights and an unhealthy lifestyle, the phone is constantly buzzing with family commitments and school grapevine gossip about successful (or notorious) ex-classmates and how much they are enjoying life and how great their kids are doing.
.
Q: Do you then send a quick prayer to God promising that if He gets you that senior position (with a load more moolah), you will use your new influence (and money) to proclaim His gospel? .
.
Q: Do you, whilst in middle management, overwork your subordinates or oppress others, because that’s how you survive in the company, and anyway, that’s why all the lower tier staff still have jobs?
.
.
Q: Do you work to hit that next paygrade, because then there will be less friction at home because you can get one more maid, enjoy better food, bring the kids for ski holidays twice a year, and so you’ll finally be happy?
.
.
Q: Do you do this, not for selfish reasons, but so that your kids will have a college fund and downpayment for a new home?
.
.
All vanity, says Ecclesiastes 5.
