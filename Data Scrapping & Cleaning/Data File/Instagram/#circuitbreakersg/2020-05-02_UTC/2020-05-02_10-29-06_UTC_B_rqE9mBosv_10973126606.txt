Who is ready for some chicken rice in the comfort of your home?

I craved for chicken rice and ngoi hiang and so ordered @sinnjithomsonroad the following yummies!
.
🥢 Half Chicken Mix (Poached and Roasted Chicken)
🥢 Homemade 5 Spiced Chicken Roll (Ngoi Hiang)
🥢 Fu Rong Egg
🥢 Braised Eggs (Add on)
🥢 Chicken Rice (Add on)

I am more of a roast chicken person but I must say their poached chicken was really moist, tender and so slippery that put my chopstick skills on test! Their fu rong egg had a lot of juicy prawns inside. My personal favourite was their 5-Spiced Chicken Roll. Usually this would have been filled with pork. Chicken Roll tasted just as awesome and yummilicious! Total cost was $36.2 with free contactless delivery!
