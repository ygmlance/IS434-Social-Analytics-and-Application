We had a mini birthday celebration at home today, for my son's 13th birthday. He requested for Oreo Cheesecake & pizza + game time lah what else. So I ordered pizza for the fam and made myself a #LowCarb #Seafood #Pizza it was surprisingly good even my daughter said delicious but suggested that I bake it a little longer next time. I made a no bake Oreo Cheesecake for him but his version lol. Yeah! My mission completed bcoz they gave me ‚úÖ. What's next? Prolly rest for a while before I change to bartender üòÇ. ‚Å£
