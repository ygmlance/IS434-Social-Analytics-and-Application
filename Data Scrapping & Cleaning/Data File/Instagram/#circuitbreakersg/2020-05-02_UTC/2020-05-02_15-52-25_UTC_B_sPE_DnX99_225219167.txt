Nutella Star Bread.
Since the cinnamon bread dough turned out so well, decided to use the same dough recipe but fill it with Nutella instead. Wanted to either braid it or do a pull apart bread just for fun. Went with this star-shaped braid cos although it’s fancy-looking, it’s actually really simple to do! Nat helped with measuring out some ingredients and spreading the Nutella. Ollie just repeatedly sniffed and said, “smells nice”😆 Baking is such a great activity for kids cos it’s really both an art and a science. Definitely gonna bake more when Ollie is a little older and can join in. For now, it’s only when Papa is free to watch her😄. Final product is less fluffy as compared to the cinnamon roll though, prob cos chocolate affects the rise a bit and also bake time could be reduced slightly since the layers are thinner as compared to the cinnamon rolls. Will be better next time round! #bakingonacloud #nutellastarbread #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #bakingwithkids
