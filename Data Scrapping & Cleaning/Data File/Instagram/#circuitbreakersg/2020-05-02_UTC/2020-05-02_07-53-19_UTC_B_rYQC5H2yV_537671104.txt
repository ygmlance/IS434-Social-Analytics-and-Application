#CircuitBreakerSG Day 26:  I’m staying home & spending precious time bonding with my son. If you’re cooking, get your kid to be your Sous Chef! It’s a good time to play masak masak with your kids while being stuck at home. 💕

#StayHomeForSG ~ We had Tom Yum Seafood Pasta for our threesome dinner & I also made Crispy Prawns Toasts. Youngsters love fried food, so I roped in my son & made him my Sous Chef! After I’d prep all the ingredients, I got Jon to slice the bread, spread the prawn paste & even cook them!

Ingredients:
.
📍6 Slices of White Bread
📍16 Medium Prawns
📍2 Sprigs of Parsley (chopped)
📍3 tbsp Mayonnaise 📍3 tbsp Sesame Seeds
📍1 tsp Corn Flour to bind the mixture
📍Pepper & Salt to taste
📍Cooking oil if frying the toasts

Method: .
1️⃣ Cut off the sides from the bread, & slice into halves.  Set aside. .
2️⃣ Prepare the prawns & then chop them up. I like to mince my prawns using a chopper instead of a blender for more texture. If you're not fussy on the taste, you can also choose to buy ready-made paste available in supermarkets. .
3️⃣ Combine paste with chopped parsley, mayo, corn flour & seasonings. .
4️⃣ Spread the paste on the bread & top with sesame seeds.  Using the butter knife, gently press the paste down to prevent it from dropping off if you’re frying them. .
5️⃣ 3 ways of cooking the Prawn Toasts: .
✅ Most delicious with nice colour, but a bit oily: Heat oil & place bread prawn side down. Fry for about 3 mins, then turn over. Toast is ready when prawns turned pink. *Your fire can’t be too high or you’ll burn the toasts. .
✅ Healthiest, but very dry: Air fry on 180 deg for 6 mins, then 200 deg for 2 mins or till golden brown. .
✅ Healthy & less dry, but colour not as nice: Preheat oven at 180°C, then grill for about 5 mins depending on your oven type, or till golden brown.
