Things to do with the kids #42

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "I'm not coming #downstairs, and you're not coming #upstairs?" "No Titus, you are not white, like me, aka #Gandalf. You're a sort of shitty brown colour and Mum said you stank like a sewer last night." "Vanilla, I was defending our turf. I noticed you just sat there and watched." "I may be fluffy, but I'm not stupid." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
