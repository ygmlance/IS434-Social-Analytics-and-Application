Friends who bring you food during the "circuit breaker" are just the best!  Thanks, @pangszewei!  Yummy butter cake delivered to our door late in the evening of day 26 and of course I had to eat it with lashings of butter.  Butter on warm cake just out of the oven with a mug of hot cocoa and cream is just awesome! üßà‚ù§Ô∏è
