Day 26.

Today I was in front of the laptop for many hours trying to pass a test.

Iâ€™m thankful that I have Mr Liâ€™s laptop to use during this CB period.

Truth is I donâ€™t own one and I donâ€™t see the need to have one when he has one ðŸ¤“

When I was in corporate, I try not to work on a laptop after work as staring at one for 5 full days is enough.

But moving forward, perhaps itâ€™s soon to shop for one... What are you grateful for today?
