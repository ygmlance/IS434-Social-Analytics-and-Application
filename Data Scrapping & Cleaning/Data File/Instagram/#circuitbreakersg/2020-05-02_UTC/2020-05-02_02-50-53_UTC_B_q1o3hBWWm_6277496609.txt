Ants Nest Cake 😂 
Doesn’t sound that appetising in English does it? This is what Malays call “Kek Sarang Semut”. It’s basically caramelised sugar cake. I don’t use a lot of sugar in this recipe because #kitadahcukupmanis 🤣 I used the rice cooker to make this. Seems like rice cooker cakes are the rage this circuit breaker season. Here’s one recipe for you to try. .
In a pan, heat 2/3 cup sugar until it melts and turn brownish. Stir with a whisk to prevent it from burning. When you start smelling faint burnt smell, add 1 cup hot water (add bit by bit and gently as it’ll sizzle) and continue stirring until all the sugar has mixed well. After that add half a block of butter (about 125g) and let it mix. Put aside
.
In a bowl, mix 4 eggs with half a can of condensed milk. Then add 1 cup of flour and 1 tbsp baking soda. Mix well. After that, add that pan of burnt sugar mixture into this bowl and mix well. .
Pour into the rice cooker (greased with butter) and start it up. When it’s done, poke with a skewer. If it comes out clean it’s done. Otherwise hit ‘cook’ one more time
