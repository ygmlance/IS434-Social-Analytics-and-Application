“Echo” is supposedly a new Singaporean character from Overwatch, and was released earlier this April. Overwatch is a GREAT game and Echo’s a really cool character… BUT let’s just say we weren’t too satisfied with the intonation and interpretation of specific #singlish vocabulary. SO we decided to take a stab at it during this #circuitbreakersg period!

Let us know what you think of our version, and hang around a little later in the video for a special guest appearance 🤩
 Many thanks to Su Ling Chan (@cupcakearmbar) for lending her fantastic voice (all remotely of course) to this fun project. Su Ling plays “Mayday” in No Straight Roads by Metronomik, an awesome PC/Console title we’ve been working on that will be releasing in the coming months, so keep a look out for that!

If you like what you see and hear, share it out so this video can be over-watched 🤪
