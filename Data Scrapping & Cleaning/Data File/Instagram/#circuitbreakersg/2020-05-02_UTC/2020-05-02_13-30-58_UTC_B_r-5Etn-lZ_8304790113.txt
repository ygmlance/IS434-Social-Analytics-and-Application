This easy shape activity using playdough is  super simple to set up and we can actually use any thing we already have on hand! Here, we are using the shape cutters that consist of all the basic shapes. Besides doing puzzles and reading books about shapes, this activity allows Baby A to be hands on in learning shapes. .
