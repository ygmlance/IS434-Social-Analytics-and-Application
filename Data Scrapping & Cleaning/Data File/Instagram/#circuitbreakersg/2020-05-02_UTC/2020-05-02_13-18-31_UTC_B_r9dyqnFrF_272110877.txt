Day 25. A good sign as indicated by the sky this morning. Positive news about easing certain aspects of circuit breaker! But we have to stay safe to bring down the local cases to a '0'. Lunch - baked cauliflower with paprika powder, bacon-wrapped asparagus, multigrain rice. Dinner - Mr. and Missy wanted burgers. I cooked some noodles, with my fav combi - chilli oil, vinegar and coriander. Satisfying meal with a gorgeous view. 真的柳暗花明又一村! #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #spendingtimewithfamily #realfood #homecookedmeal #instadaily
