Hi everyone!!!! Sharing our May @thehighpanterssg Challenge!

Plan your running routes as HEARTS! We aim to collate and collage all the HEARTS and fill up our Singapore map!

Collective target: 300 HEARTS!

Tips: Use mapometer (https://www.mapometer.com) to plan your route if needed!

And the adidas Running app for this challenge!

Simply share your run route with us! You may also post on your IG. Do remember to tag @thehighpanterssg and use our hashtag #THP❤️ when you share your progress! 
Inspire and be inspired.

Spreading love and good vibes only xoxo.
