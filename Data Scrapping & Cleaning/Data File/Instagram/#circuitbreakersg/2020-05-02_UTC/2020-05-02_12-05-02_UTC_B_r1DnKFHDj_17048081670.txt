Yesterday, I painted my chair a new colour and decorated the study room.
Today, I spent some time painting myself with my make-up kit (they may have thought Ive forgotten them) and ‘decorated’ myself with my fav. colour sunglasses. Getting myself to be ready for fresh air, gentle sunlight and greenery when #covid19 #circuitbreaker is over!!! 🙏🤪🥰
