Saw many posts on Lotus Leaf #Buns 荷葉包 recently.

My family likes having the steamed buns with caramelized #Onion with #PorkBelly & #Cabbage. You can replace Pork Belly with Bacon. The Sugar Loaf Cabbage gives additional sweetness & crunch to it. Another way to up the vegetable intake too.

Happy weekend 🌻
