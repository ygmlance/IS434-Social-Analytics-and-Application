Staying fit during the #SGCircuitBreaker has been one of my top priorities. 🦍 For some reason, I've found myself to become much more active and concerned about my physical health than before the Circuit Breaker?! Do you feel that way too?⁣ 🙈
⁣
Here are some workouts I've been doing:⁣
🏃‍♀️Lots of neighbourhood jogs⁣
🎽Intensive stretching to work on my side splits and perfecting my front split⁣
🤸‍♀️Core abs ⁣
🍗 Legs conditioning because I've got chicken legs⁣
⁣
Notice I missed out #JellyArms? 🍮
