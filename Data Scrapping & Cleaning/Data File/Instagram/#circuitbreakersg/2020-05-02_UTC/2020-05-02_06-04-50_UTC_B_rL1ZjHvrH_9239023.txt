I think it's important to provide kindy kids with opinion-based activities. Things like 'Do you prefer donuts or cupcakes?', 'What's your favourite fruit?', or 'Why do you not like pears?'.

Questions like these help in their cognitive development as they think and understand more about themselves and the world around them. Once they've got a mental picture, they can verbalise it and finally, learn to write it!
