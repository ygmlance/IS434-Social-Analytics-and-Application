Easties, we hear you!
(Westies and Northerners, we haven’t heard from you yet). * Your fridge is stuffed.
* You sip, not glug.
* You’re a teetotaler (except on days of the week starting with S). How are you supposed to meet the minimum order – especially when everything you want is on *sale*? Next week, we’ll try an experiment.

DM us with your postal code and potential wine order by Monday 4 May.

We’ll map out our deliveries and consolidate orders. The more orders we receive from your neighborhood, the lower the minimum for free delivery.
