[ 02.05.2020 ] Hello! How is everyone doing? I hope you’re all doing fine, Alhamdulillah. Its been a while since I last “see” you guys, here!

Times have been rushed & hectic! We’re into day 26 of Circuit Breaker (aka Quarantine) in Singapore. Who knew that a month ago, we were out & about our daily lives as per normal.

I pray that everyone is well, safe, and healthy in this trying times of Covid-19. May we all come out of this stronger and with more resilience 💪🏻 Don’t forget to:
👭🏻 Check up on loved ones
🍎 Eat healthy
🏃🏻‍♀️ Keep fit

Take care, everyone! 🌻
