So during this #circuitbreaker period, I challenge myself to do a 30min workout daily for 6 days (cos I needed to rest on day 7 😂😂).
Starting is really hard especially amidst working from home, zoom meetings, running my mom to the clinic for blood tests (unfortunately she came down with #denguefever) n insane cooking for hungry LOMLs.
However once I start into a workout... no regrets at all... I particularly feel energised n motivated by @mrandmrsmuscle YouTube videos n can complete at least 2 vids in one go (yeah I m kinda out of shape).
Other YouTube vids n IG vids that motivates me are
@blogilates
@yoga.burn
@lovesweatfitness
I be joining @Blogilates May Challenge! Hoping to post before and after pics of my body this time... who's joining me?! 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️💪💪💪
