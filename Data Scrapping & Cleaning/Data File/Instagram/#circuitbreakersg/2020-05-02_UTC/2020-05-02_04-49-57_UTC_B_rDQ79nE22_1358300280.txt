May - It’s the start of the 5th month of the year! Catch Melanie next week on your screens as she guides you virtually in your practice. She will be teaching Basic Yoga, Stay Home Hot Classic & Hatha Yoga - all of which are great for beginners. (And even for those who practice regularly, coming back to basics is something that we should consciously keep in mind as well 😊)
.
Something for you to work on perhaps this #stayhome period?
.
👉  Book your mats online MINDBODY / Classpass. We offer Virtual packages of 5 for $40 or single session at $10. Payment via Paynow / GrabPay. Schedule and mat booking in profile. 👈
.
Wishing all a lovely weekend, hang tough & see you on your mats 💪
