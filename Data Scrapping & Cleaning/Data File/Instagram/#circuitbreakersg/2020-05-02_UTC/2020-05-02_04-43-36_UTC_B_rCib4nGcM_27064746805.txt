After a long time, I decided to open a bottle of sake. I'm a huge fan of sake, given a choice I can pair it with any cuisine or mood. Like I did last night, with a modern Indian meal! The one we opened is a really special sake. It is aged in oak and would look like a bottle of white wine, except it isn't!

Colour🌈: Champagne gold, clear
Nose👃: Stone fruit, peach, almond, vanilla, quince, honey
Palate👅: Dry, almond, cooked rice, honey medium plus to full body, medium acidity, medium plus finish. 
My Thoughts ®️: If French Chardonnay and Sake had an affair, Hanagaki would be their love child. This sake amalgamates the essence of sake in the form of the rice on the palate but the finish and the nose are of Chassagne Montrachet. Which is why a Burgundy glass is ideal for serving this sake.They make only 900 something bottles every year so not easy to find. Esora in Singapore has it on their menu. This is so dignified and classy that serve it just by itself like wine or pair it with food. You have a winner at your hand!

Stay healthy stay safe 💚♥️ #sakeofinstagram #winesingapore #sommeliersg #wineofinstagram
