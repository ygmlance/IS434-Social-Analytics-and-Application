Yay.... Singapore is easing up on the CB measures. We can go out soon - I need to shop. What about you?

Thank you teacher Momo for teaching us this song and the sign languages. @momomomomo_official @asher_mendelsohn @l_am_mialiow @alyssa_lam_sl @gisele_chiam_gigi @tiabo_j @kayla.grace.jh @keane_yap @nixole._.nxg_ #circuitbreakersg #showwecaresg #sgunited #ktsloveisintheair
