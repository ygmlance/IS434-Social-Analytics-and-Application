Going Mediterranean with these Turkish shish kofta kebabs served with raisin rice pilaf, grilled pear & endive salad, and orange yogurt dressing. We loved the medley of flavours from the ground beef and lamb, onion, parsley, coriander, pepper, cumin, paprika & cinnamon (no salt). I was indeed pleased that Isaac took to the spices and lamb. He happily gobbled down his two small portions of meat and then proceeded to eat more off my skewer. It looks like my first attempt at homemade kofta kebabs will definitely not be the last.
