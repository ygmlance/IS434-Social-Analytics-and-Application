Saturday afternoon tea, was my last remaining couple of Yi Bua, bought from @kuehs_and_snacks last week before they closed for covid-19. These are Hainanese kueh with a glutinous rice skin, and a grated coconut, ginger and palm sugar filling. I pan-fried them instead of steaming them up. They were tasty, and nicely textural, with a crisp crust, and soft, chewy skin. Delicious! Has anyone ever done this before? ðŸ˜‹ #yibua #hainaneseyibua #hainanesekueh #slowfoodheritagehero #kuehsandsnacks #sgfood #sgfoodculture #sghawkerfood #sghawkerculture #ourhawkerculture #tapao #supportlocalsg #savefnbsg #stayathome #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg #afternoontea
