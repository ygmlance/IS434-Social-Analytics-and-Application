This low-rise condo is located within the springleaf enclave of Upper Thomson Road. A well renowned lower density hotspot for those seeking a more secluded abode. Surrounded by the Seletar Reservoirs Nature Reserves, The Essence gives you the opportunity to get back to the essentials. Other than the beautiful parks and nature reserves, the surrounding landscape has a few landed buildings and minimal low-rise housing to further enrich the calming serenity.

Complementary to the exquisite design of the building and high-quality finishes, The Essence will boast great natural lighting and airflow, utilizing the natural green landscape to its advantage. Within the immediate vicinity of The Essence, residents will find a folly of local food outlets and eateries within a very short walk.
