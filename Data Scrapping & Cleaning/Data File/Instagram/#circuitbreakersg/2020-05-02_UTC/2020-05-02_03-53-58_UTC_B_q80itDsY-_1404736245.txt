When we came face-to-face with the plant best describing the current times: #TouchMeNot ðŸ˜…ðŸ’š. As we set off for our morning walk today, breathless with faces half covered, the fading magic of our little excursion was instantly restored by a bunch of perky green touch-me-nots. Not touching the touch-me-nots is a big disservice to them, and to oneself. When I was a kid, the feeling it gave me, came close only to spotting the elusive #firefly on a pitch-dark night. So, we dutifully went through the gleeful process, and nothing made Shivin happier the whole way. We had about 3 such other breaks while walking, which mostly entailed some form of complaining (all muffled thanks to the mask), so this one definitely stood out for me too ðŸ’š! #smalljoys #mimosapudica #nature #naturewalk #greenery #grass #wildflowers #wildplants #walk #morningwalk #lockdown #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #mask #urbannaturewalk #ShivInDaHouse
