It’s finally the school holidays but I missed my school, friends and teachers! How about you? I never thought I’d say this, it may sounds weird that I do not look forward to the school holidays but instead hope to be back to school. Counting down to the 2nd June! #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeforSG #SGUnited #ImStayingHome
