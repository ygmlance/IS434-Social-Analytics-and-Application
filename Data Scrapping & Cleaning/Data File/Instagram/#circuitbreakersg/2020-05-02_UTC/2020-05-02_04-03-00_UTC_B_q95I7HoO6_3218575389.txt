Major creative block this week. I decided to try out last weekâ€™s speed lettering challenge by @stefankunz and @homsweethom. If u think u canâ€™t letter, check out my 1min and 10min sketches ðŸ˜‚. Lettering faster is definitely something I want to work on especially now with schools closed.
The completed piece took about 1 hour but choosing the right colour palette took all week, that was really frustrating and demoralising, so @iamgiagraham â€˜s @skillshare class on choosing the right colour palette was soooo helpful!!
The dampened mood mightâ€™ve been associated with a very wet week in Singapore, and that has also amplified this season of waiting.
Waiting for Circuit Breaker to end, waiting for my seedlings to grow, for GrabFood to arrive, waiting to be able to work on my business again, waiting for some me-time, for the kid to be willing to eat/shower/sleep, waiting for more babies ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.
Waiting is haaard. But waiting for nothing is hopeless. I am glad to be waiting on a God who hears and answers, who does not let me wait in vain.
As I waited for the creative block to lift, I learnt to see that just as rainy days are refreshing and beautiful, HOW I wait makes all the difference.
Hope this piece encourages you to wait patiently and in worship for Him.
