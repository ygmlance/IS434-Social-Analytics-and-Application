A simple ( but lots of work) and comforting Chinese dinner on a rainy night. We had plain rice congee paired with side dishes: fried luncheon meat, picked radish with pork slices, bamboo shoot stew, bok choy (greenest vegetable you can find there), meigan cai with pork belly and spicy fried shrimp sambal ( “hei bi hiam”, the orangey-red portion in the middle). #sgfood #circuitbreakersg
