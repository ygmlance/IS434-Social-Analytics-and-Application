Sinus congestion is uncomfortable because it make you difficult to breathe or sleep. Essential oils may help open the airway and ease congestion. To use them, it is best to inhale the scent by:
1/ Stream inhalation: adding few drops of oil to a bowl of boiling water and inhale the steam for about 2 minutes. Keep eyes closed to prevent eye irritation. 
2/ Direct inhaling from the oil bottle or place a few drops to a tissue and gently breathe in. 
3/ Use a diffuser to disperse oil into the air. 
4/ Add a few drops to bathwater and gently inhale while soaking. 
Try it out. Cheers !ðŸ˜€
