Dinner this evening, was of a dish of Stir-fried Leeks with Prawns and a dish of Steamed Eggs, which was flavoured with minced pork, superior light soya sauce, fish sauce, fried minced garlic and lard oil. It was steamed together with the rice, and was garnished with fried shallots and chopped spring onions. A tasty and satisfying nostalgic taste memory. ðŸ˜‹ #stirfriedleekwithshrimp #steamedegg #teochewfood #teochewcuisine #stayathome #eatathome #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #tasteofnostalgia #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
