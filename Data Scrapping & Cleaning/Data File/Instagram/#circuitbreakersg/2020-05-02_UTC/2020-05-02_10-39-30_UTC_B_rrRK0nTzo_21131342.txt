In a week’s time, it will be Mother’s Day and this year while we have to stay home to celebrate this special occasion, we’ve got the opportunity to spend more time with our little ones who made us Mothers. .
.
After becoming a mother, I learnt to appreciate the personal struggle and strong will of my power Mama who has raised three children with an amazing career. As a mother and a career woman, my Mama taught me to embrace challenges and our shortcomings while learning to become a better mom.
