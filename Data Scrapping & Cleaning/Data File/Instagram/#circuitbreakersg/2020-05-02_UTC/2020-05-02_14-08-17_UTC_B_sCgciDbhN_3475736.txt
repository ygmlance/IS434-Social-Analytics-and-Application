Day 26 of circuit breaker, Leodys played carrot sorting toy. He was so excited when I showed him this toy and canâ€™t wait to play it. Tried showing him a few times on how to play. He still will not get all correct, at least he will try his best to correct it if I said it is wrong. Pardon his bolster hugging moment, he needed some motivation to continue. This toy is good to improve his eye and hand coordination. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #hbl #homebasedlearning #homebasedactivities #sortingtoy #bolsterlover #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #hshsatz
