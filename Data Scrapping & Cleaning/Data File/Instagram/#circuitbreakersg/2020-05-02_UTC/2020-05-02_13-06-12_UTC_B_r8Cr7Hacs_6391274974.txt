Hi Good Folks,
.
Some of you have already met him while out delivering your TGB meals — say hi to our one and only Delivery Boss Man, @tyroneboon!
.
He’s working hard all-day, everyday to plan & deliver your meals, islandwide. Not forgetting our TGB Cafe Crew who’s also been prepping your delicious TGB favourites, day in and out👏🏻.
.
If you haven’t heard, we’re doing our own ISLANDWIDE DELIVERY! Help #savefnbsg by ordering directly from us (link in bio) to minimise the high third-party platform fees!
.
Here’s our delivery rates as follows:
👍🏻 $5 flat ISLANDWIDE with a min. order of $20
👍🏻 $3 flat ISLANDWIDE for orders above $30
👍🏻 FREE DELIVERY ISLANDWIDE for orders above $50
.
We highly recommend to make delivery orders at least ONE DAY in advance. This will help us better plan, prep & ensure the quality of food when it reaches you!
.
We thank you all who’ve been supporting us through this period, we will make it through together❤️ Stay safe & take care everyone!
