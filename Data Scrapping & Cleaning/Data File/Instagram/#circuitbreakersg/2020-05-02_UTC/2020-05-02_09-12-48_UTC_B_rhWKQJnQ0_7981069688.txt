Stan Getz & Chet Baker - Stan Meets Chet,1958. You’d expect these two West Coast boys to have had many more recordings together. Their styles are a good match but rumour has it they didn’t like each other too much. Both reached a juncture in their careers when this record was made. Getz headed off to Europe soon after and Chet had a good run with Riverside. Stan Meets Chet isn’t too much of a duet, you don’t hear them playing together as much as you’d expect. Enough curiosity and star material to float this record on a rainy afternoon  #stangetz #chetbaker #stanmeetschet #jodiechristian #victorsproles #marshallthompson #ververecords
