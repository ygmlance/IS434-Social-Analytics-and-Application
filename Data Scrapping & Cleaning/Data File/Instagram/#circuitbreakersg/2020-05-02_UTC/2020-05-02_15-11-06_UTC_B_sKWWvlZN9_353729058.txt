This year’s wedding anniversary is somewhat special, it is within the “Circuit Breaker”, an elevated set of safe distancing measures implemented by the SG government in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. A moment that will be capture in history textbooks many years later

Today we celebrate our 4 years of marriage at the comfort of our home and as a family of four for the first time! Thank God for His providence and keeping everyone of us safe and healthy during this period. Thank you mummy @annlace for all the sacrifices you made for the family and for giving birth to our 2nd born, Alphaeus! May our love for each other deepens as we grow old together
