Let's eat while it's piping hot, it's fish & chips for dinner tonight. 2 hours of prep time later, we're finally ready to dig in. 
Everything was done by me from scratch including the tartar sauce. Pro-tip: use yogurt as a substitute and mix in lemon juice and some spices for a healthier alternative. 
Cheers to the weekend. .
