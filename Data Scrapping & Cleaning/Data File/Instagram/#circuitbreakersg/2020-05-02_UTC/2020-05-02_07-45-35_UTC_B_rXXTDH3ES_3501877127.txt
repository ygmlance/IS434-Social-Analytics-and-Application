⁠
The current COVID-19 pandemic has placed the spotlight on one of Singapore’s most frequently overlooked communities: our migrant workers. Far from home, fearful of infection risks and uncertain of the future, our migrant worker community needs our help more than ever. ⁠
⁠
If you'd like to make a positive difference to the lives of those who have toiled diligently and thanklessly to build our nation, here's your chance to help - AND receive answers to your own questions in these chaotic times!⁠
⁠
I'm holding a charity fundraiser on FACEBOOK LIVE for Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), a charity organisation in Singapore that defends the rights and welfare of our migrant worker community. I'll be offering CHEAP one-question quickie Tarot readings at only $21+, to be answered during the Facebook Live event. All proceeds go to TWC2. Click on link to purchase your tickets now! ⁠
⁠
These are tough times. You need answers. The migrant workers need help. Make yourself free on Tuesday, 12 May 2020, from 8-10 pm Singapore time (GMT +8), get your tickets NOW and meet me on Facebook Live!
