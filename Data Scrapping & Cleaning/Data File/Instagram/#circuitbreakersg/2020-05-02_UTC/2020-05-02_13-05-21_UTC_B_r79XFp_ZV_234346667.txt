【Recipe】Made Hakka Mee and pork meatballs Bak Choi soup for dinner. Simple weekend eats so I can have some time to bake😂 #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
Though I’ve cooked Hakka Mee several times (even blogged about it), I’ve usually used shallot oil instead of pork lard to coat the noodles🤔 Finally made the bold change today! Do away with shallot oil and used pork lard this time. 
I wouldn’t say it’s way better then the previous version, but the lard definitely gave it much more depth in flavour. That extra oomph! #honeybeecookshakkamee

Catch me cooking this simple but delicious lardy noodles in my IGS. And you can change to shallot oil, and use chicken mince if you’re not a fan of pork😁 #honeybeeweekendmeals —————————-
250g minced pork
100g Pork fat
4 shiitake mushrooms, soaked & sliced
(Reserve mushrooms soaking liquid) 
4 servings of fresh egg noodles,
2 tbsp minced garlic 
Marinade
1 tbsp ginger purée
1 tbsp garlic purée
1 tbsp corn flour 
1 tsp soy sauce 
1 tsp white ground pepper 
2-3 tbsp stock or water

Seasoning
1 tbsp fish sauce 
1 tsp sugar 
Spring onion and crispy pork lard for garnish

Method 
1) Pan fry the pork fat at Low heat till oil is all rendered out and left with not brown crispy bits. Low heat is the key to not burning and yielding crunchier texture.
2) Marinate the mince pork with the marinade ingredients and let sit for 20 mins. 
3) Wok over medium Low heat with 2 tbsp of pork lard oil. Add minced garlic and mushrooms, sauté till aromatic. 
4) Add in minced pork and sauté as you gradually break up the meat. 
5) Add all of the seasonings and toss well. Add in mushroom soaking liquid. Simmer for 3-4 mins till pork is cooked. 
6) Blanched noodles and rinsed with cold water. Toss with 1 tbsp of pork lard oil for each serving. Top with minced pork mushrooms and sprinkle with garnish. Serve immediately and enjoy.
