Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 26:
We had bananas that were ripening very quickly so I decided to bake it before it goes bad.

Since I haven't made banana bread before, I wasn't sure what type of recipe to look for to get the fluffy kind of banana bread as I'm not a fan of heavy and dense bread. Decided to go with my favorite blogger's @justonecookbook banana bread recipe to try it out.

The wonderful aroma of baked bananas smelt amazing in the kitchen! Couldn't wait to have a bite so I quickly cut a small piece to try. YUMMMMMM!

Was so surprised and delighted to find that this recipe turned out to be exactly what I was looking for!

This is gonna be a new favourite!
