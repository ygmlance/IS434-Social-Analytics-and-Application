Had a grilled crab craving. @burntends_sg to the rescue!  King crab legs in garlic and brown butter, beef tenderloin, burnt onion purée, bone marrow sauce, fennel and burrata, and Jamaican chicken wings. Required a bit of reheating, but just as good as at the restaurant, without the hassle of getting a reservation!
