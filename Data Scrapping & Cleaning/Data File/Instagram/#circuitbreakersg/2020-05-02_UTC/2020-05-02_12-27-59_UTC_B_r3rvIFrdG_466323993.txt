Risotto made from scratch - no instant seasoning or canned soup (only milk and butter). The ingredients were separately seasoned and cooked, then recooked in the pressure cooker after mixing well. The whole dish was only seasoned by salt and pepper, with a little mirin when stir-frying the vegetables to prep. The result was delicious (approved by the husband who is a very picky eater)! ✌️ #foodstagram #risotto #singaporecook #italianfood #homecookedfood #lowfathighcalciummilk #circuitbreakersg #sgunited #sgfood
