In 2007, I bought this Acer monitor at COMEX for $299.

Through its screen I did my FYP, cheonged (or copied) multiple tutorials & assignments, updated countless MSN statuses, watched shows from Avatar to House MD to 金庸 dramas to dumb meme videos, created and practiced through countless PowerPoint presentations etc etc etc.

And all these while surviving through my past 3 laptops (Fujitsu, MacBook Pro & current MacBook). Alas 13 years later, WFH finally took its toll and it decided to act up in the past week.

Thankfully it was able to survive until the new monitor arrived today.

Here it is, showing it’s familiar startup logo for the final time.

Thank you buddy for being with me through many milestones, ups and downs 🙏🏻. Rest in Piece.
