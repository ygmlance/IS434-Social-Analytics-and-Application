#Repost I love a fun aerobics workout that doesn't make you feel like you're working out. Since @AMANDACHAANG has passed me the baton to the AIA #EmbracingNewNorms Challenge, here's a quick little aerobics routine for all you cool cats and kittens inspired by the circuit breaker life.

If you're up for the challenge, go ahead and take a picture or a video of a fun, creative way to get your sweat on using anything (or nothing) you can find at home, upload it onto your socials, tag @aiasingapore and include the hashtags #EmbracingNewNorms and #AIASG!

The top 10 most creative entries win $50 worth of shopping vouchers! That's 50 actual dollars you could use to buy things I mean y'all should get on it. Contest ends at 23:59 on the 10th of May so go on start getting creative with your workouts! (and no, eating is not a workout. I've already asked them.) Check out the full contest details right here: bit.ly/AIAEmbracingNewNorms

@DavidBeckham started this challenge so I'm gonna keep the ball rolling (please validate my comedy, Mr Beckham) by challenging @lian.sutton.
