We were dim sum dollies on Labour Day with delicious dim sum 🥟☕️from @thedimsumplace. It’s halal-certified so that more people can enjoy too. 😊

These bite-sized morsels are really impressively yummy! The char siew bun and siew mai are nice, despite the absence of pork as the duck/chicken meat used is tender and sweet. The molten salted egg custard bun is really good and dare we say, it’s even better than those we tried at some of the Chinese restaurants and just as good when we dined in previously. 
We got free delivery with min spend of $50. 😊
