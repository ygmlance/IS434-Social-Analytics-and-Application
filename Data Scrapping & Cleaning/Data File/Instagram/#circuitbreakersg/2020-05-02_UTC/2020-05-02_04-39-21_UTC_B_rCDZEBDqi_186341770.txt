No work is insignificant, all labour that uplifted humanity has dignity and importance. It should be undertaken with painstaking excellence. ♥️👍🏻
.
In other words, we should always be thankful to everyone and give everyone an encouragement. Saying "good job" and thanks for working hard for the society! 💪🏻♥️👍🏻
.
Without your contributions, there wont be a civilised society! If a $50 note will not change its value no matter how dirty or bad condition the note is, then the more every human being in this world will not change its value because of our social cultural differences such as, ethnicity, educational level, gender, nationality, occupation, religion, social status, languages etc... .
Because all bloods are red!!! ♥️

Labour day is a day we celebrate with each other and be grateful with what we have. No construction workers there wont be any shelter, no cleaners we wont have health, no farmers there wont be food, no foreigner workers leaving their home to work for us, there wont be home! 🙏🏻
.
Thank you everyone and I'm sorry for the belated labour day post. Cos I'm also working hard contributing to the society 😍👍🏻
.
Wishing you happy long weekend. ♥️👍🏻
