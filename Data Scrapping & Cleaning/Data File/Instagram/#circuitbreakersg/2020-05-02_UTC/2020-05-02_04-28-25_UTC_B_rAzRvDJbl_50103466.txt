To quote my teacher @wongshiouan I feel my Camel pose was not done properly in Sat morning class cos "I need more time to warm up the back". I continued my own Backbend practice but it was definitely not as long as Shiou An's haha. Beside practicing Camel pose again, I was intrigued by her Ustrasana variation. Wow is a challenge for my hips to push forward and push my foot beside my hip! And I can't stop my right foot from being "lazy". What a fierce 🐪 😳 Anyway courageous attempt🙏 Weekend warrior 💪Well done 👍🏻 #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg #stayhomesingapore #yogapracticeathome #backbendpractice #camelpose #ustrasana #camelposevariation #ustrasanavariation #heartopenerpose #mendoyogatoo
