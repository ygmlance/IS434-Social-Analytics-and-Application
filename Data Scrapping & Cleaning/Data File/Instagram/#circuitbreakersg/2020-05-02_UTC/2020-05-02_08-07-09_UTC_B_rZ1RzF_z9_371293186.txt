Circuit Breaker Day 26 - "protein loaded" meal to reward past 3 weeks abs workout discipline; didn't bother to make salad as I had my fibre from fruits at breakfast. Airfried pre-marinated wings for lunch on a cloudy Saturday afternoon. Airfried food has to be consumed while they are still hot because if you keep them beyond 2 hours, they tend to become rather dry & not too much a pleasure to eat them. 
600 grams of wings OR 20 large drumettes,1/2 tbs grapeseed oil/avocado oil, 1/2 tbs chilli powder, 1/2 tbs sweet smoke paprika OR paprika + 1 tsp of brown sugar, 3/4 tbs ground cumin, 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper (to add a bit more spicy flavour), 1 tsb garlic powder, 1 tsb onion powder, 1/2 tsb Himalian salt, 3/4 tsp pepper OR black pepper. 
A recipe from Pinterest & so happened that I'm having all the condiments in fridge. I calculated the condiments for marinating proportionately & indeed, reduced a bit more as I like to marinate wings for longer duration; to use less condiments but to give time for meat to absorb the flavours. Throw wings into ziploc bag & tuck into freezer for 4-5 days. Defrost wings at least a day before airfrying/baking them. So I've actually pre-planned to have them since yesterday morning & of course, be prepared to MOP the kitchen floor for FOUR rounds! Wanna eat my favourite airfried food, must pay a price of household chore. * Tip for airfrying raw wings ~ start wings at almost room temperature, use low heat below 150 degree celsius for 45 minutes to COOK the wings thoroughly, then higher heat at 160 degree celsius for next 30 minutes or longer by looking at the colour of wings (golden brown) + texture of skin (crispiness).
