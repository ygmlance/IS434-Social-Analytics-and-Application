Not easy get to try this Gram Pancake @gram_pancakes in Osaka because this is only available at specific timings with limited sets every day. We went twice to the cafe located at Shinsaibashi in a different days and timings also sold out within 30 mins. We did not queue for it upon it starts. Thankfully, we got to try it in our 3rd attempt when we just spotted it accidentally - another branch in Nishishinsaibashi(maybe is not tourist spot). This premium pancake ðŸ¥ž is soft, fluffy and bouncy! Mr.J like it very much ðŸ¤£ Right now, I am craving for dessert especially sliced cake during circuit breaker when stay home all day long! Dessert is very important to cheer up our mood though!
