What's your weekend plans?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Family time, catching up with family & friends, getting active, baking up a storm, unleashing your creative prowess, keeping it quiet, learning a new skill? So many options!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I'm planning on getting some work done after a bit of an unproductive week. Week 3 of #circuitbreakersg has been tough, mentally, so I haven't been massively productive but there is positive news today with some easing of restrictions starting from May 5th, which has massively lifted my spirits! After work, I am taking the time to enjoy this quieter period while I can, be grateful for what I have and reset for next week and the weeks ahead!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Would love to hear what you are at.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
