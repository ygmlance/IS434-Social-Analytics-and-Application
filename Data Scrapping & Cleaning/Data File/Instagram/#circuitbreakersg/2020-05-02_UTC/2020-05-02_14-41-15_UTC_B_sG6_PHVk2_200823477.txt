My first attempt baking cookies using #ninjafoodiop300, it's so fast and easy. Thou the capacity is not big, it's good enough for my family size. As a beginner for baking, I try to find easy baking recipes. Here's one that I found:

Homemade Animal Crossing Butter Cookies
Ingredients :
110g Butter
45g Powdered sugar
120g All-purpose flour
1/4 tsp Salt
Matcha green tea powder

Method:
Beat together butter and powdered sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer, add flour and salt and mix to combine. Divide dough into 3 portions. Coloured them accordingly. Wrap all dough and chill in the fridge for 30 mins. This will ensure that its easier to roll out and cut into shapes. Put the shaped cookies back to the fridge. Just be sure to chill it thoroughly so it keeps its shape while baking. Take out after 1 hr to bake. Place rack in the higher position onto the Ninja Foodi. Place cookies on the rack. Select Bake/Roast, set temperature to 150 degrees, set time to 15 - 20 mins. When cooking is complete, allow cookies to cool for 5 minutes.
