Today marks the halfway point of our children's Home-Based Learning (HBL) journey! 🎌

We would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to our curriculum team and teachers who worked extremely hard to ensure we provide quality HBL kits for our little ones. 🏠💕 Also, thank you parents, for following through the daily video streaming and activities.💻 🎨 This period may be difficult but by working together, we can overcome it! 🙌

With that, we would like to share some of the wonderful moments our children had at home during their HBL. 🌻
