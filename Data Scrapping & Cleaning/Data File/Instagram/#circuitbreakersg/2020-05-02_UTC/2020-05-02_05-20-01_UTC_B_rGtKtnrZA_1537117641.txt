Used 1 dough to bake 2 types of baked goods. After the first proofing, I made pizzas... one thin & one thick crust 🍕 Both gone in 10 mins cos they were so delicious.  The son liked the thick crust, the hub preferred the thin crust. I liked that the crusts were crispy on the outside & soft like bread on the inside ❤️ Ok now keeping my fingers crossed while waiting for my next item to be proofed... hopefully, they will turn out well too 🙏🏻
