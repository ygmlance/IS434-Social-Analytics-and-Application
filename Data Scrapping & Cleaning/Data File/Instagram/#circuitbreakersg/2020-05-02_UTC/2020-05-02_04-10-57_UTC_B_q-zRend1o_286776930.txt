Liang Jiugong, representing Emperor Kangxi, goes hunting outside the Great Wall. He rides an imperial steed that can travel 1,000 li a day. Outlaws of Chain-Bend Stockade hear about this and report to their chief, Dou Erdun. The latter has a grudge against Huang Santai, an officer under Liang Jiugong, and is determined to get even with him. He goes secretly into Liang's camp at night, kills a night watchman, and steals the horse, then leaves behind a poem implicating Huang Santai.
