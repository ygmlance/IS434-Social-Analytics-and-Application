Pan-grilled Chicken Inasal on a base of Quinoa and Kale. It is another of those attempts at cooking Filipino food w/o complete ingredients: poached boneless chicken thigh in an aromatic blend of olive oil, achuete powder, ginger, garlic, lemon zest (as a substitute for lemongrass), and lemon juice (as a substitute for vinegar), and pan-grilled to have some char. The only missing piece is that tangy, hot-ish Ilonggo suka dipping sauce. But amazingly, this dish went pretty well and finished in just a few minutes. So full from lunch today. #inasal #chickeninasal #filipinofood #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
