CB 26 out 56 Days . Todayâ€™s homecooked lunch was just simply to use up the remaining fresh pesto that I made yesterday. So just cooked penne, sausage, pesto together.  Then topped with shredded mozzarella ( Parmesan cheese was out of stock)
On a side note, it seems that the pasta sauces, pasta and even pasta cream were out of stocks at various supermarkets for the past two weeks. Either a lot of people are hoarding them or a lot of people are cooking pasta at home now.
