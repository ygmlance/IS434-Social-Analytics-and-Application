Homemade kuih Pie Tee~ just prepare the ingredients and cook the pie tee fillings took me 2 hours...cant imagine last time Nyonya how they made so many amazing peranakan cuisine which take a lot of time effort! I think for homemade fillings the veggie are more fresh and crunchy and you can have your favourite veggie mix, compare to buy those ready made fillings.
2 hours to prepare, less than 10 minutes to eat but I think is worth the effort if your family like it. Extra fillings can do popiah wrap tomorrow.
