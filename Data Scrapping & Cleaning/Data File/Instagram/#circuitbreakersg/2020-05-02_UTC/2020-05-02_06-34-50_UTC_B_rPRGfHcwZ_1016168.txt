#Circuitbreakersg day 25

Self deserving holiday coz itâ€™s May Day!
Had a simple but oh so good, made me do a little pirouette, me thinks itâ€™s so delish kinda dinner that no one will understand. But I DONT CARE coz it makes me happy ðŸ˜ƒ 
Dinner was : ðŸ”ºFrozen Greek yoghurt with one frozen banana and a bunch of frozen blueberries, blended and topped with some organic muesli. 
Always keep fruits that u cannot finish in the freezer becoz thereâ€™s so much one can do with them. ~
