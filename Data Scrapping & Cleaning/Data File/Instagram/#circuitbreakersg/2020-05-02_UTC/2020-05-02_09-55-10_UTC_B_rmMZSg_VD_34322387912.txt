“饮食男女”出自《礼记》，整句为：“饮食男女，人之大欲存焉“，意思是食欲与性欲都是人的基本需求。孟子又补了一句“食色性也”，也是同样的意思。读到这里，是否觉得古人透漏了一点佛洛伊德的智慧呢？⁣

The carved phrase is derived from the Book of Rites, which in its entirety claims that ‘the things which men greatly desire are comprehended in meat and drink and sexual pleasure’. In a similar vein, Mencius wrote ‘food and sex are in the nature of humans’. Doesn’t it seem like the ancients understood a bit of Freud’s ideas?⁣
