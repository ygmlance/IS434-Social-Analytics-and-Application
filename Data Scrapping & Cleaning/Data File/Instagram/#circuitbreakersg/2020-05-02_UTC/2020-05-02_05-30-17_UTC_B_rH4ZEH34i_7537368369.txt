I'm not sure there's a way to take a shot of a burrito aesthetically, but also I was too busy eating to have styled it properly. Ordered up @sumobarhappy for lunch today, and it turned out to be a real crowd pleaser - everyone loved their burrito and the nacho chips! (Phew, because I'm starting to get tired of figuring out what to feed everyone!)
