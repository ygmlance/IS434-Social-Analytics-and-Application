02 May 20 :: Day 26 of CB #circuitbreakersg. #sgunited #stayhomesg and #je55cooks Steamed #RadishCake #萝卜糕。

This was made yesterday in advanced for breakfast today. #mealplanning

We had stir-fried XO sauce radish cake #XO酱炒萝卜糕 and pan-fried radish cake.
.
Ingredients ::
1 white radish (approx. 700g), shredded
130g rice flour
1 tbsp corn flour
1/2 tsp each of sugar and salt
White pepper to taste [adjustable to preference] 
Dried mushrooms, washed, soaked and diced
Dried shrimps, washed, soaked and coarsely chopped
Lap cheong, removed skin and diced

Method ::
Simmer shredded radish with 1 cup of water for around 10mins. Remove cooked radish into a big mixing bowl. Pour leftover liquid into a measuring cup and top up water to make it to 1 cup. Add to mixing bowl with the cooked radish.

Stir-fried #爆香 mushrooms, dried shrimps and lap cheong until fragrant. Remove from heat and cool.

Add rice flour, corn flour, sugar, salt and white pepper to the mixing bowl with cooked radish. Mix until well-incorporated. Add in stir-fried ingredients and mix well.
Let sit for 20mins before steaming.

Lightly grease a loaf pan. Give a final stir to the mixture before pouring into loaf pan. Level the mixture. Steam over medium heat for 50mins. I inserted a toothpick in the centre of radish cake to check if it was fully cooked. Toothpick should comes out clean.

Let it cool down and firm up before cutting. I refrigerated the loaf pan once completely cool and sliced it this morning.

You can 自由发挥，have the radish cake steamed, pan-fried or stir-fried with XO sauce! I like the latter with a lot of cai po, garlic, eggs and tau-geh. 🤤
