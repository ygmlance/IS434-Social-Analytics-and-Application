🚉🚇 My first trip on the train back to office after 5 weeks of working from home. Knowing I will be only given 1 day to pack the whole marketing department after the CB. I applied for permit to return to office to do some packing.🛍 😊 Hehe.... 😅 Going out = Buying essential - food 😀 I will miss Chinatown food soon! 🤤
