First CB song yayyy ðŸ¥º
Please donâ€™t mind the extra double chin accumulated during this CB period HAHHA ðŸ¤£
And finally a song with a title - Someone I Can Understand ðŸ¤£

Tonight, I call for a lonely night 
Is this what it feels like 
I guess itâ€™s alright 
It burns, like whiskey on the rocks 
But somehow Iâ€™m like
One more time, no I donâ€™t want, it really burns 
But it has always been this way
For me

Cos I can laugh if it makes you feel everything 
But I canâ€™t live if all you feel for me is sympathy 
The telephone, it never rings 
And I donâ€™t know if I want it to

Iâ€™ll be alright 
Weâ€™ll be alright 
Iâ€™ve waited so long 
I could wait a little more 
I canâ€™t keep track of your jokes 
Can I be someone else 
Someone I can understand 
Cos I can laugh if it makes you feel everything 
But I canâ€™t live if all you feel for me is sympathy 
The telephone, it never rings 
And I donâ€™t know if I want it to

Iâ€™ll be alright 
Weâ€™ll be alright 
Iâ€™ve waited so long 
I could wait a little more 
In the middle of the night 
I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m alright 
Itâ€™s a simple sacrifice 
Just a little bit of time 
But I donâ€™t know how to be
Someone I can understand 
Cos I remember all the time 
Caught up in the lonely fight 
You were never kind with words 
Throwing shade and all the rocks 
But I donâ€™t know how to be 
Someone you can understand
