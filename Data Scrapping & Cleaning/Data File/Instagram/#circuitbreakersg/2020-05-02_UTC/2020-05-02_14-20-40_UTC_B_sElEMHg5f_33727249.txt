26/56 days of Circuit Breaker, 30 more days to go! Bite on~~~ Keeping my feed as lively as possible. Haha.

So what we've been up to... Nothing much but just be as socially responsible as possible to stay at home!

I'm a working mom, so it's not easy to juggle between WFH and having a toddler around. Yes, i do have my MIL helping me. But you see la... If inside room work and keep hear your todd in the living room crying non stop, you won't feel paiseh for not going out to coax your todd meh? ðŸ˜‚ Plus my MIL still need to settle housework + cook for us, i definitely cannot throw my girl from 9am to 6pm to take care mah.

So... i learnt to prioritize things. Making sure to take note of what timing my girl will get cranky, so i make sure i finish most important work task before that timing just that i can take over and settle her on and off before she goes crazy but still able to complete my work on time without delay. 
So far everything is good, routine has been fixed for her! *pats on my head for the good job* ðŸ¤­

This Circuit Breaker has indeed changed our lifestyle, the way we work, the way we lead our life without being able to go out jalan jalan and yet time still able to get through.

Before CB, weekdays are spent on work, when i got home after work, i wont have the extra energy to spend on Clara anymore. And weekends we are always heading out and not at home. So basically Clara doesn't have any hands on session. But ever since CB started, i get her to be engaged in hands on session which I've never did and realized that she likes it alot and she's a quick learner! 
As there's 30 days more before the CB ends, i must treasure and cherish the moment im able to stick to my girl for 24/7 everyday and expose her to more hands on and learning experience before we get back to the work force and be hustling bees again! â™¥
