When I was young, I enjoyed cream crackers in Milo in comparison to eating bread daily for breakfast. This morning to clear out some remaining granolas I combined crackers with the granolas and served them in milk. To add more flavour, I added figs. Itâ€™s sweet but mellowed down by the milk. #covid19 #circuitbreakersg
