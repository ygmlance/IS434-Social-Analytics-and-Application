How are you guys coping? Hope everyone is doing well! 
It's been 25 days since the Circuit Breaker started in Singapore on April 7.
Give yourself a pat on your back if you've managed to #StayHome as much as possible! Given that my usual lifestyle is already pseudo-quarantine🌚, this hasn't been that hard for me🌝 but still, hope everyone is doing fine at home 💪

We would like to say a big THANK YOU to all essential workers who are keeping Singapore safe amidst this pandemic!

Hang in there, just one more month before we can safely (and legally) head back out!
