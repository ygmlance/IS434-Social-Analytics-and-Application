Exactly five years ago on this day, we got married at One Degree 15 and I remember it was a Saturday too (just like today). Exactly one month from now, we will also be welcoming our firstborn to the family and we are all very excited.

We would of course very much love to celebrate our fifth wedding anniversary with a hotel staycation or a short getaway but given the current circuit breaker, that is not an option.

Thankfully, the super awesome people from @thenaughtychefsg (thank you Chef Augustine and Charlene) made this occasion an extraordinary one by whipping up some sumptuous Italian fare with a lovely touch of an All Chocolate Cake from @awfullychocolatesg.

We are indeed truly blessed! #weddinganniversary #weddinganniversarycake #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakerday26
