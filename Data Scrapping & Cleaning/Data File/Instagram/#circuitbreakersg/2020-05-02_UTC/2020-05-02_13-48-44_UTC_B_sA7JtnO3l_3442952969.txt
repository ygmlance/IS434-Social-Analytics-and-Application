A dinner we thoroughly enjoyed was Lebanese food from Urban Bites. ðŸŒ» The Zaatar Manouche (flat bread) is a favorite when dining in, so we were happy it also traveled well. ðŸŒ» My falafels hit the spot as did the pickles. ðŸŒ» An added plus, even though they advised the delivery might take time, it arrived early! ðŸŒ»
