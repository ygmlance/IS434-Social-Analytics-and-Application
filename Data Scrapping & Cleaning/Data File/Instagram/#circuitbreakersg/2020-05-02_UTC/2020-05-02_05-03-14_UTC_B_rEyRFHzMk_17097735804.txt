Open-faced egg salad on sourdough toast for #sahur this morning before commencing our fasting for the day. We would try to eat something that’s rich in protein. And eggs are usually our first choice because they are quick to make, can be prepped in advance, not to mention easier than trying to wolf down a slab of chicken at 5 a.m. 😂
