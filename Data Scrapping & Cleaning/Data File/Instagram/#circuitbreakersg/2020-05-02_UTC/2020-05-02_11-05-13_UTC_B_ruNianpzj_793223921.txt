When the same food is on lunch time repeat, you know it’s time to think of new options. If your cravings strike, we can bring our hearty and satisfying brunch staples (Hello, skillet baked eggs!) and wholesome sandwiches to your door this #stayhome weekend.

Delivery is available via @grabfoodsg, @foodpandasg and @deliveroo_sg. If you are located outside their delivery radius, fret not, we can deliver island-wide with a minimum order of $25. Just tap the link in bio to order! Also available for takeaway from our outlets except Capital Tower outlet. ⠀
