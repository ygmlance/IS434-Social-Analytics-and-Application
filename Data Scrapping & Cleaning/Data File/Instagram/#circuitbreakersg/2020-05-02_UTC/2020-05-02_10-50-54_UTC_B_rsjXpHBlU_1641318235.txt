We are staying home to catch up with house chores! Here's how our May Day looked liked❣️⁣
⁣
May, my fave month, because it's my birth month; the month with the most PH and long weekends this year, but why does it not matter anymore...⁣
⁣
But here's my boy who made it so much better! And he voluntarily and happily did these on his own accord! Watch till end to see what he worked so hard for? 😝⁣
⁣
P.S. please excuse the mess, we are too busy making memories! 😜⁣
⁣
P.P.S. the cheeky boy 懂事了! @dustydale @pcknitcrochet, what have y'all been up to these days?⁣
