Many of my clients had their gel nail done before the Covid-19 circuit breaker. 
Now it’s coming 1 month, nail has either grows long or started to chip. 
I created this video to help you do it yourself at home. The material you need can easily find at home or buy from pharmacy (Guardian and Watson still open).
Tools u need:
- scissor (cut aluminum foil and cotton wool)
- aluminum foil (cheapest brand will do)
- cotton wool
- polish remover (any brand as long contains acetone) 😱 juz realized my removal was manufactured in 2016 and it still works well!!!)
- buffet block (use sand paper with grit 600 above if don’t hv buffer)
-file (use sand paper with grit 180-240 if don’t hv file)
- orange stick (use disposable chopstick, taper and flatten one of the corner)
This is only emergency solution to help you since you are not able to find any nail salon (non essential service) to remove. It’s still best to leave it to professional to do. 
See you back after CB.
