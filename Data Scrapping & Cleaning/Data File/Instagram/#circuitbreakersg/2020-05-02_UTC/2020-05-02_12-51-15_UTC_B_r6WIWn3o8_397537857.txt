#CircuitBreakerSG D-26
It's been a while since I last made Char Siew and the family reminded me again when I did my grocery shopping.

The other 2 dishes are blanced Bok Choy & steamed Tofu with Cai Po.

Soup of the day is nourishing & rejuvenating Herbal Chicken Soup. Some of the herbs used are 玉竹，淮山，当归，党参，北芪 & 枸杞.

Enjoy your #dinner too!
