Homemade fettuccine alle vongole for dinner tonight. ðŸ˜Š

First time making pasta and really enjoyed the experience. And more importantly, the pasta turned out really well and has a nice bite. Will definitely be making more pasta soon! ðŸ˜ƒ

I am grateful today because Iâ€™m happy that the homemade pasta turned out great and that I enjoyed dinner. #gratitudediary
