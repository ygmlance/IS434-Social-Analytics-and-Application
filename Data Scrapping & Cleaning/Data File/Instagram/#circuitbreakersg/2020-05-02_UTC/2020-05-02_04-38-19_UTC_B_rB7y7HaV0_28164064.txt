< 🍓 Strawberry,🍌 Banana, 🧀 Cottage Cheese, & Granola on Sourdough Toast >

Was intending to make eggs beni on toast or sthg but realised that my family had cut up & prepped the sourdough toast I got from @bakerybrera yesterday. So I decided to do a sweet version instead, using the Russion Truvog cheese that sis @missmontblanc made.

Homemade Brunch checked - at caféglamjane. Haha 😄
