Homemade Fried Carrot Cake with chopped garlic, chopped shallots, eggs, oily crab meat and seasoned with premium Vietnamese fish sauce. Yum! 😋⁣
⁣
For the oily crab meat, fry chopped garlic (125g) and shallots (250g) till fragrant with lots of oil (about 500ml), then add a can of crab meat (450g) and some salt, and continue to fry for a few minutes before transferring to a container. The longer the crab meat is steeped in the oil, the better the flavour! The oily crab meat goes superbly well with plain rice and noodles too! 👍🏻👍🏻
