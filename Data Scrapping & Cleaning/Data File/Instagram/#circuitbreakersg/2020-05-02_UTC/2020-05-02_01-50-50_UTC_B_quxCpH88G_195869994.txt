According to the papers, this pandemic is going to last as long as 2 years. Because of its ability to spread from people who don't appear to be ill, these people may actually be at their most infectious before their symptoms appear. Wearing masks will be the part of the NEW NORMAL until Vaccines for Covid-19 are available! ðŸ˜·

Yet, not all masks are the same. While you may know the differences between reusable cloth mask, surgical mask, medical mask, etc., you may not know that even Surgical Mask has different grades too!

Because it's MADE IN SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬!! I felt assured to know Bio-LabOne masks are manufactured in clean room and all their masks are sterilised before packing!

Maintaining such high standard also means Bio-LabOne masks are made to meet medical grade for CE and FDA certification. Bio-LabOne's 3-ply Surgical Face Mask has more than 95% Filtration Efficiency (BFE) that filters out more than 95% of germs and bacteria, nose bar adaptability, and is hypoallergenic and breathable though it felt thicker and of better quality than the current masks we are using. 
Prices start at $25/box of 50s
Do your pre-order before 20 May to enjoy special prices! ðŸ‘‡
