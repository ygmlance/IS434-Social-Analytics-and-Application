Homemade Lo Mai Kai.
.
Made with Glutinous Rice steamed with Chicken, Mushrooms & XO Lup Cheong better known as Chinese Sausages. This delicious traditional dish is extremely popular & widely available but nothing beats homemade.  A little time consuming, it starts the night before, but well worth the effort.

2 Portobello mushroom halved (shiitake is the alternative I didnâ€™t have any)
1 tbsp dark soy sauce
1 tbsp Hua Tiao wine
1 tbsp sesame oil

@kwongwohhingsaucefactory soya and dark sauces make all the difference.

I paired it with @aromacookery homamde Radish cake which I lightly pan fried to crisp on the outside. The flavours was so good!
