The easing of some Circuit Breaker measures from 5th May had us dancing with joy because (a) we no longer need to look like Tom Hanks in "Castaway" and (b) ice-cream!!! /

On this joyous occasion we cooked wanton noodles for dinner. Some prefer boiled wantons, some prefer fried ones, so why not have both? Home made char siew and veggies completed the dish.
