Was gonna go on strike for Labour Day.... But forced myself to make dinner after another Very Inspiring Lunch ... (see last pic). Spinach and eggs in a pan, frozen paratha (lol) and French tomato soup w only butter n no cream!! Tomato soup was excellent even if I say so myself #stayhome #circuitbreakersg  #sgunite #mycooking #surprise #homecooking
