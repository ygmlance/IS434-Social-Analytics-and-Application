[Day 19] Funtime Challenge Theme: Dinosaurs ðŸ¦•ðŸ¦–
.
.
Today is actually Day 26. Supposedly the day for Safari! Have been late in posting these few days due to the sudden new circuit breaker ban that affected all Home Based Businesses. .
.
Nevertheless, our everyday challenge is a guide and idea inspiration for fellow mummies to create your own sensory play! .
.
So here is a throw back of our favourite pre-historic animals, Dinosaurs theme that we did few days back! .
.
Little Avery has tons of questions with each dinosaur. Luckily, daddy is here to save the day to reply to her thousands and one question. No one has lived long enough to meet them, so all we can do is imagine and pretend play on what dinosaurs would do say to day.
