Just had an absolutely brilliant dinner thanks to the lovely folks at @esquinasg. Frankly we may have overindulged a little -- between the two of us we polished off ham croquetas, roasted cauliflower, almost a full pan of carabinero paella meant for 3-4 pax, two mini Basque cheesecakes and a bottle of Rioja -- but everything was so tasty we couldn't resist.

For once we didn't have to fight over the paella (!!); and those mini cheesecakes are seriously da bomb (so good they almost made me forget about my fav BBC). Also loved the personalised messages and sketches on the carrier bag -- you guys are the sweetest!

Big THANK YOU and lots of love to @carlosmontobbio, @myra.buccat, Karen and team -- can't wait for #circuitbreakersg to end so we can see you guys again!
