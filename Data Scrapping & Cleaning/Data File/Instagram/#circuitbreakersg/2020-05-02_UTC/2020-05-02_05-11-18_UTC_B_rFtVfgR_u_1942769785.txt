• Spend five to ten minutes enjoying the sun. ☀️ Sunlight changes everything (after living three years in Finland, I really mean it). Just feel the sun in your skin. And smile! ⁣
⁣
• Keep a daily gratitude journal. You don’t need to write huge daily lists. Write 3 or 5 things you are really grateful for each day. ⁣
⁣
• Keep to your routine. ⁣
⁣
• Watch funny videos. Laugh!! ⁣
⁣
• Drink plenty of water and limit coffee and alcohol. ⁣
⁣
• Cook nourishing food. ⁣
⁣
• Use your essential oils. I’m loving these days Balance, Motivate, and Cheer topically, and Peppermint in my diffuser. They lift my mood and my spirit. Which ones are you into lately?
