First joint baking project with Leong mama for advanced Mother's Day celebration! We have been watching too much baking videos on Youtube during CB period and this trigger us to bake something too! So today we decide to attempt to make our own mini sausage buns, hawaiian ham & pineapple pizza plus chicken & onion pizza.
😁😊😋
