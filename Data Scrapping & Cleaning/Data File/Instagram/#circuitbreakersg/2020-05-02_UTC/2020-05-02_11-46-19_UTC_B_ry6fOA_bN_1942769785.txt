Circuit Breaker. Day 26. Saturday. Time to hit the big pause button. I worked hard last week, and next week will be crazy (apparently we are getting all our stuff on Tuesday 🙌🏻). I’m tired and though I’m happy the moving-abroad chapter is coming to an end and our mats and juice maker and books and everything will be finally here, I know it’s gonna be exhausting. So, today I spent the day resting and watching Netflix cuddling with @meksikolainen and the gang. 💛 Also... daydreaming we will be able to hang out soon and get to know and enjoy this city.
