This weekend, here's the next idea for parents after reading "Murphy, See How You Shine!" with your child!

Create a different ending to the story:
Using the simple 3-panels comic strip template below, get your child to create another way he/she would like the story to end. The sky's the limit! 
Have fun :) And once again, I would love to hear from you if you have something to share with me about what your child creates. PM me!
