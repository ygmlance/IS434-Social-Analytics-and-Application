Ordered in from @parisbaguette_sg today. Need to hang up apron for now as it has been a hectic week. Thanks to the team for providing their usual good quality food with island wide delivery and their box promo. Stay strong, and look forward to dining at @parisbaguette_sg again after circuit breaker!
