No it doesn't work! Not sustainable la! How can eat so much fats still drop dress size? I don't even see you on an diet. Drink ketones daily only so easy?

Yesterday Dan asked me when was the last time I celebrated my progress.. And my first reaction was.. Don't want la. No change la. I don't feel any different.. But I'm glad I did even when I didn't feel like it!! I can't argue the results, neither can I argue the sustainability. And look at me, do I look like I am on a bland boring diet? I'm craving mookata so much we are making our own lard and pouring it over everything. And if you can't shake up a bottle of ketones omat least once a day, no diet or meal replacement can help you la.
