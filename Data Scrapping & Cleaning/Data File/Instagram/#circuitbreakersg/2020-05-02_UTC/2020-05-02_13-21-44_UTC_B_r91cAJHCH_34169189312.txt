Officially hit the 1 month mark since we started our plant-based journey together and we have been noticing some positive effects of going plant-based 🌱. For starters, both of us have definitely been feeling less lethargic and having more energy throughout the day 💪🏻

For sy, she used to have chronic lower back aches and often headed to the chiropractor to ease the pain. After not consuming meat-based foods (which are known to cause inflammation in our bodies), her back aches has improved significantly🧑🏻‍⚕️

For myself, the obvious change for now is that my acne has cleared up and my skin feels healthier. More importantly, I’m hoping that my cholesterol level will decrease to <200mg/dL upon my next checkup as I’m currently in the higher range (252mg/dL) per my doctor 🙇🏻‍♀️

Looking forward to continue our journey and excited to explore more food options together💕
