#Circuitbreakersg Day 26
.
Great Chocolatey taste!
. 
Throwback to when I was a kid and flavoured breakfast cereals were a staple. Got my hands on a small packet of Koko Krunch to reignite that joyful feeling
.
Out of all those available in the market, I used to enjoy mostly Froot Loops & Coco Pops, cos "Coco PopsÂ make milk go choc!" . Now, granola can be found in my pantry - adulting ðŸ˜œ I make my own granola sometimes, adding my favourite toppings so it becomes a tasty snack as well
.
What was your favourite childhood breakfast cereal?
