这些天，买菜都成了一项艰巨的任务…😰 要戴口罩、排队测量体温、扫描身份证，被确认OK了，才能进入超市😓 超市里又是到处人龙在排队买鸡、猪、鱼。没人龙的走道不是冰箱已被扫空，就是存货有限。不容易啊😫

These Chicken Kiev were inspired by @sixpmfooddairy I used dried parsley (couldn’t get fresh ones), but I also added the lime zest for the green colour pop. The son and me really liked that chicken breast was moist and flavourful. The hubby called for thigh meat next time. 😳😏 知道某人一定嫌饭太干，又煮了cream sauce 给他…没想到，他还是嫌不够湿😳 难伺候……

@sixpmfooddiary You were right! Cutting the pockets in the chicken was indeed the most daunting task. I found myself worrying about making holes in the chicken or accidentally cutting myself the whole time!😅
