Today, we will be brown sugar boba! I am sure everyone is craving for their bubble tea now!! Boba simply stands for tapioca pearls that are made with brown sugar or gula melaka (palm sugar). The difference between regular pearls and boba is that boba are more chewy and definitely more sweet, and what makes it so addictive is brown sugar. To make your very own boba at home is so so simple! All you need is just 3 ingredients and within 30 minutes, plenty of boba is ready!

I am sure there's no need for further introduction on bubble tea! 
The ingredients we need are:
1.) 140 grams of Tapioca Flour
2.) 70 grams of Brown Sugar / 70 grams of Gula Melaka
3.) 100 grams of Water
