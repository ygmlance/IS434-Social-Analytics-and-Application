CB ~ Day 26
With most of us quarantined at home, uncertain of the future, and testing days ahead, it is natural to feel blue and even panic (a little bit). However, at such times (rare, trying times), it is important to change our outlook towards self-isolation as something unfortunate. Instead, we must look at it as a time to slow down, rejuvenate, be grateful and do all our favorite things, which includes sleeping for long hoursðŸ˜œ. First time in history, please letâ€™s not screw this up!

On a lighter note, where can I get my air katira?! Ha.
