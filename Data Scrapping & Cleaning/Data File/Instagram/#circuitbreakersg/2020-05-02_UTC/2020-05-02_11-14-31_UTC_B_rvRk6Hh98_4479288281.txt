Lockdown Day 46 — When you can’t paint the town red, you paint your kitchen (door) blue... green... orange... whatever your heart fancies!! 🤪😄

It’s definitely a very different experience painting on a smooth, glossy surface versus my usual cotton canvas or linen. .
.
But I love that splash of colour and the fiesta feel. 😂 Just wonder if it’ll be kinda creepy when I sneak in for some snacks in the middle of the night. .

Part of the abstract “scratches” artwork was proudly contributed by my dog.🙄 .
