The day I sat staring at the toilet paper tubes, trying to imagine them as potential pieces of art, and drawing a total blank. For all the toilet paper jokes lately made, these humble cardboard discards have featured in many a great #craft creations. Anyhow, so I stare at them, having exhausted all obvious ideas in the past one month of #homeschooling, when Shivin casually picks them up, ties them together with my hairband lying around, and announces: look Mommy: Binoculars! Humbling moment, yes ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜…. Then we go on to paint them, and eventually ditch the band (in the pic), for some glue. One of the most powerful parenting lessons learnt today - involve them, they may just have better ideas 'sometimes' ðŸ˜ŠðŸ™ƒðŸ˜…. #ShivInDaHouse #toiletpaper #binoculars #lockdown #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #stayhomei #kidsofinstagram
