DAY 43, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
Murgh Saagwala

A tiny twist to the regular recipe. Added a little brocolli to it like the Saag paneer I did a few days ago. Believe me, as strange as it sounds, the brocolli just enhances the taste. @food2goodbypriti Sweetie, the hard core non-vegtarian in me was waiting to try out this version of saag too. Thanks so much once again, it worked super good for chicken too 😘

Will post the recipe in the comments by tonight. 
Vegetarians can just replace the chicken with paneer or tofu 🤷‍♀️
Have a great "last 11 days of CB" peeps!!
