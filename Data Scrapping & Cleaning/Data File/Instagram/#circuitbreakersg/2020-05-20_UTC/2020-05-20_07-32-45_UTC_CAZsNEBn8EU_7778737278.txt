#circuitbreakersg It was one of those days where I felt hardworking and decided to put this on the menu for dinner. (It was a mistake, on hindsight 😅)
.
Slicing the vegetables were easy. Even frying the tamago was simple enough. Salmon was almost zero effort coz I popped it in the airfryer. But frying the enoki. OMG! That was back breaking labour. I stood at the stove dipping batter, flipping in oil and regretting my choice of ingredients.

Still. Something super crispy and crunchy added such a great bite in the sushi rolls.  As you can see, I still have alot more practice needed to improve my sushi rolling skills. Super uneven circles and some rolls were not tight enough they almost burst. 😆🍣🍤🍣🍤🍵
