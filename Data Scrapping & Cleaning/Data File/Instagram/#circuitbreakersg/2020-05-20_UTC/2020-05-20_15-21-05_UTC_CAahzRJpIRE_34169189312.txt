Ipoh horfun - one of the few comfort foods around CBD that we miss since circuit breaker started🍲 Perfect for a simple after-work dinner on the way home 💕

For the sauce, stir-fry tons of garlic, shallots, shitake mushroom, add in dark / light soy sauce, vegetarian oyster sauce, salt, pepper and water. Simmer for 10-15mins. Separately, blanch fresh veggies (we chose Chinese spinach) & horfun 🥬

When ready to serve, add in some corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up and drizzle it over the horfun 🍲🌶😋 #plantbased #wholefoods #homecooked #dinner #simple #yummy #health #stayhome #sgfood #sgeats #circuitbreakersg #singaporehomecooks #sghomecooking #healthyfoodsg #eatcleansg #ipohhorfun #ipoh #chinesefood #comfortfood #pbandveggies
