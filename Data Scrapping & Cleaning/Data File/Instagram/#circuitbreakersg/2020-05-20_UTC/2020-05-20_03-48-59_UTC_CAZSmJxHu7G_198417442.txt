💖Double Ebi Burger💖

These ebi katsu patties from @redmartcom are so crunchy after air frying them. They are made with loads of visible real prawns. 😍 Paired with gluten free burger buns that are more chewy than the normal brioche burger buns. Reminded me of bagel texture. For the sauce, I mixed chipotle powder with kewpie mayo. I love chiptole spice! It is spicier than chilli powder and has a smoky flavour to it! 🔥 And of course what is a burger without cheese! 💓
