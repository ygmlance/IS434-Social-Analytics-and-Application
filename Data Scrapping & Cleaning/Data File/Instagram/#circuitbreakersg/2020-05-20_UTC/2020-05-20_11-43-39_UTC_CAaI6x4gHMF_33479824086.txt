LEG DAY - SWIPE 👉

I think I’m starting to really love leg day even more getting creative with my workouts using the simplicity of the environment around me and minimal equipment. The thing about working with bands and light weights is that it completely resets your training, knowing you won’t be able to slap on another 45lbs plate on the bar or max out on leg press or hit that PR, puts things in perspective that you really only have a light dumbbell to work with and resistance of a rubber band - so you have to create greater tension through time under tension, pause reps, explosive reps, be aware of tempo, be even more aware of the muscle group the exercise you’re doing is intended for - it’s like an artist that gets so caught up in his painting, he eventually just loses himself in brush strokes rather than a feeling he’s trying to convey. For me, training this way, with nobody around is actually very productive - I get to learn new things, reconnect, rediscover and synch my mind to my movements, so when the gyms open up again - I’ll just pick up where I left off, with an arsenal of new ideas.

The only thing I had trouble with in this workout is the pistol squat - knee surgery recovery hasn’t been too kind 😂 in my defense I never usually do them. Anyway, let me know what you guys think! ⚡️
