This Circuit breaker, I often need to throw on an extra layer of clothing *brrrr* and really crave for mala hotpot. I think we need another HDL dinner soon. Why? Cuz Our home feels like winter every single day. Mr hubby @rupert.gpc and Mr Leonidas @thisisleonidasgan likes to run the aircon on full blast ❄ The first action they enter a room is to pick up the controller and switch on the aircon. Normally all 8 units will be on full blast by mid noon 🤧 The boys also like to put on a fashion show at home (change of clothes 👕👖) Daddy change cuz he has to look presentable for work, son change cuz 🐒 monkey see monkey do (the boy dont change out of pj and into normal home clothes, he puts on nice shirts and pants that's suitable to go jalan jalan) 😅 son change again cuz son wants to nap in a comfy outfit, son change again, cuz he took a bath in the noon 😂 and son change again, into another set of pajamas, cuz he took another bath before hitting slumberland. Lol! So what about mommy? she has no choice but be another monkey lor, did the same ( If the boys bother about dressing up at home, mommy also cannot relax right) Lol! But you reap what you sow is real, we've a huge laundry pile to conquer every week 🧺 God bless whoever invented the washing machine and dryer 😛
