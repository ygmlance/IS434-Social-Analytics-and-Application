Join Sheena Ling for 12 sessions of insights and wisdom building.

Sheena has been in the field of training for leadership, facilitation and team building since 2006, specialising in the development of social emotional intelligence for youths and young adults.

All in which shouldn't matter as much as - her having 2 cats
.
- being brought up by her grandparents
.
- studying IT in poly, hated it, and retained a year
.
- her believing that our world truly thrives only when we spend our living hours being authentic and giving
.
- and that we must do whatever takes to restore honour, love, and high standards back into our culture
