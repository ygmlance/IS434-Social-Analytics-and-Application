🔴With so many food choices (islandwide delivery) available on grab, I could not resist the temptation of checking out #violetoonsingapore I ordered the following: Babi Pong Tay, and Chap Chye. The two dishes were good but could be made a little more robust. The Nonya Chap Chye was a lot more bland. I was still happy with my dinner, the only downside was the time it took to deliver. I was 20km away from the restaurant, and the food was cold when I received them. That being said, #violetoonsingapore deserves a 👍🏻 nevertheless. #sgfood #sgfoodie #supportlocalsg #nonyafood #singapore #instafood #instagood #stayhome #staysafe #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker
