Thank you hubby! 520! After a long day of juggling work, housework and 2 kiddos at home, the surprise dinner delivery with favourite Gong Cha is so welcoming! Yup, that’s the way to my ❤️! (PS: The hubby didn’t know what 520 stands for until I tell him earlier today.... Guess this is my 520 present! #bubbletealover #happywifehappylife #happyfood #easilypleased😂 #520 #dinnertime #happytoseeyou #longtimenosee #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #covid19 #longwednesday @thatunclesam
