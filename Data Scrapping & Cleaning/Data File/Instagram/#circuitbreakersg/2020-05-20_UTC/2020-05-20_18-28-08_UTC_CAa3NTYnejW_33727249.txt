Decided to do some #throwback at this timing as i realised that I've got so many photos that i didn't post for keepsake purpose ðŸ˜…

10 March 2019; Princess Clara's 1st month celebration ðŸŽ‰â™¥
Although I'm counted as an event coordinator at work, planning for myself is not an easy task especially during confinement period ðŸ˜£
Location, food caterer and cake vendor was only confirmed 1 week before the celebration ðŸ˜…ðŸ™ˆ As you can see... Photos are not well taken cos i didn't engage any photographer and it was sooooo chaotic as i have 100+ guest at one time ðŸ¤¯

But anyway, I'm glad that we had this celebration for Clara to share our happiness with our family, relatives and friend's presence â™¥
