I have no fancy name for this Bee Hoon. 
However if you are looking to add mushrooms to your kids' diet or for someone who dislike the taste of mushroom, maybe this might help.

Using king oyster mushroom, cut the mushroom into thin slices diagonally before cutting them into thin strips. Do the same for the carrots.

Get a few cloves of garlic and chopped them finely. Saute slightly in the pan with some oil before adding the mushrooms and carrots. Add 1 cup of water, 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of chinese cooking wine, 2 teaspoons of @sghomemade Japan Scallop powder and let it simmer for 5 to 10 mins. 
When the mushrooms are ready, toss in your scrambled eggs, prawns and give a good mix before adding in pre-soaked bee hoon. Add in other seasonings such as light soy sauce or fish sauce. Mix thoroughly. The bee hoon needs to have at least one-third soaked in the gravy. So add in more water and taste test again. Cover with lid and let the bee hoon simmer for another 10 mins. Give it a mix every now and then. When done, cover with lid first and let the bee hoon absorb all the gravy. 
The thinly strips of mushrooms will blend in very well with the bee hoon, and barely visible. A good way to ninja your way through (apart from the visible dark-coloured mushroom cap). ðŸ˜Ž

Enjoy!
