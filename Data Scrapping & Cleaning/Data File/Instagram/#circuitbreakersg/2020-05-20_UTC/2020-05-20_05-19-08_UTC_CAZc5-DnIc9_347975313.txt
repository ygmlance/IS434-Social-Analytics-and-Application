Dear Brides-to-be, 
I can really feel your pain of planning your wedding this year or even next year. As we heard  about the new measures after Circuit Breaker, with weddings only allowing upto 10 pax or lower, is planning our dream wedding still possible ?

Should you just abandon your wedding plan and go with  a minimal setup and just sign the papers ? 
Should you let go of the dream of having a beautiful wedding, marching- in with your dad or loved ones, bearing the brunt of having a wedding in Covid era ?

Don’t get we wrong, I fully support virtual weddings and getting married within social distancing measures. What I am saying is, maybe there’s a way for you, to still have the beautiful wedding that you imagined while browsing those pretty pictures in Pinterest.

I feel your pain as I have to plan dozens of weddings in 2020 for our couples. We are all unsure of the future but one thing for sure, creativity lives on, and so should your bridal dreams.

I am determined to help you to get your Instagrammable wedding with whatever resources you have. After all, maybe the only wedding pictures your friends will ever see is through your Instagram.

So join me on 30 May 2020 at 2pm as I share my tips on how to plan an Insta-worthy wedding within your budget.

Love,

Hellen
