Day 253. 8 months 10 days. My first 520.

Baby 👶🏻: Mama Papa I love you! ❤️ My first 520 spent with Mama Papa around me. Though they are still working hard, but at least they are home together with me! Haha. Hopeful that weekend will come earlier so that I can play with Mama and Papa more!

Meal:
🥣 Lunch: Spinach + Cherry + Pomegranate purée
Dinner: Sweet potato purée + Yogurt + Star biscuit + Biscotti
I really enjoyed the biscuits given by Papa and Mama. Hence, this satisfied smile shown to notify Mama to give me more next round 😂. #EnzoTay
