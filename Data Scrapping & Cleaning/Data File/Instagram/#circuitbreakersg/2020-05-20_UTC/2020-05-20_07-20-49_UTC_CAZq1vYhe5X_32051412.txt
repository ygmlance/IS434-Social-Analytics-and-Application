No pain = no gain? ☠️ Got off my butt to try out a intense series of front splits classes with @elenalenalenochka last week. Had never tried a virtual-led workout before, was pleasantly surprised at effectiveness (perhaps less happy with the pain 😂)
.
Elena really tries her best to both lead the class by modeling the stretches, while also looking out for her students to ensure they maintain correct and safe postures – really not an easy balancing act 🙌 .
Hamstrings were successfully beaten into submission by the end of the classes, showed me that one really doesn't have to be in a studio to get a good workout 😓
