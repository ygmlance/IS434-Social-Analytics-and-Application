Last nite #cb #dinner tried @willcookwilleat recipe. Thanks for sharing and credit to @willcookwilleat It comprises of #porkbelly #leek #potatoes so yummy. The one thing is the leeks were too big in thickness which tasted a little raw.  Otherwise it would be perfect and good.. #cbcooking #circuitbreakersg
