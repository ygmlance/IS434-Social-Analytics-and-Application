I might not get to try Playmade if not for circuit breaker and food collaboration and group buys... The Chrysanthemum Tea was very sweet for a 0%. Pink Cactus Pearls were generous and chewy but nothing mind-blowing, but it was a great idea to pack the pearls separately to maintain freshness and so I get more tea! I wanted to get the Jin Feng Chicken Cutlet combo but the website had glitches so I have to settle for a mediocre chicken wing from #JinFengLuRouFan #jiakbyjinfeng #jinfeng #playmade #pinkcactuspearls #chrysanthemumtea #chickenwing #丸作 #bubbletealover #foodporn #instafood #foodstagram #sgfoodblogger #foodiegram #foodphotography #singaporefood #circuitbreakersg  #foodgasm #sgfood #circuit #fatbearcationeats #bobalife #creativefood #groupbuy #supportsmallbusiness #circuitbreakersg #fooddeliverysg
