Hola friends and fam, so I did this awesome project with @dstnctsg DSTNCT collecting stories of Singaporeans from different walks of life. In it are some awesome photos by @pixioo Photography❤️ and a letter I wrote to Covid19, which became more of a shout-out to the industry. 😔😔😔
It’s cool that the site launches today cause I know some of us are a bit depressed at the new measures announced. It’s circuit breaker light for some us but baby steps I guess. Feel free to share and do check out the warm and much less vulgar profiles. 😷
