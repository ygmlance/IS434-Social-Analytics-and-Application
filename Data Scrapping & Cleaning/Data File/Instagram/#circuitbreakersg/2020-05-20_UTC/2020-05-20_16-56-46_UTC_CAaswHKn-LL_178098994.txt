〰️So, we have progressed from "Orange" to "Phases"? 😅 Think: ANNOYING ORANGE. 🤣〰️ 🔴CASIO AE1300WH-4AV🔴

Didn't get the popular "Casio Royale" version with the metallic finish and bracelet but opted for this. The original strap was black resin strap but switched to a translucent white one. Trying to pull off the 🍎 watch feel. Haha!

Cheap and reliable. Perfect for exercises and water activities. What more can you ask for?
