Recreational activities in school? Not till July after SR transition to ST for Singapore! .
.
Kids will have to do their own recreational activities with their household members then, and HBL will continue on alternate week for primary & secondary schools students. .
.
So parents, brace for longer HBL & perhaps itâ€™s here to stay forever! .
.
Meanwhile just kick a few balls & have fun with your kids while navigating CB exit...
