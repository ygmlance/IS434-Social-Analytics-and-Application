Jade Gua Sha or Jade Roller?

Read so many different reviews about the two and I just couldn’t decide which to get. Both of them seemed to do the same but also different stuff. Was torn between the two so guess what? I bought both 🤣
.
Also learnt that there are so many “fake” jade rollers. So I decided to get mine from @mountlai .
Ok... The truth is I feel both are very much similar, ie. give me better skin! Hopefully!!! .
Always can’t resist stuff that apparently does good for the skin. This prolonged period without putting on make up had made me realize that my skin needs to be saved badly... Hormonal changes during the two pregnancies also didn’t do my skin many favours!
.
To better skin!!!
