By placing your head on Mother Earth give you enough reasons to be grateful. .
-
-
Thankful for her unconditional love, nurturing & feeding us & allowing us to walk on her Heart without complaining. She is ever giving & ever loving -
-
But Like any mother she got really angry & upset for not paying heed to her despite warning us through various channels to mend our ways, but we never changed due to our stubbornness, selfishness & greed.

Lo! & behold she came full throttle & now we are quiet like a lamb & hiding like rats in the burrows. Looks like Roles have reversed as animals are walking free without fear., in contrast to human beings who are scared & locked down
-
Interestingly Mother Nature has shown us who the Real Hero (CONTROLLER ) is. ðŸ˜‡
