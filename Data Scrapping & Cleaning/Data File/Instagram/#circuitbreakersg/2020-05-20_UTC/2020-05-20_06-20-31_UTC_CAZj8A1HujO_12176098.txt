I cried my eyes out last night knowing that my wedding may not happen in July. Past incident has made the topic on marriage little shaky on the inside for me. I’m just a girl who wants to be married to the guy she loves (sounds similar to what Julia Roberts said in Notting Hill) but jokes aside I am scared. I am frustrated. I am upset. I’m on an emotional rollercoaster right now. 
I can adapt to situations well but for some reason THIS just pierces my heart to the core. The different emotions and thoughts that I am going through right now just tires me out. I have put a pause on guest list, invites, etc. It looks like I can’t press the play button anytime soon. 
Despite my emotions, I am choosing to trust in Daddy God because he knows best and his timing is always right. I know He is with me in this journey and has my back each time. 
But I’m only human (sings)... On my way to get my swab test done and I couldn’t pause my tears. STOP CRYING GAYLE! #gettingrealnow #teachergonewild #circuitbreakersg #laughterinsadness #itsoktocry #daddygodhasmyback #MeetTheHendersons #onpause
