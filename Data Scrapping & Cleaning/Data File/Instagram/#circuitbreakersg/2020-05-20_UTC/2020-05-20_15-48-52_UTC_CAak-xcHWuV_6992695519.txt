Throwback to last year May... when can we go for staycation or a short trip again...🥺🥺🥺
.
Kids had been very well behaved during this #circuitbreakersg ... we were home since Day 1 of CB till now... no complains and no asking why... they had been doing their home assignments daily except for Sundays without complains and of course their rewards are games after that...
.
They never once complained about my bad cooking skills haha... everything i cooked they eat... im blessed with these 5 naughty kids... .
They miss their grandparents (my parents!!!) and uncle so much... Day 44
