@madebykaico is something Iâ€™ve been working on for a couple of months since I got interested in what they call, alternative medicine. Using plants, herbs and naturally derived ingredients to heal common illness or cut & scrapes with homemade salves and more. 
it was then I realise it is not easy to constantly create content that fits the theme of my feed and brand, I have to plan on what I should post, one after another. 
I also, love aesthetically-looking quotes that you see on Pinterest, and sadly I cannot be using everything on that profile (yes because Iâ€™m not going to mess up the colour palette ðŸ™ƒ) so Iâ€™m going to share it over here at hellouteki! 
They are not fancy hand-drawn art but I hope someone finds these quotes helpful and brings joy to their life! â˜¾
