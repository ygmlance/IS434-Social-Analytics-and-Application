Our My First Skool HBL Activity (Listen and Move!)⠀
⠀
During this Covid-19 circuit breaker period, My First Skool has developed a series of home-based learning resources and activities for parents to engage their child in learning.⠀
Listen and Move! is one of the HBL activity provided by MFS which Alyssa loved and enjoyed. Initially, she experienced difficulty with the steps movement. But after trying again and again, she managed to find her balance and learned how to use the right directional terms such as “forward” and “backward” instead of “go in front” and “go behind”.⠀
⠀
It can be difficult for parents to juggle between work from home and taking care of the kids. With MFS HBL kits, learning was fun and easy for Alyssa (even her elder brother joined her in the activity!). We are also grateful to the teachers for being so concerned to check in and monitor every children’s health condition either in MFS parent portal or WhatsApp daily.⠀
⠀
If you are seeking out a quality and holistic pre-school for your little one, sign up with NTUC First Campus’ My First Skool today (https://bit.ly/alyssagohjxmay20) to experience their joy of learning! #linkinbio⠀
