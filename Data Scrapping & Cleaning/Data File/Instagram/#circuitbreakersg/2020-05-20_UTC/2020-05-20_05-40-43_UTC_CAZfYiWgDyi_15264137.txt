This keyboard served us well for 22 years and finally RIP, after having worked happily with 2 CPU bosses, 4 monitor customers, many hard-disks and mouse team-mates. It was originally from a HP Pavilion pentium desktop PC running Windows 95 which 'kaput' after 11 years. Thereafter I self assembled our own i5 computer with mostly Asus components and kept using old keyboard, mouse and monitor. This desktop PC is now also into its 11th year, except for the Graphics card which was changed 2 years ago..... Now can continue transferring our blurays and CDs to our NAS mediaserver. 🙏🏻😅😇
