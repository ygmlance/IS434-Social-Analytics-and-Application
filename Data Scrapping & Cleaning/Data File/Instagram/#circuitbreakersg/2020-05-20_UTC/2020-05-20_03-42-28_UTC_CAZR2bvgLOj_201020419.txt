My pets! Every morning, the 9 of them will "greet" me and I will spend time watching them roam... Brought them home when they were still toddlers and they have since grown so big. Too big that I am worrying about overcrowding. They are "shy" too, hiding from "strangers". ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ #pet #petkoi #petfish #koifish #koipond #circuitbreakersg #singaporeðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬
