☆Heart Balloon☆
An introductory trial workshop for Flower of Crystal Art, Heart Balloon is a great experience if you are new to this beautiful flower blooming pastel art.

Glad to have Kimmie join me in this session where we ended up chatting alot about pastel art, sharing my pastel art loots 🤣 and answering questions on the system and curriculum of Flower of Crystal Art. I was also very touched when Kimmie dropped me a thank you message and showed appreciation to the care I put into packing every material that I courier over to my participants. Thank you!

Hope you had as much fun as I did,  Kimmie! Can't wait to see your Heart Balloons in different colours!
