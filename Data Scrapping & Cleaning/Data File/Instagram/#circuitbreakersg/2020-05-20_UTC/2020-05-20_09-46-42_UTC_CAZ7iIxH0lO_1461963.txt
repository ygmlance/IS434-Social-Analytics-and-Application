Day 44 of CB - Made mee siam for lunch. Totally underestimated the time I’ll need and ended up with lunch only at 2pm! Well at least I managed to still have my half hour yoga sesh this morning. The rempah was a pain to fry but I think I may have found a shortcut to the making of mee siam 🧐 Overall the gravy could have been more balanced with a bit more sugar but the in laws loved it and said they don’t have to buy from their fave stall in geylang East anymore. So it’s a pass I guess? #homecooked #circuitbreakersg #umamilicious
