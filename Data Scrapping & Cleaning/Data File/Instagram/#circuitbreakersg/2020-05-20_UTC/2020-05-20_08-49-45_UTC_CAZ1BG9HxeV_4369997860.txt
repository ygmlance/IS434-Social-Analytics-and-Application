Well, they say that news comes bunches. More unfortunate news with the government here in Singapore is not letting gyms open until at least JULY. With the gym not operating, and no international travel, things have certainly slowed down for us here. In other news, tune in tonight Wednesday 8PM Singapore time on @Wmaldives as I will go live for a tropical and fun workout 🌴💪🏽 It will be 4PM Dubai Time and 8AM eastern time in North America.
