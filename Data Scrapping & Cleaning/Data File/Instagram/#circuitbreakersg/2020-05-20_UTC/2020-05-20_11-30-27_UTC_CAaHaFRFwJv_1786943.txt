Was thinking of ways to use up the sour cream in my fridge, thought of sweet potato mash, googled for a recipe and came across @cookieandkate 's savory mashed potato recipe. ⁣
⁣
Her recipe uses chopped fresh parsley but I didn't have that so I replaced it with some dried parsley herbs. She also drizzles 1 teaspoon of EVOO on the mashed sweet potato but I didn't do this step. ⁣
⁣
Paired it with some lemon herb chicken breast and some fresh salad greens from @finestfoodsg
