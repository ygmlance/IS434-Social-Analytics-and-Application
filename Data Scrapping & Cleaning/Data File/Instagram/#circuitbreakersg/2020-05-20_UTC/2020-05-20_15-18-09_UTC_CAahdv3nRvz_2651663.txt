I put on 6kg over #Circuitbreakersg! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± Time to get my salad game on! Tonight's selection is a fusion soba salad with baby spinach and oak leaf lettuce, accompanied by yellow cherry tomatoes, seasoned jellyfish, and oyster mushrooms pan-fried with bacon bits, topped off with a sprinkling of assorted seeds and lightly drizzled with a beautiful lemon peanut sauce graciously provided by @oiramplease, which IMHO adds a dash of pure magic.
