CB Day 44 - With 49 years of experience cooking Hokkien mee, it has to be good right? Interesting yet delectable twist with sambal Lala hokkien mee and braised pork version (few others like Mala and sambal pork belly and chicken cutlet). Had the homely tasting curry chicken fm their neighbor stall which u can order through them too. Now “energized” to work! #hokkienmee #mianking1971 #stayhome #stayhomedelivery #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #comfortfood #fatdieme #yummy #yummyfood #yumyum #enjoythemoment #superyummy #food #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #foodstagram #sgfood #foodsg #foodblogsg #eatinginsingapore #sgfooddiary #sgfoodlover #sgfoodheaven #foodie #foodlovers #吃是福 #eatingisabliss #happyfood #thankgodforthefood stayhome #stayhomedelivery #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #comfortfood #fatdieme #yummy #yummyfood #yumyum #enjoythemoment #superyummy #food #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #foodstagram #sgfood #foodsg #foodblogsg #eatinginsingapore #sgfooddiary #sgfoodlover #sgfoodheaven #foodie #foodlovers #吃是福 #eatingisabliss #happyfood #thankgodforthefood
