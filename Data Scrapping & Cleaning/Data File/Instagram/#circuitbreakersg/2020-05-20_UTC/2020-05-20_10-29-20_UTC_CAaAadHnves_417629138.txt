South Australia’s Coonawarra wine region is home to some of Australia’s best Cabernet Sauvignon (and famed terra rossa soil!) and it’s here that the Redman family has been crafting wines since 1908. Redman Wines, established in 1966 and now with fourth generation winemaker Daniel Redman at the helm, is considered to be one of the pioneer wineries in the Coonawarra, producing award winning Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz. 🍷

The palate opens gracefully with dried red berry fruit, ripe plum, aniseed and black pepper. Subtle notes of vanilla and subtler of oak come through on the mid-palate, framed by soft, dusty tannins and leading to a tasty, medium finish. Time in the bottle has softened some of the fruit character and maybe the acidity, resulting in a drier and lighter-bodied style of Shiraz. There is plenty to enjoy here: good balance and structure and an elegant flavour profile that doesn’t bash you over the head like some South Australian examples. I’d probably say this is in its peak drinking window. Tasty stuff indeed, lovely in the cooler evenings. .
