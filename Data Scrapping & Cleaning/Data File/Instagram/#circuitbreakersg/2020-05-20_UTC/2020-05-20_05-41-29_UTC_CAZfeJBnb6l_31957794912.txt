Red braised pork belly #红烧肉. Meat is so tender that it melts in your mouth. Cooked some garlic stir fried greens n a dollop of home-made sambal belachan (new batch) to go along - neighbours gave the thumbs up 👍. #simplepleasures Got my mojo back last evening cooking dinner & I was just thinking how I could finally go out for some drinks soon n then I read the news 😞. It was already expected n totally essential. Nonetheless, i was pretty dispirited after that. Who feels the same?

A fuss-free under 30mins prep time that’s why I love anything braised Cos I just let it sit on the stove n that’s that. Good for lazy cooks like myself. Simply just need to watch the sauce level occasionally as it simmers that’s all. I think this sinful dish justified my 100 push ups 🤪. Really miss the physical social connection. .

How to: first, cook the pork belly with brown sugar to cameralise it n more umami actually n then throw in star anise, cinnamon, some ginger, shallots, garlic, szechuan peppercorns, dried chillis, seasoning which is contingent on your taste buds either more or less on dark or light soya sauce. bring to a boil n then simmer it for about an hour n u r set.
