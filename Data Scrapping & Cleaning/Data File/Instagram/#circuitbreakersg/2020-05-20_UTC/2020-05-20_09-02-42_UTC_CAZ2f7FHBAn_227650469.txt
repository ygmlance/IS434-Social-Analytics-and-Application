I love strolling around the neighbourhood. We passed by the First Botanic Garden on our way to the grocery. This “jalan-jalan” reminded me of the things we take for granted—breathing freely while outside (no masks), wiling away the hours in the park, even taking the bus without worries— and wishing we can have that all back again. ⭐️
