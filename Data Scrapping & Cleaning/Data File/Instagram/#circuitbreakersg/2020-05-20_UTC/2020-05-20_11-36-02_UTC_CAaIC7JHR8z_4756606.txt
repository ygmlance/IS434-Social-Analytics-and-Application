Day 44/56•Stayhome Dinner 
Simple but really satisfying dinner although the dishes colour look dull! 😅😅😅 Wong Bok meatballs soup, Green curry chicken & felt like eating Thai style claypot vermicelli & decided to use up the remaining @newmoonsg 's IQF Australian Abalones, just a quick simmer of 2 mins to keep the abalones tender texture ❤❤ not forgetting the hubb's fav tangy chilli dip!
