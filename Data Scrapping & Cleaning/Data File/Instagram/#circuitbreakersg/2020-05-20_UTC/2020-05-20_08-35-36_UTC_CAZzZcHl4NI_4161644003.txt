(Throwback) Day 43 of Circuit Breaker - Have fun with sea treasure hunt! Let’s’ hunt for SEA Animals! Look at her surprise face when she found out the animals from the water beads! Super love her every surprised look! Mama was very surprised when she said “TURTLE”! And she likes to put turtle inside her top, so funny 🤣

Guess how many sea animals we hided inside the small green pail with those water beads?

Ten 10!!! #sgbabygirl #circuitbreakersg
