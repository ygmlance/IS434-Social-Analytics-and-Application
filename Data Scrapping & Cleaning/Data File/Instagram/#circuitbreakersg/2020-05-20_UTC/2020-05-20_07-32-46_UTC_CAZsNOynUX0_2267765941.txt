A lot of people ask why use Bone-In Angus Beef Rib Steak; well hereâ€™s why:

Bone is a poor conductor of heat, it takes longer for bone to heat up! So when you grill steaks with bone-in, the meat that is touching the bone winds up being less cooked and therefore having a smoother (buttery) texture, which when eaten with connected meat that is slightly further away, you get a lovely flavour and mouthfeelðŸ˜‹ YUM.
