20th May #circuitbreakersg Day 44 - When I say I change 10 outfits before leaving the house, it ain't a lie. 90% of the time I end up in my 1st or 2nd choice. My vain ass always can't decide what look I wanna go for and I end up late hurhur. I took 3hrs to make this video so I hope you enjoy it ðŸ™ˆðŸŒš
