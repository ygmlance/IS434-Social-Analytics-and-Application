Aching back and arms.. I worry for tomorrow's additional workout! Today did #hasfit Tabata Style workout and it was tiring too.. I wore gloves and socks to prevent myself from slipping down and its been great. But I'm getting bruises from being clumsy.. My knee and my toe.. Raining at my place... Have a good day!
