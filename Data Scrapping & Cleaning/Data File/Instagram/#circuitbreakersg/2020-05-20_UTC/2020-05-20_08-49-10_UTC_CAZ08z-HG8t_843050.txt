With yesterday’s news of school reopening on 2 June, I’m just holding on to whatever days are left to spend with the kids. This May hols have been well-spent, cooking up a storm for the family, unpacking boxes from our recent move, and most of all, spending time with the kids playing, singing, reading, or just rolling around & talking in bed. I didn’t get to do all the things I’ve wanted to do with them, much as I would love to, but I think these are enough. There’s a new level of closeness and understanding between us; we’ve been through a few stormy days but many more days of sunshine. 
Once this #circuitbreakersg is over, I think we might miss the extended family time that we’ve had these 2 months. It’s been a strange but unique season that we’ve gone through together and will always remember. With our love tank filled up, I’m sure we can turbo ahead and conquer whatever lies ahead of us. 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 .
