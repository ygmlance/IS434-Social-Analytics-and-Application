Brunch today, was another attempt at Penang-style Char Kway Teow. Medium-sized prawns were fried in lard, when half cooked, minced garlic was added and sweat till fragrant. Kway Teow was thrown in, and a couple of dashes each of fish sauce and “Kicap Char Koay Teow” from Penang’s Heng Lee Sauce were added and the noodles stirred thoroughly over high heat. Beaten eggs were added, and when they were almost cooked, the noodles were stirred again. Bean sprouts, chives, sliced fishcake and lap cheong, or Chinese Sausage were added, and these were mixed well with the noodles. Dried shrimp chilli paste was then added, and everything was mixed well till ready. Tasty and satisfying! 😋 #penangcharkwayteow #penangfood #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
