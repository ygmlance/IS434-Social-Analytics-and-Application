When life gives you lemons, don’t just make lemonade, use them to make pound cakes! If you have always wanted to make your own cakes, you will enjoy baking these lemon chia seed pound cakes from scratch at home with our baking kit. ⠀
⠀
Our Lemon Chia Seed Pound Cake baking kit includes a step-by-step recipe card and quality ingredients that are perfectly weighed out and numbered. This set makes plenty of delish pound cakes for the family with no waste and less fuss and available to order online at www.bakeri.sg (link in bio).
⠀
On a side note, we’ve teamed up with @deedeedee13 to gift four families with $40 gift card each that can be redeemed at our online store. Head over to @deedeedee13 on Instagram for all the deets on how to enter the giveaway. Don’t miss out and good luck! ⠀
