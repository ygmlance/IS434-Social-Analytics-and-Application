Got my bread fix for the rest of #circuitbreakersg ✨💕 found this quaint bakery near my hood. Was trying to make sourdough for 2 weeks and gave up🤭😂 hence hunted down this sourdough-specialised bakery which surprisingly has a large range of choices of its small shop size 🥰 best of all their bakes changes every week with weekend specials✨
...
What I got:
1️⃣ purple wheat sourdough with candied orange ($12) 🍞 
2️⃣traditional baguette ($3.50) 🥖 
3️⃣bundle C - 2x croissants and 2x pain Au Chocolat ($13) 🥐
...
I wanted to get more off the shelves but omg I cant finish!😂 definitely gonna start chasing their weekly bakes at least once a month🤩 and I love that the sizes are huge hence considered pretty affordable for the high quality artisan standard of pastries👍✨ highly recommended to pre-order their specials! Stay safe and nom on till the end💪
