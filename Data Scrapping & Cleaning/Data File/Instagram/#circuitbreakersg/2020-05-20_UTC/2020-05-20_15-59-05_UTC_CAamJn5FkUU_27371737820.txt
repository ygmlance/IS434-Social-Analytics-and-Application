[Verdict: InTerrysting üëåüèª] Hit up a classic CBD lunch spot at Lunar Coffee Brewers before WFH and CB kicked in. If you‚Äôre working/ living near CBD, you can consider them for your lunch option.

Beef Steak Don ($17.50; pic 1). It can be rather decadent to have steak don for lunch but it‚Äôs something that you could consider to perk up your afternoon. Beef slices marinated in soy sauce cooked medium, an onsen egg, garnished with fried garlic and spring onion. I found the beef to be slightly chewy but nonetheless, I enjoyed it.

Mushroom Bacon Carbonara ($15.90; pic 2). This is the creamy variant of carbonara. Spaghetti was cooked al dente and it wasn‚Äôt too salty. It can be rather food coma inducing as evidenced by the copious amount of cream. But the texture of the sauce remained consistent and didn‚Äôt become lumpy as you start eating it.

Truffle Shoestring Fries ($8.50; pic 3). Nothing much to shout about but the use of truffle oil is evident. Truffle oil is a contentious ingredient among chefs but consumers love it.

Flat White ($4.50; pic 4). Lunar‚Äôs coffee shines as always. The beans are their house blend that‚Äôs sourced from 2 Degrees North Coffee Co. The flat white is easy to drink for those who aren‚Äôt the biggest fan of strong coffee. There‚Äôs a balanced mix of milk and espresso. It‚Äôs aromatic, nutty with hints of cocoa.

I like how they serve both filtered still and sparkling water if you dine in. Quite an uncommon sight in Singapore‚Äôs F&B outlets.
