My love @amileekang cooked teriyaki grilled chicken legs for dinner using our new “EuropAce 28L Microwave Oven with Convection and Grill”. They turned out to be beautifully-cooked and so yummy! 
You can bake, cook, heat and even rotisserie with this microwave oven by @europacesingapore. 
Can’t wait to enjoy all the delicious meals and pastries that Amilee will cook with it😍
