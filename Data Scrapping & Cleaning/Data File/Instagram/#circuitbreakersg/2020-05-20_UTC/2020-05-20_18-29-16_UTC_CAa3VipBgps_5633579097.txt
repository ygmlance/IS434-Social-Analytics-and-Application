20 May 2020 is World Bee Day.

Bees are important pollinators for our food crops; they provide us honey, and support jobs in the huge agriculture industry. Using their venom to create certain medicine, bees are sadly decreasing in numbers. Many bee species are presently endangered and once they are gone, we will see multiple ripple effects in our food ecosystems and lives.
