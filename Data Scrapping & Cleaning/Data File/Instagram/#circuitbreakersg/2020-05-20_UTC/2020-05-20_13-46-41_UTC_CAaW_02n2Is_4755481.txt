Lunch. Baked  #breadrolls last night. I thought I’d get this done in 2 hours but I think my #yeast is broken! Well it’s also I don’t remember how old. So it works but not as effectively. The #bread really needed to be proofed longer but it was late and I was sleepy. So they’re kind of small. Tasted ok thankfully.  But yeah I’m not the best #baker no.
