Dinner this evening, was the last bit of leftover Cabbage Rice from last Thursday, Stir-fried Bean Sprouts and Chye Sim, or Mustard Greens, and Beef Gulai, which is actually Beef Rendang before it dries up during its cooking process. I couldnâ€™t wait another hour, so ate it as a gulai, and will continue to cook it for another hour or so, into a rendang sometime down the road. Tasty and satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #cabbagerice #stirfriedbeansproutswithchyesim #beefgulai #nowastemeal #reheatedleftovers #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
