Transition to a 'new normal' after circuit breaker: Can I go back to normal again? ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Since yesterday all my social media and messages are flooded with the news on the transition on the end of circuit breaker. I took the early morning to digest the news. By the word "digest", I mean understanding the measures, background, outlook and mentally think through how it will affects me. Woah, I was actually sad seriously. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
I don't know how long I am really able to stay at home. I longed for the days I can travel freely, shop freely, spontaneously meet my family and friends for coffee and cakes. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
üòñ Yes, my day started lousy actually. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Then this morning, someone in the meeting mentioned about it is okay to feel lousy on some days. What's important is to acknowledge we have good and bad days. The question is do you have more happy or lousy days? And when you have a lousy day, what do you DO to get out of it? ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
üí•Exactly right?! It takes conscious effort to get ourselves out of this negative spiral trap. ‚†Ä
This afternoon, I took some time off from my  schedule and have a long long longgggg shower. I came out all refreshed! I think Ive managed to wash away my bad vibes. ‚úåÔ∏è‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Thanks for read this post till here. Do you have your lousy days too? Share with me what do you do to get out of it? ‚†Ä
