It’s been so long since I last met up with any friend for a meal and catchup. A friend used to say “It’s not about the food, it’s about the people we are eating with.”. This was spoken 10 years ago but somehow the sentence seems to be stuck in my head. It has been a crazily busy month at home. I think it is about time that I’m missing socialising with friends! Anyone missing your friends too?
