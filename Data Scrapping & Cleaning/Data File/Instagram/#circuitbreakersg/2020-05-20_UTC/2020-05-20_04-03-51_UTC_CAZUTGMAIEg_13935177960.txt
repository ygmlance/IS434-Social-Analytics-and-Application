Bored of same taste? King of Thai food #padthainoodles we did online cooking with our Thai friend who kindly walked us through. Tamarind sauce which brings the authentic twist to the taste was super easy to make if you can get hold of #tamarind soak it in hot water, squeeze out the juice and mix with fish sauce and sugar. Ah sweet and sour taste! #padthai is our new family favourite.#padthainoodles #familycooking #circuitbreakersg #homecooking #cookingwithkids #asianfood #タイ料理#バッタイ
