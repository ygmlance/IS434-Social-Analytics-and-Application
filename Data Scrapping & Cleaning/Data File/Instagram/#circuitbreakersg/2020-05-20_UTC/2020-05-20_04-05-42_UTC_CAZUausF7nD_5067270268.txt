YIN YANG PALMS (SOMATIC) ⠀
Intention in how you move plays a huge role in energy based movement modalities like qigong, because this affects our attention. This practice takes inspiration from the practice of feeling the qi, or energy from one's palms in qigong, and the spirals in our body. ⠀
⠀
TIPS: ⠀
1. Visualize your palms, as if they're holding something delicate, tender, like a baby or cloud matter. Let them alternate, one facing up and the other facing down ⠀
2. You can also visualize them following a path of ∞ inifity⠀
3. Gently add in the spirals of the elbows, shoulders, and let the movement spread to the rest of your lower body.
