There are good days + bad days, highs + lows

Going through Circuit Breaker as a FTWM who is also heavily pregnant is tough. Some days I feel like a supermom who’s got everything under control, but on most days I don’t - always losing my patience and blasting off at Julius almost everyday to get him to brush his teeth, do his work or take his meals. Yet for Livia, because she’s younger, I will give in easily to her demands of Cocomelon so that I can have some peace working and she will take her meals.

Being pregnant and working is not an excuse to lose my patience so easily I know but it just seems like the easier way out that I conveniently go for.

And last night was a low night. I turned off the tv in a bid to get him to take his dinner and he reached his tipping point, screaming like a wild animal and shouted nasty things at me.

It made me realise I haven’t been listening and respecting him as an individual all these while, but only making use of threats and authority to get him to do his work and the things I wanted him to do. To the extent that he has lost interest and confidence to do some things even.

This is a moment that I’m totally not proud of, but would like to document it nonetheless as a reminder of who I shouldn’t be become as a parent.

Guess I have slightly less than 2 weeks to make up for the wrong that I’ve done the past 1.5 months, especially before Xiao K3 comes and I neglect him once again.
