Day 44 of circuit breaker (20/5/2020).
.
Started the day with listening to short sermons, listen to P&W songs, settled some course admin issues, business discussion and churchwide bible study. .

Thankful for mom's homecook dinner as I was a little lazy to cook any food today😂😋.
Australian pumpkin, egg tofu, sliced potatoes with onions and minced meat. 🧅🥩🥔🍚🍛
.
Blessed even with the simplicity of life! 🙏💖
