#Circuitbreakersg Day 44
.
I have a sweet tooth and no one can stop me
.
Finally got to try the brownie, blueberry & chocolate muffin and double chocolate muffin from @bakesnbites_old_airport_road
.
I was not disappointed. I like that they're not too sweet
.
Certainly worth going back a second time for. There's no better time to #supportlocal (and fatten the curve) ðŸ˜‚
