#circuitbreakersg has given me more time on my hands - to repeat dishes just to practice a little more precision and attention to detail. With a couple of beautiful steaks (Denver or Zabuton, in this case), this is an easy dish to make tasty. But taking a few more moments to measure the amount water for cooking, and paying attention to tell-tale signs to lower the fire, ensured I got the perfect rice texture - things I usually rush through just to get it done.  I also spent more time making this dish pretty - a few extra minutes obsessing over the size of the cubes of beef and asparagus and the shreds of leek garnish.  Things that may come easily for better cooks, perhaps.  But for impatient me, it is a little achievement.
(And when the family devours it entirely even though I increased the portions, that is truly gratifying)
