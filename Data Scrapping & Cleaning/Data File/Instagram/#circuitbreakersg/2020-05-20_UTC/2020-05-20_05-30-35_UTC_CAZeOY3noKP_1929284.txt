CB Day 44 of 56.  Today’s homecooked lunch is just brownish, as I cooked Braised Mushroom Wholegrain Bee Tai Mak with carrots and chicken slices.  A healthier “ zhi cha” style.  Hahaha. 
Nothing fanciful for lunch today as I have to schedule two candidates to take some technical test online. At least I did fulfill my task to cook a different dish.
