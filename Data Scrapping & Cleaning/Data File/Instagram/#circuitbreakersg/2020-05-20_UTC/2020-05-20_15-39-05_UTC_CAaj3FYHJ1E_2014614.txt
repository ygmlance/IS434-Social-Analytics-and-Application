If you love the nutty fragrance of black sesame, you won’t want to miss their 𝘢𝘭𝘭-𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝐆𝐨𝐦𝐚 series:⁣⁣

I love the 𝐆𝐨𝐦𝐚 𝐏𝐞𝐛𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐆𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐮! Rich, nutty and very fragrant! I shared half the gateau – albeit unwillingly – with my momma and she loves it too! She kept saying 我很飽 but still ate half! 😏⁣
⁣
I guess their matcha latte needs no introduction as it’s easily one of the best in 🇸🇬! I kid you not~ Full-bodied yet smooth on the palate! The new 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐆𝐨𝐦𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞 is just as good with a subtle hint of nuttiness. However, if you were to ask me, my top choice would still be their 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞! It has been my go-to order ever since I was introduced to it by Hvala’s owner! ⁣
⁣
📣𝐏𝐒𝐀: You prolly need some luck if you wanna get your hands on the goma pebble gateau as it’s not available for order via their online ordering site (hvala.com.sg/pages/cb-delivery). Just select Goma Mont Noir and input “𝐆𝐎𝐌𝐀 𝐆𝐎𝐌𝐀” under the special request box when placing your order! The folks at #HvalaSG will then randomly pick a few lucky ones and 𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 turn your goma tart to pebble! 😍⁣⁣
