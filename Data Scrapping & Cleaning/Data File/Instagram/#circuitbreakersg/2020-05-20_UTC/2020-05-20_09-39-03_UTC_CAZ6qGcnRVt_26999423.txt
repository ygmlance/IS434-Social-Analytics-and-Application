"I hated being so reactive to governing rules and the uncertainty you brought, COVID-19. I decided to focus more of my time and energy in areas I had more control of; where I could still be of use." Dear Covid-19 is a memory project to shed light on everyday life when Singapore came to a standstill as everyone stayed home. How we respond can define us as an individual, as a community and as a nation. Big thanks to DSTNCT for putting this together.
