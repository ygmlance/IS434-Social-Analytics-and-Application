we did it :) 100 packets of porridge to Ren Ci Nursing Home today!

Many thanks to the lovely chefs (my parents and shushu who have been so supportive of the idea). Also thank you to kind donors Jason Chong and Edwin Sim.

Not forgetting of course Rena from Ren Ci!

Without all your help, we wouldn't make it. A million thanks everyone!! 谢谢❤️ #porridge
