Ë±ö‰∏º ‚à• Butadon

A simple yet tasty Japanese bowl if you need to fix your cravings. I use pork but here but can be replaced by beef.

Ingredients: frozen pork belly sukiyaki, spring onion, onion, egg üìùTypically sauce can be made by cooking sake: mirin: soya sauce in 1:1:1, but I will use the sake to marinate the pork belly first for 30 minutes, and use mirin:soya sauce for later.
üìùboil water to make onsen egg. Keep onsen egg in boiled water for 10 minutes. Soak in ice water after that.

‚ù∂ Slice onion. Heat up oil and fried onion to slightly brownish
‚ù∑ Add 30ml:30ml mirin:soya sauce to onion and bring it to boil
‚ù∏ Add marinated pork belly and continue to boil. Pork belly cooked quite fast so it will take about 10 to 15 minutes. You can keep in the lowest fire for slightly longer until you want to serve it
‚ùπ Ready to serve by adding slice spring onion and onsen egg ‚ö†Ô∏èSpring onion is a real need for Butadon. I think I miss Yoshinoya Japan more and more!
