Pete La Roca - Basra, 1965. From the moment the needle hits the wax this record sizzles. Pete The Rock with his manic cymbal work starts us off on Malaguena, Joe Henderson joins like he is in a trance. The quartet with Steve Kuhn and Steve Swallow keeps this frantic pace, keeps you focused. This is an edgey record. You sit up to listen. If you love drums like I do, this is a sonic feast. Sadly, this was The Rockâ€™s only album as lead for Blue Note. He went on to be a lawyer to pay the bills. Basra was one of my prized Blue Notes. Had a 1984 Japanese reissue and it was one of the more difficult titles to source for. Then the 80th series came along and wow it blew me away! Grab a copy and play it loud!
