Day 44 of #circuitbreakersg (or should we start counting down to 1 Jun?). During this time, it is easy to relax, chill and proscrastinate. So, I made a ‘poster’ to remind myself to rise and shine and get things done even though I am still in my PJs with messy hair. 😊 Poster is made with one-sided printed paper. I painted the blank side and did some cut and paste. ♻️📃🖌✂️♻️
