SUPINE SUBLIME⠀
Here's a supine sequence with hip flexion, spinal twists and stretch for your lower back and glutes that you can include to wind down before savasana. It's as important as  savasana itself, so don't skip it! Your body will thank you afterwards. ⠀
⠀
1. Wind relieving pose →⠀
2. Reclined single leg twist → both legs → lying on side⠀
3. Figure of 4 stretch → Figure of 4 twist ⠀
After this you can continue with with happy baby,  cosmic egg moving the spine into flexion, bananasana or any other movement/shape that helps you ease better into savasana.
