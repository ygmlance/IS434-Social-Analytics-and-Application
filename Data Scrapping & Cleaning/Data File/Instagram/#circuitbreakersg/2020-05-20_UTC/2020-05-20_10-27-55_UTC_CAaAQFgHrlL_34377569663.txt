Some of our friends at the shelter had just completed colouring these beautiful Nonya Manis the Peranakan paper doll on the colouring sheets from Moses Sia. Enjoy this first batch from the work that we received, with more coming up soon!

Additionally, we also received some materials and games from Moses! Thank you!
