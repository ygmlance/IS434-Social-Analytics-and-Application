Attempted my first ever Bikram yoga class on Sunday, led virtually by yoga expert @_tigerjilly ðŸ™Œ
.
I think this form of yoga is supposed to be practiced "hot" style â€“ but it's hot enough on this sunny island year-round, so a regular indoor environment was sweltering enough for me ðŸ˜‚
.
Grateful for Jill encouraging us through the many poses safely, a challenging task when you have students of differing experience levels (n00b = me) and no way to reach through the screen for physical correction .
My fav pose? "Dead tree" by the end of the class ðŸ˜¬ðŸŒ´
