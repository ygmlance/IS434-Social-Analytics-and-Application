𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗶 𝗥𝗮𝘆𝗮 is coming! Here is a little activity for little Kizzos to do at home - making a Ketupat Raya Card! Use the chance to also introduce the festival so they can learn and create at the same time! With simple materials at home, follow the video and you can do it too! 🤩 Once you are done, take a photo, tag us and hashtag #stayhomewithkiztopia ! Have fun! ❤️
