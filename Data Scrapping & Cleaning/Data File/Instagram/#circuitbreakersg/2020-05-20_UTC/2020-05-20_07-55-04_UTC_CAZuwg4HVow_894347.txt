Day 44 : Throw back 2011. This wedding was very different from others and made it so memorable. She loves to dance and decided to have a group dancing before her first march-in. I was requested to help her change dress and hairstyle within 5 mins after the dance and before the 1st March-in. I really enjoyed the performance and manage to transform her on time 😁
