Our spicy lunch with oven-grilled chicken in Kicap Manis sauce, stewed Chayote, a lovely sunny side up egg and a fiery Sambal Belachan. Burp!! 🤩😋⁣
⁣
For the chicken, marinate fresh boneless chicken leg with sambal, kicap manis, minced garlic, minced red onion and some soy sauce. Oven-grill the chicken at 240 ℃ for 10 mins. Yum! 😍
