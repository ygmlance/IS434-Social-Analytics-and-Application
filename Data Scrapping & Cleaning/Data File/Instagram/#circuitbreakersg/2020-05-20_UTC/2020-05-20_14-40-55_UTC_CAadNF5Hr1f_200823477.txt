Yuzu miso from @hinodeshotengai is a natural Japanese Yuzu-flavored Miso. Delightfully refreshing, perfect for Salmon soup. It's so easy to add to the soup. (The miso paste I saw from supermarket need to whisk into a little hot water to get the clumps out)

I had tried 2 different method for salmon fish soup. 🐟 For the first salmon soup, I left the salmon fish bone boiling together with all the vegetables and of course I use a fine mesh, sieved any fish bones from the soup for my daughter. I managed to get milky soup that day. 🐟

Swipe ⬅️ - The second salmon soup, I sieved out the bones from the soup, added vegetables and salmon fish in to cook. However, the key to any good fish soup is on how you flavor the broth. 
Thanks @hinodeshotengai for sending these over!
