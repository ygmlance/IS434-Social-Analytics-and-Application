That day when A left the house for the first time since cb
.
#theAteamSim wanted to tag along a coffee delivery to @louienag their kindy teacher
.
Glad to see her well and the kids couldnâ€™t stop reminiscing about school days spent with her
.
To A, shedding tears was a big part of kindy due to insecurities. Boom loves kindy days as he woke up late and took long baths
