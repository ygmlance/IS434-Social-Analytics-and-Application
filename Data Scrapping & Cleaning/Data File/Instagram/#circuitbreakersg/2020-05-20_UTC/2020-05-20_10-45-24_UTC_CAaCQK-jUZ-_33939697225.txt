~ Salmon en Papillote ~ For the past year, I have mostly been adding salmon into the Simlets' diet the no frills way. I think it's time to explore different versions of cooking this versatile fish. Trying salmon on parchment paper for the first time with scallions, sweet paparika, butter and orange. The smell is so heavenly. Bon Appetit! #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #salmon #bakedsalmon #frenchfood #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
