Things to do with the kids #61

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Oh God, it's raining." "What's wrong with that?" "I can't go outside." "Titus, you're not supposed to go outside, unless it's for exercise or essentials." "Vanilla, it's essential I go outside." "No, Titus, there's a difference between going out to procure essentials and it being essential that you go outside." "Same difference, Vanilla Bean. It's essential I go and sit on the wall and do the essential of giving people without masks a #witheringlook." "Titus, your standard look is withering. You don't need to go outside for that." "But it's essential." "So, go out, if you must." "Vanilla, I can't. My bum will get wet. I hate having a wet bum." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
