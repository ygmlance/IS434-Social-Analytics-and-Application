CB DAY 45 -

Today I had to focus on Isabel a lot more because at 21 weeks old, she's actually dropped to 2 naps today. A few days ago she was already showing signs, but I didn't believe because 2 naps are off the standard charts. 
I'm glad I had my husband to discuss with. And with his encouragement, we took the leap and went to try it today. Adjusted her AWT to 2.45hr, and allowed her to wake organically. Previously we woke her at the mark we wanted her to. Today, we followed her cues. And true enough, she took 1hr for her first nap, 2.30hr for the 2nd and last nap. At 7pm she's already sleeping! Even better for us actually.

Thank God for this amazing baby doll. ðŸ’•

So no extra class for Jo today! He had fun playing at the waterplay this afternoon.
