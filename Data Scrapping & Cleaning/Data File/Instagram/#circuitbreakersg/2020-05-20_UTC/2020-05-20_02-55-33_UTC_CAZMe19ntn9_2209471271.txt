Took this shot of Funan in the early days of CB (had appointments nearby and zoomed in to get a drink). It was quite calming yet surreal to walk around the empty mall... while I was enjoying the experience, the PA system was telling us to quickly buy whatever we need and head home, and not hang around ðŸ˜„

Still prefer malls to be bustling with some crowd though!
