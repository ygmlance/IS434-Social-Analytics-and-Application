What's your survival kit during this home isolation period? Leave me your faves in the comments below. Here are my top 5 essentials that have been keeping me sane and creative indoors. (Swipe left for the list) #ChineyMoney Errryday! 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create: I ordered this backdrop off the internet to shoot the lyric video I just dropped üé•bit.ly/ttdlyrics and other content created to support friends (especially ones in FnB businesses). I pulled my Sony RX-100M3 out of retirement. Even though it's an older model, it improves the quality of IG Stories and posts, picks up low light and colour beautifully and the selfie mode makes it super easy to use in isolation. I'm recording an EP at my work desk, then turning around ready to shoot the music video! .

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exercise: I'm staying active with online Dancehall Classes direct from Jamaica with @orvillexpressionz @shellyxpressionz and gettin' busy shadow boxing in between. (For more info on the online dancehall classes DM @yencaballero seriously they are the best vibes and leave you sweating!) .
.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Selfcare: For someone that is always on the road, touring and travelling, staying home everyday has actually been a huge luxury for me.  Naturally I'm concocting #FarEastEmpress home spas with @Shibusa.atelier lavender oatmeal sea salt face scrub (ps. made by Attagirl's @akasounds) & @cocoil_bali Rose Oil.  The combo leaves me smelling like a beach vacation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ In the Kitchen: End of last year I launched my own 100% all natural Jamaican Jerk Sauce @sukasukasauce which I'm developing as a product to share the music of SE Asian artists. When #CircuitbreakerSG happened, people started cheffing at home, millennials started learning to cook, and I sold out of my supply in 1 week! I've been developing recipes to add to the website for everyone and keeping the vibes UP with Jamaican Jerk flavours in lockdown. (These #SukaSukaSauce Arepas by @haydee_harford). .

5Ô∏è‚É£ Puppy Love: I taught #Zendog how to give pounds. She's a G. .
