Succulent / Cactus.
Watercolour on Paper.
•
“She was like a cactus, beautiful but never letting anyone get too close.” 🌵
•
Investing my time on work and the things that make me a better artist and a grateful soul instead of focusing on things I have no control over. Revamped my workspace and this was one of the pieces I put up on my wall with my favourite tones. Forever a cactus girl. x
