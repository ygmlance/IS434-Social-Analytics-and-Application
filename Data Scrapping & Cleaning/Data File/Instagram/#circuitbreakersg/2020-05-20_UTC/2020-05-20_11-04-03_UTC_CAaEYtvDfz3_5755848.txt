Splash away!! ðŸ’¦ Waterplay at the balcony! The weather have been extremely humid and I couldnâ€™t be more thrilled when our unicorn waterplay table had finally arrived! I knew I had to create new entertainment when the #circuitbreakersg news was out... I was just prepping the usual toys and worksheets until I saw @ourpetithomesg hosting a preorder for this back in early April. I wanted to put up a inflatable pool but a pity it doesnâ€™t fit in the living room nor balcony so yay to a #waterplay table for a fun alternative! #funtime #motherhood #toddlerlife #summer #sgkids #sgmummy #igsg #instadaily #stayhome
