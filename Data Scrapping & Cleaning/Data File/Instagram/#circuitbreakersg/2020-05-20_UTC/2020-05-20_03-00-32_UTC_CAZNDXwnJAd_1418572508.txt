The Singapore government just announced that it will safely reopen the economy in 3 phases (safely reopening, safe transition, and new normal phases) after CB ends on June 1. In my case as well as for a lot of people here, it looks like phase 1 which will last for at least another 4 weeks will still be quite the same as the current situation, where we still cannot meet friends, go back to the office, or go to the gym to name a few. Only critical workers and industries who need to be in the office are allowed. This is definitely disheartening news for many, but remain strong, positive and safe always. What helps me are reflecting on people and things I am grateful for now, and trying to make the best of the situation. If staying home a little longer sounds boring and uneventful, make it exciting! You’ll be surprised. Stay safe everyone! •
