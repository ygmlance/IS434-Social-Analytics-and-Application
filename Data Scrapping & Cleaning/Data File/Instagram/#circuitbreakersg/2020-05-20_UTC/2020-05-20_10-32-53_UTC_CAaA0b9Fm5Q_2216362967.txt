Kombucha~ â€¢ iâ€™m a tea lover
.
I had to try this when I learnt that Kombucha is fermented TEA by a symbiotic culture of bacteria & yeasts.

Upon primary research, Kombucha is a functional beverage that contains probiotics and antioxidants, to name a few of its health benefits. That explains itâ€™s hefty price tag. But be forewarned of over-consuming it, as it can be high in calories and sugar, and may contain trace amounts of alcohol.

The first thing that came to mind when I took a sip was â€˜Ciderâ€™! Fizzy, sweet, with fruity notes. Where is my tea note? No taste of tea, or fragrance.. ðŸ¤”Maybe I should try a few more brands before concluding.
