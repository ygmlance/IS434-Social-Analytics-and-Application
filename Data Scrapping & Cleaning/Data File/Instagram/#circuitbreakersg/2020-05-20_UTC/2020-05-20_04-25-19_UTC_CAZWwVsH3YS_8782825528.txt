Yesterday my daughter kept breaking out in tears over no apparent reason. And as I put her to bed she blurted out, “I hate my life during this virus.” I know baby, me too. .
We are being watchful over her moods and trying our best to do things to keep the atmosphere at home light and fun. 
Being in lockdown has it’s lighter moments too though and they come unexpectedly like a surprise gift. We are grabbing at them and making sure we enjoy them, laugh at the bloopers, savour the coffee, breathe in the crisp morning air... do all we can to appreciate the beauty that’s still around us and free.
