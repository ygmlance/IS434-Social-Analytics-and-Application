Because of the #circuitbreakersg, everyone has been staying home and #birthday celebrations are confined within the household. Therefore, there were an increase in smaller cakes.

This #cake was ordered by my neighbor. She has been ordering cakes for her boy for 3 years already. But this time, the cake was for her hubby. ðŸ˜€

The cake was made with #lemonsponge filled with #homemade #raspberrycompote and #lemoncurd, frosted with #buttercream. (#lemon for the daddy, #raspberry for the son and mummy got to choose the design ðŸ˜‚) #joyyskitchen #homemade #homebaker #homebaked #sgcake #sgbakes #cakesofinstagram #sghomebaker #mumtrepreneur #sgmumtrepreneur  #supportlocal #customizedcake #lemonraspberry #lemonraspberrycake
