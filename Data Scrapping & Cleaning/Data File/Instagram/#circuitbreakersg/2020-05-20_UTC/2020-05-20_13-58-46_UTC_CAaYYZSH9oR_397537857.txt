#CircuitBreakerSG D-44【 Recipe 】

Cantonese steamed fish is usually served as one of the courses in a traditional Chinese wedding banquet. It is also a dish that I love to prepare for my family and I'm sharing the recipe here. Hope you'll enjoy as much as us.

Ingredients
500g-600g Live Hybrid (Longhu) Grouper 
5 Ginger slices
1 stalk Spring Onion, sectioned
2 tbsp Cooking Oil
Coriander

Sauce
2 inch Ginger, julienned
1 Shallot, sliced
1 clove Garlic, minced
1 stalk Spring Onion, julienned
2 tbsp Soya Sauce
0.5 tsp Sesame Oil
0.5 tsp Sugar
150ml Water

Method
1. Clean and dab dry the fish. Marinate with some salt and place over ginger slices on a steaming dish.
2. Bring water in the steamer to a boil before placing the fish on the steaming tray. Let it steam for around 10-12 mins.
3. In the meantime, prepare the sauce. Mix soya sauce, sesame oil, sugar & water. Heat up some oil, sauté ginger, shallot & garlic until fragrant. Add spring onion & the sauce. Bring to a boil and dish up.
4. Once the fish is cooked, discard all the liquid collected on the steaming dish. Place julienned ginger & spring onion on the fish.
5. Heat up cooking oil until smokey hot. Drizzle the oil on the ginger & spring onion. Beware of the sizzling sound. Drizzle the sauce at the side of the fish. 
6. Garnish with fresh coriander and serve immediately.

Hybrid Grouper (Long Hu) from @ApolloMarineSeafood is a cross breed fish between giant and tiger grouper. It is a high protein fish. Without the use of antibiotics and growth hormones, this fish is popular among gourmets because of its mildly sweet taste and firm texture.
