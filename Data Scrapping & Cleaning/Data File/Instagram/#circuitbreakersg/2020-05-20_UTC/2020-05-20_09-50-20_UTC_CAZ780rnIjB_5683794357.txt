Learning Mandarin can be really fun and engaging if the right materials are used ‚ù§Ô∏è

This Chinese puzzle is so engaging for Gerroy!!! Just a few times practices, he can recognise slightly more than half of the Chinese words. That‚Äôs the power of learning by doingüòÖ 
Gerroy always loves doing puzzles, and this Chinese puzzles kept him very occupied as he keeps on doing it again and again, like a form of addiction. 
Thanks @rosleow for such meaningful gift for Gerroy! If you are interested, this puzzle can be purchased from @underthemoonlight.sg and help your child to be engaged in learning Chinese. #gerroyow #5yearsold #chinesepuzzles #stayhomeactivities #circuitbreakersg #may2020
