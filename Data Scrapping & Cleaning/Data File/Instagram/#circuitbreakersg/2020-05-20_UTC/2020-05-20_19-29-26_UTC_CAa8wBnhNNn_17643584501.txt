Since we are staying home.. we baked our own Hari Raya cookies.. HUGE respect for all the #homebasebakers .. not sure how u guys can do this all the time... not easy and definitely a lot of effort for all the homemade cookies because this is not machine made cookies... Just like ours, we handmade all the furniture from scratch! Salute #homebasebakers We promise, We will buy more and #supportlocalbusiness next year for Raya! No questions will be asked! Heeee... Anyway, our cookies turn out perfect for our taste buds! We are so proud of ourselves and so so happy! ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§ûüèº PS: We don‚Äôt sell the cookies, but we do sell the lovely Trays! YOU can custom made yours after this circuit breaker! Pm us for more details! 
Selamat Hari Raya to our fabulous family, friends & customers!  #supportsmallbusiness #supportlocal #homebasedbaker #sghomebase #sghomebased #homebase #sghome #sghomecooking #sghomecook #sghomebaker #homebasedbusinesses #homebasedsg #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #hariraya #harirayacookies #harirayafood #harirayacollection #hariraya2020 #harirayaaidilfitri2020
