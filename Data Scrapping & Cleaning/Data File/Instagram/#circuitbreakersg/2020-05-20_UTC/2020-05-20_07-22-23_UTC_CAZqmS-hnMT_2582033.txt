I never cook Lemang for Eid however , I usually will cook ketupat pulut as you all know from my yearly posts - ‘food for Eid’ over the years . During this pandemic, it’s seems that ‘ketupat leaves’ will be hard to get .. so I tested and cooked Lemang using moulds that I have purchased few years back with the intention to cook mini Lontong rolls. Record breaking year 2020 , these moulds are out from the cupboard for good use to cook my Modern Lemang for Eid !
