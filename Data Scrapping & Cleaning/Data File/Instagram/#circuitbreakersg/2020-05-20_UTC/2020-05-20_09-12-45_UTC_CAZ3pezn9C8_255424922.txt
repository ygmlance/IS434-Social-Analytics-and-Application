I love using Lightful C Tinted Primer because it is suitable for all skin types. It acts as both a protection and primer. It has rosy tint that gives an instant lift to the skin making especially dull skin looks brighter and more healthier. It‚Äôs lightweight texture be used on its own, with or without makeup !
