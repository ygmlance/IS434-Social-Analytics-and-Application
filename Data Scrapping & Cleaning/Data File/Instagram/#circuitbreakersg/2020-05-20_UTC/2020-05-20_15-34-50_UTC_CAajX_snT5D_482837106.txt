I was craving for #siobak since the start of #circuitbreakersg, so many occasions I hesitated ordering because what if the siobak came not crispy or you know that super porky taste? Will need to thank my other half's boss for delivering this damn good platter of meat from @siobaksg, they delivered man! The crackling, the meat & the chilli totally on point! Super satisfied having this for lunch and dinner.
