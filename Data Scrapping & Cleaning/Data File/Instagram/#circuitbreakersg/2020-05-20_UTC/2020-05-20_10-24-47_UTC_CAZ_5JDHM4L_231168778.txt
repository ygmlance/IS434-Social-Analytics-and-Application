Boy-boy found more of my old hats. His head is the right size!

I’ve started on a new doll. I watched a Arne & Carlos YouTube video and thought I could knit along. It’s knitted in the round so I believe I can handle it. I can’t find any written pattern on the doll so hopefully they don’t leave out crucial parts or I’ll be so mad. The doll is going to be larger than Grace based on the size of the feet alone.
