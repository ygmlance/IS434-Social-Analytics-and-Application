Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 44:
I often order this dish at the Japanese restaurant near my workplace as it consists of my favourite ingredients - eggplant & miso. When I found this miso pork and eggplant recipe by @justonecookbook , I knew I had to try it!

Ended up overcooking the eggplants as I forgot to lower the flame when I turned around to wash the dishes ðŸ˜… Despite my boo-boo, the dish tasted great ðŸ˜‹ Will pay attention to theðŸ”¥next time!
