To make the most out of the Circuit Breaker, we decide to use the time to potty train the baby doll.

After 40 ish days (I’ve honestly lost count), I’m happy to announce that Baby Xaxa is pretty much DIAPER FREE! 🎉

I say ‘pretty much’ coz other than sleeping and the occasional times where she’ll insist on poopoo-Ing in a diaper 🤷🏼‍♀️, but most of her waking moments she’s in undies that she’s way outgrown.

This has got me scouring the supermarkets and online desperately to find more at this time... halpss! 😅 📸:@tinytoddsg
