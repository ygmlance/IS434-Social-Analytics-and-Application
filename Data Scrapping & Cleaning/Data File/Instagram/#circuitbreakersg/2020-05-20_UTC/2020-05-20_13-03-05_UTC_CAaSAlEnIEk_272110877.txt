Day 42. Our bio clocks has tuned in  to wake up at 6.45am since circuit breaker started. So lucky to catch sunrise intime.  Lunch - Mr. prepared a Teo chew dessert, yam paste (Orh Nee) with steamed pumpkin as the topping. The elders at home cheered at receiving their packed share. Dinner - pork steak with parmesan and sage butter. Topping is grilled cola bacon and veggie. Tomorrow we have to take something light. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #homecookedmeal #realfood #cookingisfun #instadaily
