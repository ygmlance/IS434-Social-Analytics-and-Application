20 MAY 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 44

Day 44 - #circuitbreakersg
🎨
So... I did something that I NEVER did before.....participated in a colouring contest.
😆
I happened to see this colouring contest from The Straits Times and Prudential and decided to give it a try.
😅
I love the artwork and wanted it to have a rainbow gradient to bring hope and positivity as we fight covid19. Took me hours to complete this!
