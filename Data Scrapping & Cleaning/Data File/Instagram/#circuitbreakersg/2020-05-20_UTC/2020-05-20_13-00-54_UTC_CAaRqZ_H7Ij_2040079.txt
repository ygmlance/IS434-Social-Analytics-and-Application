Just as WoonHung Natural Collection aims to withstand the test of time, I hope what is penned here remains relevant, when I reflect on this instagram years from now.⁠

More than beautiful images to conjure your imagination, I wanted to steer WoonHung into a space that is larger than jewellery made from natural materials, or an avenue on natural materials. ⁠

Because of this unusual hibernation, I've been receiving enquiries and interviews from editorials and publications. The questions do not deviate far and I can understand why. Because we face the same perpetual issues and everyone is trying to make sense out from senseless noise surrounding us. What does it take to be a sustainable-lead company? Only when we are armed with the right information, we can then make informed decisions to who we want to align with.⁠

On another note, #circuitbreakersg is extended again for non-essential businesses. You have no idea how happy that makes me. I take this as God-given time, to share some thoughts and later at www.woonhung.co's journal. Its been so quiet over there.⁠
⁠.⁠
In time to come, I would like to expound. And revisit Cebu with my camera and show you the beauty of handmade in the land of handmade. And more so, to express the different kinds of craft it takes to make one piece of jewellery, the people behind the making and the communities involved. ⁠

Sometimes, we forget, we are actually sitting on a pot of gold.⁠
