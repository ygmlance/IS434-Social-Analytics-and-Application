Was feeling a little under the weather today after work. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Who knows if it was paranoia causing an itchy throat or just realising that our #circuitbreakersg will only gradually phase out and it might be a long while before I can see my friends again. Genuinely can't wait to give some of them - yes looking at you @risha_malhotra - a HUGE hug. .
.
So I made myself a hot cup of everything that rhymed with #recovery: ‚û°Ô∏è
.
Spoonful of honey (...makes the medicine go down üéµ)
Slice of lemon
Pinch of turmeric
2 cloves
Mixed with hot water
.
.
ü§ûmy itchy throat goes away. Moving on to the #dormitories tomorrow to help assess #Covid-19 patients and triage who needs a hospital admission.
