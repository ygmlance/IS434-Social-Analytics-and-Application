The moonlight portion of my moonlight hor fun from Kah Soh didn’t survive the delivery but this is just as tasty! The wok hei on it was damn shiok and that is really all you need for a great meal.
And I ordered a small portion but it was so much that I *almost* couldn’t finish it.
If you see me and I’m back to my pre-Keto delectability, I blame all the carbs!
