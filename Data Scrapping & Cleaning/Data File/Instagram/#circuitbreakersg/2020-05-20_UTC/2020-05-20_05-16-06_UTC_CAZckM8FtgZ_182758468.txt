Last night's dinner
.
❤️ Tonkatsu

Ingredients
- Frozen pork chop from @theladyboymarketplace
- salt
- black pepper
- plain flour
- egg
- oil
- breadcrumb

Steps
1. Make slits at the part where the fat and meat connect. This is to prevent the Tonkatsu to curl up during deep frying

2. Tenderise the pork by using the back of the knife and pound the meat. Repeat in another direction. The pork will be flatten by the pounding, use your hands to gather the pork and mould it back to its original shape

3. Season pork with salt & pepper

4. Beat 1 egg with 1/2 tbsp of oil in a bowl

5. Heat up a oil for deep frying

6. Coat pork with flour, egg and then breadcrumbs

7. Deep fry the breaded pork chop for 45 sec each side and drain off excess oil. Let the pork rest for 4 mins and put the pork back into the heated oil for another 30 sec on each side. Double frying will make the Tonkatsu more crispy

To serve, cut the Tonkatsu into pieces serve with shredded cabbage, tomatoes with a bowl of rice
