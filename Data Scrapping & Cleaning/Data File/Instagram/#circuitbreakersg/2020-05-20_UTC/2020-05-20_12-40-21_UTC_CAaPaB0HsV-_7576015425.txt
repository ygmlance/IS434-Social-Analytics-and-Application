Our globes will be back soon!! ðŸŒŒ
â€¢
In the mean time, here's the story behind [ You, Me, and the Milky Way ]
â€¢
The idea came about while scrolling through travel photos and thinking "how do people take pictures of the stars?" because I tried, and I failed ðŸ˜‚ (swipe to see the failed shot taken while I was travelling in Melbourne last year) â€¢
What's better than a painting of the Milky Way? One with me in it ðŸ™ƒ And that's how our wooden globes slowly started taking shape. â€¢
It took plenty of 4am nights, lots of trial and error (and materials) to get to what it is today.

Thankful to have worked on this with @thecraftstory.sg ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’• won't trade this experience for anything else! We launched it for Valentines Day this year and we are deeply humbled from the response ever since ðŸ’«
