Attempted to recreate Martha Stewart’s  #onepotpasta for lunch today because I had some #onions, #cherrytomatoes and (almost wilting) #basil leaves lying around. I sautéed these in olive oil, seasoning with only #salt and #blackpepper before throwing the #penne pasta and some water (just slightly covering the pasta). After that, all it needed was 14 minutes on medium high heat. Before serving, I added more #oliveoil, black pepper and a generous grating of  #parmesan and it tasted 100/100.. This was super easy to put together and it will definitely be a lunch staple from now..👩🏻‍🍳😋 #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
