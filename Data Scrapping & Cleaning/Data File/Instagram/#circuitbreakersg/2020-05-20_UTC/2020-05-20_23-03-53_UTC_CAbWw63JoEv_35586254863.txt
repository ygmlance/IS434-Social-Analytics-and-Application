Everyday I wake up to see more idiots getting fined because of breaking the CB. Sure, I sort of understand not wearing the mask as it’s very uncomfortable and hard to breathe and this might affect the elderly. However, people gathering for no other reason than to gather is just a complete “fuck you” to the government and shows how little the punishments are. Sure, they might get fined $300 but to most of these people that’s nothing. The government should come down more heavily on these locals who should know better.
