We are truly living in unprecedented times. Being surrounded by food with nowhere to go is a recipe for disaster for anyone who faces problems with their eating habits. For some, it may mean stress eating past the point of fullness. For those who have experienced disordered eating, it may mean relapsing into past eating behaviours. Experiencing quarantine while I was binge eating would've been a complete nightmare for me. Which is why I put together this COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO COPING IN CB! It covers everything from self-care methods to how to maintain healthy eating behaviours. I hope this will help all of you during this stressful period. Do share it with anyone who's struggling with the stress of the situation 😔😔 Stay safe during this period and remember to take care of yourself!!! ❤️❤️❤️ Let me know what you guys think of this and if there's anything in particular you need help with! 👇🏻👇🏻
. 
For those struggling with ED right now, I highly recommend the apps Recovery Record and Rise Up. They allow you to record your meals and emotions associated with eating, and contain additional resources within the app for coping. The account @covid19eatingsupport provides live meal support sessions as well 💪🏻💪🏻
