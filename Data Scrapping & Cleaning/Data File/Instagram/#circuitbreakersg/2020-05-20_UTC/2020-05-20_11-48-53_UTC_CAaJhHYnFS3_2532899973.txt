Define Creativity. Everyone has their own creative side to me. You can craft things and how you craft it depends on ..... how creative you are. How you craft? How you cook, how you arrange your plants or choice of plants?? How you group it together or not / Now coming back to picture, my plants and the way itâ€™s arranged, I call it Abstract. Cha pa Lang they say. It has a story even if it cha pa lang. They ask, you work in a creative place but do you do anything creative? No I donâ€™t. I change toners in the office. I look creative only ðŸ˜’ .
