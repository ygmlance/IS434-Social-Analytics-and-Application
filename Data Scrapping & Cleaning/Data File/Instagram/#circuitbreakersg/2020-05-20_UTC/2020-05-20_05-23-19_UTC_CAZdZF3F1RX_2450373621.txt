An option for Iftar from Yantra. All my friends who are observing Ramadan during this Covid19 period, it must be a very strange and maybe, tough time, with all the social distancing measures during one of the most significant occasions for you. And all that yummy food during your gatherings! Well, if you're looking for a special treat whether for yourselves or for your family and friends to break fast with, check out Yantra's Iftar set featuring its delish lamb biryani and... bandung!
