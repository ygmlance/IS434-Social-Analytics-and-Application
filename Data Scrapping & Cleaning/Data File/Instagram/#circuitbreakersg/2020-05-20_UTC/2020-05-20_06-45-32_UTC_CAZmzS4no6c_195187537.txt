Ban mian is one of my favourite food from hawkers and food courts. We were happy to find out that there's a ban mian stall which delivers to us! We ordered via Grabfood, but I think they have their own delivery as well. I ordered the dry mee hoon kueh. It survived the delivery pretty well, not mushy, and it was served with a small bowl of soup on the side.
