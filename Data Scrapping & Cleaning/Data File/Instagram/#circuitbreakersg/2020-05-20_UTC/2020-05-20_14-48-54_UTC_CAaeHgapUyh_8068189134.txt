Day 43 Circuit Breaker Reflections

So it's back to school on 2nd June, but what many don't see is the behind the scenes work by Schools Leaders, Middle Managers and Teachers to ensure that our kids' learning is not severely compromised and still remains as engaging as possible. It's been a hectic few weeks and it's going to get crazier.

I just need to find that balance in what can be done and what i need to accept can't be perfect or complete. I guess we all have to.

Dedicated to my KP team working tirelessly behind the scenes at Spectra. .
