ðŸ‘‹ Here to wave hey and to say that if youâ€™re waiting for a @pieintheskypicnics experience youâ€™re gonna have to wait a little longer! ðŸ˜¢

We will not be resuming operations on the 2nd of June once the Circuit Breaker is lifted. There are currently no plans to provide DIY picnic set-up kits either. Updates as to when we will resume operations will be made available on Instagram/Facebook ðŸ¦‹

Stay safe and sane! xx
