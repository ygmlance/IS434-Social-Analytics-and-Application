Yong Tau Foo soup served with rice is a fixed staple in our weekly dinner menu. It is everyone’s favourite. This time it is served steamboat style.
Here’s how to make the flat fish powder:
1. Wash n pat dry flat fish
2. Oven bake the flat fish till it’s crisp
3. Use an electric food chopper to grind the oven-baked flat fish into powder form.
4. Put 1-2 tablespoons of the flat fish powder into the pot together with the ikan bilis n soya beans n double-boil for 4 hours.
