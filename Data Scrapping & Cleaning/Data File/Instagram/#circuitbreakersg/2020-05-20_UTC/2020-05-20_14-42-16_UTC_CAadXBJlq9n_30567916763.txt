#circuitbreakersg day 44

Did I say that I love flowers? 🤓
.
.
.
Yes I love 🌸 🌺 so much so that I would eat them! 🤣 .

Made pasta with edible flowers and some herbs for dinner tonight, and boy, was it time-consuming! Not recommended for a weeknight-after-work, made-from-scratch kinda dinner. If not for the fact that the edible flowers which I got could only last a few days, I would have preferred to make these pasta over the weekend instead.
.

.
But, I’m not complaining because I loved the process of making these pretty pasta 😍 which I found very therapeutic! 😇 .
.
.
And I’m grateful for having these pretty and tasty pasta for dinner tonight! 💗 #gratitudediary
