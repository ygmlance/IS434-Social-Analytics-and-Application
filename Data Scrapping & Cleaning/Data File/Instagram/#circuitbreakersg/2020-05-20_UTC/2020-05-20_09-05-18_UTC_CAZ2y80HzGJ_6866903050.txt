To make full use of my #leave during #stayhomeforsg the decision to make something interesting for snack hits me and introducing #wagyusando Itâ€™s so easy to prepare!!!!! All you need is #a5wagyu which I got from @masterager with all the #fats and #marbiling and season with #salt and #pepper immediately from the fridge. Next up #eggs and #breadcrumbs and then deep fry for 1-1.5mins. For the toast, supposedly to use a thick toast but during this #circuitbreakersg there is none available. Hence I use a normal sliced bread and buttered it and used a #airfryer to achieve the oven toast I wanted. Spread some #katsusauce on the sando and slice to serve. Best paired with a #blancdeblancs #ruinart #homecooked #cheers
