We’re under ✌🏻 weeks away from the lifting of Circuit breaker, what this also means is tt we’re gonna be seeing more people going for wet marketing and groceries shopping. While we all slowly ease back to our usual marketing habits, u may probably have to queue up a little longer just to get ur hands on the purchases (‘cos almost the entire nation will be rushing out of their homes after 1/6?) 🤭
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
That said, we want u to remember that we’re still here for you. No snake queue, no long waiting time, zero physical contact w others, 💯 pure convenience only with us.

Chun Fa is just 1 call and 1 DM away to delivering FRESH & AFFORDABLE PORK to you at your doorstep! In fact, you won’t even have to step out of the house to do pork purchase anymore! Try the quality of our pork the 1st time, and you’ll probably keep coming back to us for more purchases! Fingers crossed! 🤞🏻😉
