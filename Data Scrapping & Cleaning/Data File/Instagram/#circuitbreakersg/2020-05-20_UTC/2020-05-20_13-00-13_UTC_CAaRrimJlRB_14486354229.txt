Cleansing is one of the main stages of daily care. Without it, the effectiveness of other procedures will be much lower. Dead cells on the skin provoke clogging, the appearance of roughness, and even an unsightly, slightly grayish hue. That is why it is so important to pay attention to the cleansing procedure using special cosmetics.
