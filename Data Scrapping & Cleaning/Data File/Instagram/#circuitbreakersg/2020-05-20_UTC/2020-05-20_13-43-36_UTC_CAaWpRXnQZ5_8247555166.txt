Missing Japanese food, so here we are having Japanese curry for dinner! ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
âœ¨
Used the S&B golden curry sauce mix as it does not contain any meat derived ingredients. I donâ€™t usually like chicken/pork/beef fats in my food. Chose the level 5 spice level but itâ€™s still not spicy at all for me ðŸ˜‚. I prefer the super hot which I think is the spiciest version but itâ€™s seasonal, so I donâ€™t think itâ€™s available currently. Still delicious nonetheless, especially with the ciabatta from @petitpain.sg whichâ€™s so crusty on the exterior and fluffy inside. With this, I think Iâ€™ve tried all of their bakes. Do you prefer rice or bread to go with your curry? ðŸ¥˜
