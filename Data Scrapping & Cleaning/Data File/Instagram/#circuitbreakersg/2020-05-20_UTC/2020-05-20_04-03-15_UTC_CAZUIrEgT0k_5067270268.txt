EYE OF THE STORM ⠀
The main difference between the somatic approach to movement, living, is that one seeks to embody what is already present, What IS.⠀
The same attitude can be applied to anything, including meditation. Often there is a misconception that there needs to be much effort in creating clarity amidst confusion. The eye of the storm already exists - you just need to recognize it's there, and I've uploaded a guided meditation on soundcloud on this, link in comments below. Hope this brings you some calm and centering, wherever you are.
