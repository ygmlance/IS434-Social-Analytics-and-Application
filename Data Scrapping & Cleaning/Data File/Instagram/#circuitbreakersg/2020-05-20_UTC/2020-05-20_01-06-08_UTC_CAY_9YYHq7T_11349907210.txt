Traditionally this dish is made by poaching a whole chicken then immersing it in an ice bath. Kinda a whole day preparation for dinner.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But ever since I tried this method - so much easier + way less dishes to wash. This is the only way I make it now. And it tastes just like the ones I had in Singapore.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Give it a try and let me know!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
P.S. the rice is ADDICTIVE😃⁣⁣
