Have you picked up some #koreancooking lately?

Here's my Kimchi Stew made in my own kitchen with the help of @ajummasg survival kit. I could cook for two person worth from this. It was very easy to make this Kimchi Pork Belly Stew.

The survival kit ($17.90) comes with the following ingredients;
.
🥩 Pork belly slices
🥣 Pork bone broth
🥬 Kimchi
🥗 Various vegetables
🍚 Short Grain Rice
.
🍽 Served on bowls from @fortytwo.sg
