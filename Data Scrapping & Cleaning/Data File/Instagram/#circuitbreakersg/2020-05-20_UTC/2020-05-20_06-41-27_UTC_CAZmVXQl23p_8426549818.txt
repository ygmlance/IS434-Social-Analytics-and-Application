For those of us working from home, our ad-hoc home offices and the accessibility allowances our companies have given us means it becomes very easy to never stop working. 𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺 𝘣𝘢𝘥!! ⁣

Having all the resources and being ‘at the office’ the whole day makes it  hard to distinguish work from play time. Having the whole day also means less efficiency because you’ve given yourself the ENTIRE day to do your tasks. Because of this, it may feel like you have no time for friends, or it might become very easy to forget to make time for friends. ⁣

Here’s your reminder: 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐝𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 to have brunch, dinner, watch movies, do assignments, work-accountability video chats, exercise times or wine sessions with your friends and significant others! It’ll make you more motivated and driven to complete your tasks faster and also! 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘬 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘧𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘴!!! 🥰⁣

Mark it down in your calendars to make it official. Maybe make it a weekly thing! ⁣
