Chateau Hanteillan 1979

Another #TBT wine. Drank this at the start of #CB. Was given by a friend not too long ago. Ullage mid shoulder, label almost falling out, cork okay came out in 1 piece (after a short prayer). This was simple easy drinking and still more than competant despite its age and humble background.

Not fancy, but I enjoy these old wines a lot. Doubly good if they are from friends!
