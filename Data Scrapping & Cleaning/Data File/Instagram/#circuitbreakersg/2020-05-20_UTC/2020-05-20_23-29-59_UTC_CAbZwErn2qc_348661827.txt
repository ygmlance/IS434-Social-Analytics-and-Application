Back when I was in college, this would have been my wish - to stay home and do nothing all day. Now look at us now? Iâ€™m spending my time seeing how long my hair has grown and deciding if I should stay in my underwear or get dressed...just kidding! In fact, this circuit breaker has proved how stressful my life has become. Iâ€™ll feel sorry for you if you were stuck with me in quarantine (Iâ€™m emotionally needy) ðŸ˜‚. But these are things Iâ€™ve learned: I will never bitch about school anymore. Teachers, you guys are god sent, pls take my kids. Iâ€™ve always loved what I do for a career but this lockdown has made me appreciate my team even more and how much is on the line when livelihoods depends on you. I have realized it doesnâ€™t matter how many meditation classes I take, my patience level with my family is truly tested. I get cabin fever on a daily basis...I need to get out of the house at least once a day. And the kitchen is my enemy....someone needs to padlock my fridge and whisky bar. And there are things I will never take for granted again - time. Time with my family; the privilege of having to get to know each of them. And time to do things I didnâ€™t make time to do before for myself. So much has changed in these past few months, trying to hang on to the things that stayed.
