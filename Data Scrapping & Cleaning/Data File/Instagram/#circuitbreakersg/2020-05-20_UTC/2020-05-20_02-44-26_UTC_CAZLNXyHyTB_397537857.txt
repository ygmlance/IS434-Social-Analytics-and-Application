#CircuitBreakerSG D-44

Rainy morning... perfect for some steamy hot buns & a cup of nice coffee.

Received @MdmLingBakery's Signature Premium Red Bean Bun & Ooze-worthy Salted Egg Yolk Lava Custard Bun from dearest sis @ennieeee yesterday.

Finally get to try the much raved-about buns. The pau is soft & pillowy. The Tau Sar is smooth & mildly sweet as reviewed by most. The Liu Sar Pau is runny & tasty, just like how we like ours from dim sum restaurants. Even mum who's not a pau lover said it's on-point.

I couldn't decide which is my favourite, let me try again tomorrow ðŸ˜…
