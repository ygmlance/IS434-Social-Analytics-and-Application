Happy hump day! Itâ€™s Day 44 of #circuitbreakersg and my pretty paper of the day is this lovely journal with an English garden cover in cerulean blue! Itâ€™s a new journal Iâ€™m thinking of launching.. more details to come soon! Also, with yesterdayâ€™s announcement of the easing of circuit breaker restrictions, Iâ€™m really looking forward to visiting my parents on 2 June and giving them their duit Raya in person ðŸ¥° what are you most looking forward to? #rayatetapraya #eid2020
