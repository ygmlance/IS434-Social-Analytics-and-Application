Tonight was slightly nervewracking as I ordered from a place we had never tried before, that had some pretty mixed reviews. I was craving #thaifood and @kinkinthai888 (delivery arm for @sawasdee.sg in Chinatown), seemed to have a wide selection, so I went ahead.

To our relief, it was overall pretty good. We ordered tom kha soup, green curry chicken (on the soupy side), spicy basil chicken set (with fried egg), Thai omelette, and Pad Phed pork. The omelette was particularly tasty, and the other dishes were decent, so we would certainly consider reordering in the future. They are on @deliveroo_sg, @foodpandasg, and @grabfoodsg (which gave much lower ratings, for some reason).

P. S. No pics but #thanyingrestaurant in Amara hotel is the best Thai we've had in the area so far, though their prices are about double or more. So there is always a tradeoff!
