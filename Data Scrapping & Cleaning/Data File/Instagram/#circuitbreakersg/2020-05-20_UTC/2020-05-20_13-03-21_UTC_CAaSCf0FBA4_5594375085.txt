Made these delish butter cookies & what's even more amazing is that it's a much more healthy version as it's eggless with reduced sugar content. 
Here is my recipe:
250g salted butter at room temperature (I recommend golden churn brand for soft and buttery cookies)
1/4 cup +1tbsp caster sugar or icing sugar (you may increase it to 1/2 cup if you like it more sweet)
2 cups plain flour, sifted
1/3 cup corn starch
1tsp vanilla extract 
Method:
â€¢ Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together on med-high speed until smooth
â€¢ Add in the vanilla extract
â€¢ Combine flour and cornstarch together
â€¢ Transfer to a piping bag with 1M tip â€¢ Pipe into 1-2 inch swirls on baking tray
â€¢ Chill them in fridge for a short while.
â€¢ Bake in a preheated oven at 170 deg C for 15-18mins. Let it cool down & enjoyðŸ˜‹
