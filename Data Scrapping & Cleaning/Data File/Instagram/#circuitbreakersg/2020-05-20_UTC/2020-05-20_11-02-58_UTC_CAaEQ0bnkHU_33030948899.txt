My dear fren @ling_www sent us today’s dim sum lunch from @victorskitchen. She said it was a nice little dim sum place, veryauthentic Hong Kong style. Said the carrot cake with XO sauce is her favourite and specially recommended the chicken feet in abalone sauce.

Indeed, the dim sum was finely made. I especially enjoyed the thin skin of the chee cheong fun, and thought the har kow and siew mai were very plump and tasty. But I think what I enjoyed most was the liu sha bao. The skin was fluffy, and pillowy. No lumpy hard bits. And the lovely oozy golden filling bursting forth like molten lava, when you break the soft skin open... oh the wondrous sight as it leaves little stains on the white snowy skin. And you congratulate yourself that at least it was captured by the skin and you did not drip the precious gold on the plate or table, God forbid! It’s sweet, creamy, slightly salty and sandy all at the same time. Just like how a good little liu sha bao should be. Sigh, made one feel all dreamy-like. I think if there were more, I would have finished them too, oh dear.

The sweet tooth in hubs and the boys drank up the milk tea easily and quickly. And the desserts from @hongkongshengkeedessert totally finished us off for the afternoon. Nothing like a good Cantonese dim sum lunch to set one in for a nice food coma lull before starting work again. Thanks, @ling_www!
