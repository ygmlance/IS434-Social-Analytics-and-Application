#Throwback to my very last overseas trip to Phnom Penh, Cambodia in January before the COVID-19 outbreak started and the next thing we know, everyone everywhere is now being on some sort of a restricted movement. I had never expected that there would be some day like this where all my travel plans are cancelled for the entire year, my paid air tickets have no compensation but me having to pay more to postpone the travel dates with so much uncertainty that still holds in the future. Being much of a solo wanderlust I really missed all my overseas trips and experiences, something which I would never be able to have the same feeling when I'm being coop at home. While I still can't tell when will be the next time I get to travel again, I'm thankful that the #circuitbreakersg will not be extended and more shops will be opened soon, so at least even though we can't be travelling out of Singapore, there's still some local places that I could probably visit during this time. ðŸ˜ƒ #ACtravels #ACtravelogue #ACtraveldiaries #Cambodia #PhnomPenh #sunset #travelexperience
