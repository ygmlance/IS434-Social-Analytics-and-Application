Conclusion of this experimental pandan coconut ogura chiffon baking session, I need to have a better relationship with my oven. I’m not much of a cake baker because I don’t know my oven that well and I tend to somehow screw up when I try baking a cake that requires more temperature precision compared to cooking. This turned out edible not too sweet and soft but I couldn’t get it to look as beautiful as @sonianll original cake recipe. #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #pandanoguracake #trysomethingnew #bakedgoods
