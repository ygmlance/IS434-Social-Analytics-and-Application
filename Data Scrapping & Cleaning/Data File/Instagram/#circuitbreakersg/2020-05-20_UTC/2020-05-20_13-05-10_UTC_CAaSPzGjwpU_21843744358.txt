We had the opportunity to talk to Jake Pang (left), co-founder of @Wafuken, during this #CircuitBreaker downtime and he shared with us that he once weighed over 90kg and went on to shed a whopping 30kg for a boxing competition! 🤩 He's an inspiration that we can all achieve breakthroughs if only we set our minds to it. It was also what drove him to set up Wafuken - a Japanese-style whole grain bowl concept, topped with customisable proteins and sides. ❣😉 For carnivores out there, you're in luck - you can get to enjoy tantalizing meats like smoked duck and oyster blade steak guilt-free, in gourmet sous-vide style. 😋🍖🥩 P.S. We've teamed up for an exclusive 15% discount off on their healthy and delicious bowls - simply use promo code: "ACH15". For more info, see link in bio 😊
