Throwback Ha Giang exploration trip 2019. Its day 44/56 of S'pore Cv-19 lockdown. Wonderful news that Vietnam logged 34th day without a new Cv-19 case. Ha Giang is Vietnam's "final frontier" in the north. You will love the region for it's non-touristy vibes, gorgeous landscape and friendly locals. The infrastructures and cuisine may not be quite ready for international tourists...but that's the refreshing side of Ha Giang. Do visit this lovely region when you are able to. Keep safe and stay sane, Cảm ơn bạn. 😷👍
