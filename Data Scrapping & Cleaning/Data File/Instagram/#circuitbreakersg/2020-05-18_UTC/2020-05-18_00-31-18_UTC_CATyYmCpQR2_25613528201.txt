Char Siu aka Chinese Barbecued Pork.⁠ 🍚

Commonly made with fatty cuts like pork butt or pork shoulder. Marinated for at least 8 hours, cooked in the oven for an hour or so.⁠ 🥡

And tadaaa!! The perfectly charred meat is juicy, tender, and covered with sweet and savory sauce. 🍯⁠⠀

It needs no further description, but the word MAGIC.⁠ 🥢
