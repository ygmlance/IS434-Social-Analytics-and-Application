I bend so I donâ€™t break. I bend so I donâ€™t go apeshit on my kids when they are going crazy at home from the #circuitbreakersg . We only started realising this lockdown was affecting our youngest. Sheâ€™s starting to get withdrawn and quiet. Sometimes not knowing what to do with herself. The boys are just going wild and crazy (screaming and picking physical fights - not that that didnâ€™t happen on a daily basis already but itâ€™s escalated)...itâ€™s insane to juggle work and keep them entertained ðŸ˜­. Makes me want to pull my hair and scream at them constantly but at the same time I realised they are just as stressed as we are. So now they all have journals they have to write in to express their feelings and we go out for a bike ride/walk on a daily basis just to get them out for some vitamin D and fresh air. Why you do bend? #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #covid19 #notalone #singaporetogether #SingaporeAtHome
