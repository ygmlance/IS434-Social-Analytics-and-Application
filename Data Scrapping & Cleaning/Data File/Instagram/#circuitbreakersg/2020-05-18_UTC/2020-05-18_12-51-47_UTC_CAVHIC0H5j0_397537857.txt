#CircuitBreakerSG D-42

Our 3-dish 1-soup dinner to start the brand new week.

Cooked Sesame Oil Chicken 麻油雞; braised with two of my favourite ingredients, Sesame Oil & Ginger. So aromatic!

The other two dishes are Napa Cabbage with Mushrooms and Whitebaits Omelette.

Soup of the day is Lotus Root Pig Tail Peanut Soup 蓮藕豬尾花生湯. It's slow-boiled with Cuttlefish, Dried Scallop, Red & Honey Dates. So flavourful.

Enjoy your #dinner too 🥢🍚
