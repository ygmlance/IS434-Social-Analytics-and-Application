Did you know? We are Singapore’s oldest Chinese vegetarian restaurant - we’ve been around since 1984, so that makes us 36 years young👴🏻👵🏻This #circuitbreakersg has been the toughest challenge we have had to face in all our history so far, and we are definitely not the only ones fighting very hard to hold on. The #vegetarian community has been united and we really appreciate all the support we’ve received 🙏🏻 Let’s continue to help each other in whatever ways we can and hope to come out of this better than before 💪🏻
