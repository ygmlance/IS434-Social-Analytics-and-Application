💖Dual flavoured Tau Sar Piah💖

Mum came back with these gorgeous warm freshly baked tau sar piah. 😍 Red bean paste wasn’t too sweet paired with my favourite salty tau sar piah. 💓 I prefer salty tau sar piah to the sweet ones. But this combo is so good la maybe largely because I love red bean too! 😜
