What a huge change of lifestyle and daily routines we’ve had since the circuit breaker.⁣⁣⠀
⁣⁣⠀
We’ve been busy navigating through new norms. @novaceceliana challenged herself to be just a little more self sufficient at home during the #circuitbreakersg. Did you know she hasn’t purchased leafy greens since the CB started? 
She’s been growing all sorts of nutrient dense and tasty microgreens. She is on a #microgreenrevolution at home. And of course, she is finding new ways to incorporate them into her meals without compromising the nutritional value of these #soilsprouts or #microgreens.⁣⁣⠀
⁣⁣⠀
Interested to find out more about her tips and process of growing microgreens well and abundantly? ⁣⁣⠀
⁣⁣⠀
Join us this 𝗪𝐞𝐝𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐝𝐚𝐲 (𝟐𝟎 𝐌𝐚𝐲 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟎), 𝟏𝐩𝐦 on an IG live video where we will share some growing tips and 2 original microgreen recipes. ⁣⁣⠀
