so i have been spending my free time reading this book called Mummy’s Guilt, written by a Sporean mum Eleanor Lin.
its content is really great and it actually prep you thru the ups n downs of what motherhood is all about! especially for the first time mummies😩there is always so much guilt in us that we need to overcome it.💪🏻

motherhood is not a competition to see who has the smartest kids, the cleanest house, the healthiest dinner, Motherhood is UR journey with UR children. ✌🏻❤️
