Rise and shine! Mr K woke up to this bagel sandwich this morning and that definitely put a ðŸ˜Šon his face. He was quietly enjoying it. ðŸ˜‚Came across these @bakerandcooksg sourdough bagel at Tanglin Mall yesterday and thought maybe should give it a try since how much we love sourdough bread.
.
Iâ€™ve sliced it into half. Add butter to a hot pan and wait for it to melt completely. Place the bagel on the pan and wait for it to turn slightly brown or lightly crisp on the edges. You can then add your favourite toppings onto this delicious bagel. Enjoy!
