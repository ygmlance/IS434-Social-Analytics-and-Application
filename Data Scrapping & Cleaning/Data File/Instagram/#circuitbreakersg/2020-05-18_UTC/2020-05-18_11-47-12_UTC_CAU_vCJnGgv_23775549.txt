Strawberry Mille Crepe Cake by my daughter @natsu_kuro_shiro
A recipe from the Anime, Yumeiro Patisserie she watched.
She woke up at 5am and do it all on her own. As I don't bake, there isn't a whisk at home. She managed to come up with the last min idea to use the blender to "whip" the cream. Took her 6 hours to trial and error and  make such yummy crepe cake!
Craving Satisfied!
