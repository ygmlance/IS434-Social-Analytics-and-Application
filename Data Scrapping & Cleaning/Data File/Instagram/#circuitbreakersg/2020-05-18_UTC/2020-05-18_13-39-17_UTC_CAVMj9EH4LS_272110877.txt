Day 40. Started off a cloudy morning that brought us refreshing, cool breeze. Made a tornado omelette rice as a treat to celebrate our 22nd anniversary. Turbulence started after we became legally married. 😆 Mr. was caught off guard when I presented this dish to him. He finished his share within minutes with all smiles.  The evening sky represented our mood. #stayhome  #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #tornadoomeletterice #龙卷风蛋包饭 #instadaily
