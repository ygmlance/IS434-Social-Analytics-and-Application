👭Happiness is a friend arriving unexpectedly on an empty day.👭 One of my BFFs stay just across the street and before CB, we sometimes have cozy meet-ups in my house. I’m so looking forward to resuming those chit chat afternoon tea sessions again after CB. 🥰🥰🥰🥰 Today, I didn’t feel like going out to buy breakfast because it’s so hot. So, I decided to just eat simple- leftover Gardenia bread with butter cookies. Then I had the idea of converting my bread into a football field and cookies into footballs. Also a great opportunity to pay tribute to my Hubby’s favourite Liverpool Football Club. 😍He has been a loyal hardcore fan for years and is eagerly looking forward to the resumed EPL matches soon! 🤗🤗🤗I used Hersey strawberry syrup and the Liverpool logo is really difficult to draw- especially the words “LIVERPOOL” and “EST.1892”. I actually contemplated stopping at just drawing the Liver Bird without the wordings. 🤣Anyway, hopefully one day, I can accompany my hubby to Liverpool Anfield to watch a match. In return, he can bring me to Paris and buy me a Chanel Handbag. 🥰🥰🥰 🤩🤩🤩
