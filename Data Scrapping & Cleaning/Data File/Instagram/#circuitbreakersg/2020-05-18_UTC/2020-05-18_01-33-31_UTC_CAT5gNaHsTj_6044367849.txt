Here is the outcome of the challenge I accepted from @kumudakrovvidi in support of @7stories.sg fundraising campaign #7000steps and #7000steps4migrantworkers today! I absolutely loved the idea and spirit behind the campaign and congratulate them for initiating it!

They will donate $7 for every 7k steps you walk in support of migrant workers!
