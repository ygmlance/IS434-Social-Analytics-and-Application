18 May 2020 — Our firstborn is 44 months today! Did a self check & she’s currently 97cm tall, 14.2kg. Petite girl she is, but not skinny la. She’s meaty & eats a lot like her Marler, but luckily gt long legs genes from the Farler. 🥰

Paiseh, Mama doesn’t remember to post every month, so I tried to take nicer pics of you today! 😂 #CircuitBreakerSg will end in 2 weeks’ time (if nothing goes wrong suddenly 🤞🏻), & I’m glad that you are coping considerably well being cooped at home with me most of the time. Meltdowns happen time to time, but you always want a hug from me though you were very mad at me. Sticky Sweet Silly daughter of mine... 😅

Thankful for her super onz school, teachers conducted online HBL classes on all weekdays, ensuring the kids are on track on the academic syllables. And I get to witness firsthand Faith being quite a good & inquisitive student. 不错嘛，有前途 (speaking from an ex-teacher’s pov 😆)

Last but not least, Faith surprised me with her replies when she saw my past pregnant photos after checking out my new shots of her. 👇🏻
Mama: Do you know where are you? 
Faith: Inside your tummy. 
Mama: Do you remember your time inside? (I never expect an answer TBH)
Faith: Swimming & Sleeping. (Then she laughed to herself) 
Mama 😱: Wow.. did you eat anything inside? 
Faith: No... just swimming & sleeping. (Then she looked at me sadly) Nothing to eat inside. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
