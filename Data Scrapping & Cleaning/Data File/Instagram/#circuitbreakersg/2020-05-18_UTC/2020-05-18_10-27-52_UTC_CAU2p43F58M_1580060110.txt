Foccacia
--------------------------------------
For someone who expresses so much on instagram, I don't know why I waited till now to read up on food styling. I am still very new at this, but I have been wanting to up the quality of my photos and content. I am definitely in the baby stages of this and like cooking, it is gonna take practice. My first venture is with a simple foccacia. Haven't made this bread in over 2 years. Simple and satisfying, albeit slightly oily. But hey its italian! Just FYI, I am still using phone cameras at this stage. Need feedback on how I did and how to improve. Cheers all!
