Itâ€™s such a pleasure to cook carb-free soup which is tasty and nutritious. No salt required when the soup is flavoured fully by the crab meat sticks, fishballs, cherry tomatoes, baby spinach, dried scallops, dried shrimps and egg. Totally satisfactory in emptying the bowl. Zero food waste! #covid19 #circuitbreakersg
