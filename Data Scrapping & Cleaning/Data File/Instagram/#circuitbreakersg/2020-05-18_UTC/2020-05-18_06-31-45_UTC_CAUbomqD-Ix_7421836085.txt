Today we will look at Indirect Wealth, also known as 偏财. People with a high percentage of  Indirect Wealth are street smart with high EQ, and they know how to get what they want in a deal. They believe in letting their money work for them through different investment platform to gain passive income. Working 9 to 6 is not what they want eventually. They handle set back well to keep them going. They believe in the more you give, the more you receive. 
With them being generous with money, they might seem to be a spendthrift and someone who does not understand the value of money. Risking for windfall gain is something that they need to work on to improve. Learn to exercise self-control is very important too.

The career that is suitable for people with high 偏财 percentage is Investor, Trader, Business Owner, Stock Broker.
