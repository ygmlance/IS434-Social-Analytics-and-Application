#stayhomestaysafe period the most happy alive thing at home are my plants. They are getting lotsa love. I bought this baby ficus elastica (rubber plant) with only 3 to 4 leaves and now it has 12 leaves and still growing. Giving her a new home in a new ceramic glazed pot that I got it from japan before the cb. Using the @plantonic_official fertilizer (organic plant base) #supportsglocal and coconut fibers. #sgplants #sgplantslover #circuitbreakersg #ficuselastica #rubberplant #plantonic #plantsdecor #plantsofinstagram #plantparent #plantsinspiration#plantblogger #plantblog#rubberplant #houseplanthome#plantparenthood
