Challenged by @jesstaecie to draw something related to form for #jezzychallenge - How would objects in different forms look like? Hehe hello, this is me in the form of a cat. Trying to balance everything that is valuable to me. The people I love, work, life, God. One thing I definitely struggle to balance is trying to stay healthy, while not missing out on the food and drinks I love. Bubble tea, gummies, potato chips and ice cream, anyone? 
At the end of the day, I hope I can be like this cat, looking up towards whatâ€™s most valuable to Me - God. And may He help me to balance everything else ðŸ’›
