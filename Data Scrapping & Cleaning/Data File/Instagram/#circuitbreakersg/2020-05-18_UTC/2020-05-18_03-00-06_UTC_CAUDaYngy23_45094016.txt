Brunch.

When eating is life but 3D integration is lifer at the moment. There are times when we got so much to check in the existing 3D model especially the elevations and tie-in point issues due to the old authoring tool used, and the Circuit Breaker demands more output from engineering design and BIM team!

This is part of the package though. Still always grateful we still have jobs and work to do. Itsumo gambarimashyo! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ #StayHomePICEsg #WeArePICEsg #Brunch #circuitbreakersg #stayhomenotice #BIM #bimmanagement #epcproject
