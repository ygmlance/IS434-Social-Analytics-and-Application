We've got some big buns hun 😎

The joy that comes from baking is the process itself! Hands up if you agree! 🙋‍♀️ We test, test and test again because we want to use the best ingredients with the greatest combination and the richest flavour.

As much as we have received DMs about our chocolate milk bread, we aren't selling it now as we're still working on making it more AWESOME!

Our main item on the menu is our Oreo Chocolate Cake, which we have served to many satisfied customers! But you can always follow us to get the latest updates when the milk bread and other black bakes appear on our menu!
