~ Hokkaido Milk Corn Chowder ~ I have been wanting to try cooking something with Hokkaido milk. So this is an easy and delicious soup with the sweetness of corn and the creaminess of the Hokkaido milk. I topped it over rice and added some shredded chicken for protein. Both Simlets slurp it up in minutes so its an achievement on a Monday. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #hokkaidomilk #cornchowder #japanesefood #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
