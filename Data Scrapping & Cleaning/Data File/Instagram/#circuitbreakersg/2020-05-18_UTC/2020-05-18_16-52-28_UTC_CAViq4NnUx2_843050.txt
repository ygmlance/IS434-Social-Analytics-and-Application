Tried to make DTF-style Egg Fried Rice for lunch today but IMO there’s plenty of room for improvement. Need a bigger wok for stir frying, and I need to get a better timing to put the rice into the eggs so the rice would be coated nicely. 
Thankfully my family is supportive as always and finished their meal.. but not me haha. There’s much to be improved on this dish. Must try again to make this dish! 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 .
