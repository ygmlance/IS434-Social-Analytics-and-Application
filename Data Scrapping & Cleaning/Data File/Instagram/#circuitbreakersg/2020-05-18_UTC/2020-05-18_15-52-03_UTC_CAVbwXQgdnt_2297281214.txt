Kept it simple for day 42's dinner with bak chang (rice dumplings) with a splodge of garlic chili and chap chye (braised vegetables)... I tried something different with the chap chye and cooked it with a bit of lard, dried shrimp and carrot... Verdict: it was the bomb!  Happy camper alert! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
