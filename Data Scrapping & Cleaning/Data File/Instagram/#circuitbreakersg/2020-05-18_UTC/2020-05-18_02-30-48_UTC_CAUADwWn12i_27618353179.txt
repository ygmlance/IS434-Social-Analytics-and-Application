Honey Banana Nutella cake! 
Baked this yesterday as we happened to have all the ingredients, and it turned into a massive Banana huat kueh ahhaha. Interesting how butter and sugar werent used for this recipe at all :) The cake is sweet in a wholesome way because of the honey and banana. Not sure if wholesome is a word used to describe cakes but u know, the sweetness tastes natural :) to our surprise it turned out sweeter today (how is that even possible?!). The next time i make this, I might reduce Nutella.. can't taste it at all this time ahha. Not sure what to bake next.. have to ration ingredients because I'm running out of vanilla essence, cant find them in stores ðŸ˜«

This also explains why I've been cooking more than baking these days ðŸ¤­
