💈💇🏻‍♂️ HUHA HAIR SALON 💇🏻‍♀️💈
Hello everyone 👋 
Happy Monday! Let’s work towards a fruitful week ahead with our little ones 💕
.

Few days back many flocked to the hair salons after circuit breaker measures ease in Singapore 🇸🇬. I guess many fear turning into wolverine and unrecognisable amongst family and friends once this pandemic is over. To each it’s own but staying safe is always a wiser option 💕
.

Enough of my random thoughts 💭 so we decided to launch our very own stay-at-home HuHa hair salon 💇🏻‍♂️💇🏻‍♀️❤️❤️
We provide one of a kind hair cut, wash and massages 💆🏻‍♀️💆🏻‍♂️at a competitive price. So sit back, relax and let our talented hairstylists work their magic ✂️ HuHa’s simple pop up store concept is made of #cardboard where their tools 🧰✂️ are easily removed or attached should they prefer the cardboard tools ✂️ to their wooden ones ✂️. Not forgetting the aluminium foil mirror and purple chairs for the waiting customers. We had so much fun role playing as a family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦💕 .

Take care and stay safe always everyone 😍
