Almost 4 years ago I had a huge career change. It was a big change for me from #clinicalradiology to Aesthetic Dermatology. I was already halfway through my Radiology Post Grad and just had 2 more papers to go. It was also really difficult starting a new in a very different field, whereby there is also a lot of competition. I had to pick up the pieces again from almost the beginning. It definitely took a lot of COURAGE and HUMILITY. Looking back I absolutely have NO REGRETS and I love every bit of my work now. I love making things(people) beautiful! There is a major role in providing healthcare in a more COMPREHENSIVE way including treating outer appearance ~👸😇🌸

During this pandemic, I am sure a lot of friends and family around us are affected as well in terms of livelihood. Graduates having difficulty getting job, working class getting laid off and even some industries forced to close down (editorials, aviation, F&B, travel, to name a few).✈️🛫🏖️ Even general docs experience lower volume of patients -

The truth is, our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are deeply uncomfortable or unhappy. For it is in such moments, propelled by our discomfort that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers.

Just want to say, never give up no matter the situation/bleakness. The light is definitely at the end of the tunnel 🔚🕯️🕯️🕯️
