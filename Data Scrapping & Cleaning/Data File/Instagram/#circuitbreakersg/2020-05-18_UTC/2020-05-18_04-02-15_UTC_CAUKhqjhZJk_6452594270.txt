Ordered Al-Arafa Restaurant's mix grill platter for 2-3pax. Half a grilled chicken, a huge lamb shank and a big container of fragrant mandi rice. The portion is massive that we could only finish half of it on day 1 and kept the rest of it to finish on day 2.

And that's not all. Their set even comes with a small bowl of assorted fruits, porridge for breaking fast, a bottled drink and dessert. This is the 2nd time we're having this set (one in the restaurant itself last year) and we were not disappointed. The lamb was so soft that it fell off from the bone. The smell of the rice is just tantalising. The sauce that comes together with it goes so well with the rice. And the best part is that the taste of their food has not changed one bit since the last time we tried. It's a must try if you love middle-eastern cuisine!
