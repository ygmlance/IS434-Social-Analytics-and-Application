Day 42 Circuit Breaker Dinner. Feel like having some spicy fried noodles tonight!  Also in the mood to sautÃ© some onions (in olive oil and chopped garlic). Added balsamic vinegar this round. ðŸ¤—
Simple ingredients: One whole yellow onion, 3 ladies fingers, one tomato and one serving of noodles.
Cooked the noodles. Added some garlic infused extra virgin olive oil to the noodles, two teaspoon of soya sauce and one teaspoon of extra hot lemon chilli sauce. Mix well in the centre of the pot. Then fry the vegetables together with the noodles. 
Turned out exactly how I wanted it to be. ðŸ˜‹
