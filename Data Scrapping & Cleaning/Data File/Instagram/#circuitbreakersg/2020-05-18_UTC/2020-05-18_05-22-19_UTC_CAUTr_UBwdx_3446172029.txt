Top of the week to you! Itâ€™s Day 42 and suddenly itâ€™s less than a week to Hari Raya! When youâ€™re fasting, the time really flies, doesnâ€™t it? It flies even more now that weâ€™re in #circuitbreakersg mode ðŸ˜„ anyway, today is the last day for you to place your orders if you would like them to arrive by Sunday! Do remember that there will definitely be delays with all the restrictions in place. Thanks so much for your support ðŸ¥° #rayatetapraya #eid2020
