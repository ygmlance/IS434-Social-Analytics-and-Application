[hiding in my closet] series
2009
One of the pieces I lugged all the way back from Queen's Camel.  It was the very first summer pottery workshop I attended in UK. 
The instructor Douglas Philips told me (in a rather deadpan manner) "you mustn't trim away your mistakes,  you must learn to throw better". Was one of the most valuable advice I had received in my earlier learning days. 
If our pots couldn't dry in time for the firing end of the week (in UK summer where it rained most days), then it wouldnt get fired at all.
