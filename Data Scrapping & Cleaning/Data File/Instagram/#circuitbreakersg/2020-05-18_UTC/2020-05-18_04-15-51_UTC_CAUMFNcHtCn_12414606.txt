We all know how important it is to keep our little pre-schoolers developing and learning throughout this circuit breaker period, and as a parent I’m very happy with the worksheets and activities that are given daily for Nykki to do while we stay home.
.

Some of the home-based learning activities can be particularly fun and great bonding opportunities for parent and child too, especially the dance videos (even the doggo was so entertained and refused to move).
.

Thank you My First Skool for making sure that our kids always have fun learning. I really appreciate the dedication and creativity of the teachers from the pre-school to make sure that the content and materials put up are well thought out and effective.
