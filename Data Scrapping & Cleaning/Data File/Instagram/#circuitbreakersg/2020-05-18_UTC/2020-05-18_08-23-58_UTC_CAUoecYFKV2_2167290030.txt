DAY 41, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
OATS BREAKFAST
If you haven't tried oasts with Banana and peanut butter, please do so. Its a match made in heaven. Add other things too if you want. I added wheat puffs and papaya. The berries are just to make it look pretty ðŸ˜‰
The oats are cooked in milk. If you like, you can cook it in water and add yoghurt after it cools down. .
