Our large flowerpot tiramisus are back! 🌼

Thanks everyone for the overwhelming response for our pretty flowerpot tiramisus over the last 2 weekends! We appreciate all of your kind words and positive feedback ❤️ Due to popular demand, we are now opening up more slots for these flowerpot tiramisus. Starting from today, 18 May 2020, we are accepting pre-orders for pick-up/delivery for this upcoming long weekend (22 - 24 May) until our slots are full!

These large flowerpots tiramisus are good for 5 - 8pax and are selling at $68 each (alcohol / non-alcohol options available - please specify with your order!). The flower types would depend on seasonal availability so apologies in advance that we will not be able to guarantee the type/colour of flowers used. However, we would ensure that it is as similar as possible to those in the pictures attached 😊

Do call/ WhatsApp us at 9278 0466 to order one early and make someone's day! 💐
