👩‍🍳MUNCH AT HOME👩‍🍳
Png Kueh and Soon Kueh are childhood snacks that we’ve grown up eating😋We always remember our parents would make a quick stop at Yong’s Teochew Kueh while driving us to school, grab us a few and we’ll munch on them for breakfast - fond memories indeed🥰 Realized we had a Png Kueh mould at home so why not make our own! Png Kueh is a teochew dumpling stuffed with flavoured glutinous rice🍚 mixed with dried shrimp🍤, mushrooms and peanuts🥜As our grandma👩🏼‍🦳 loves this dish but unable to eat the store-bought ones often due to her shrimp allergy😣, we decided to make it to satisfy her cravings🤤! Really pumped to challenge ourselves in making a traditional kueh!💯 After steaming the kueh or you could totally pan fry it for some extra crisp, drizzle on some sweet dark soy sauce and it’ll definitely make a scrumptious snack! Remember to brush on some shallot oil for that extra smell and flavour to really come through🤤
