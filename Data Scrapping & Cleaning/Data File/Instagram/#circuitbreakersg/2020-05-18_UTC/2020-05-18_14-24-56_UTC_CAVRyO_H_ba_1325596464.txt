Am I alone in this?
.
As much as I hate it, I’m going to miss it... Some parts of it.
.
I hate crowds and I love waking up on weekdays to the family. Here’s a picture that represents them both - being able to wake up early before I start my #wfh and bring my boy for an early morning ride sans the crowd.
So...#circuitbreaker ... as much as I hate the #lockdown , I will miss some aspects of it.

Am I alone in this?

Photo: The boy is a confident 2-wheeler now and loves to ride on the bumpy gravel road than the smooth PCN... another mountain biker in the making ! Yeah!
