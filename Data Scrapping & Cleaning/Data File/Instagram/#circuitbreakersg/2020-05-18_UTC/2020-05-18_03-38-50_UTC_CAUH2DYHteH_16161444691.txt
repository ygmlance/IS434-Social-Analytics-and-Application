COVID-19: Keeping SG safe as circuit breaker (CB) eases

Cases in the community have dropped due to CB
⚠️ But it will go up as we restart activities - So we must relax CB gradually to prevent a second wave

Recent community cases
- Priority is to protect our vulnerable seniors
- All should stay at home as long as possible, whether young or old 👶👴 Safe reopening of workplaces
- Employers to implement safe management measures
- Telecommuting should remain the default

We have made significant adjustments in the way we live and work. These have yielded results

We must keep up our good habits:
↔️ Safe distancing
🧼 Personal hygiene
😷 Wearing a mask when out
