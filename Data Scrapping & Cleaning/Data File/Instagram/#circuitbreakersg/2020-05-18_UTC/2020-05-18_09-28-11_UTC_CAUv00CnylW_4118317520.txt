Two months of circuit breaker = 180 meals to cover for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That’s a huge feat, even for a top chef! Every day we ask the kids, “what would you like to eat tomorrow?” because the Husband and I ran out of ideas in the first two weeks! Did you too?

Avril’s favourite food in school is Fried Mee Tai Mak, and Papa’s version 3 weeks ago failed to make the cut. So we were so happy when MFS shared the recipe last week (https://bit.ly/mfs-ytrecipes-meetaimak), and tadah! finally approved by Princess Avril since Papa followed it closely.

Thankful for My First Skool who’ve been supporting us parents in home-based learning resources from the start, we have so much to do every day! From incorporating items we can find at home to teaching English phonics, counting Math and prepping Avril for Primary 1 (pretend to buy food from Papa!) to sharing MFS’ healthy food recipes, we’ve done almost everything!

We get a phone call from her teachers everyday at 1pm, who’d ask if she was feeling okay; and she meets her classmates via Zoom twice a week where the kids do simple craft to reinforce HBL activities given by her teachers. Last week, Avril made a Mother’s Day card for me while guided by her teachers! Masen’s only 12 months now, but I can’t wait for him to join the wonderful team that his siblings grew up with.
