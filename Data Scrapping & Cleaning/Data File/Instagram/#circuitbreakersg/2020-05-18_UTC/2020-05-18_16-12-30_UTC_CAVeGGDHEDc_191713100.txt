🕢Dinner: Ram-don 🇰🇷
Ram-don,aka Jjapaguri with steak, the signature noodle dish in 'Parasite', the Oscar-winning hit for Best Picture Film.

Jjapaguri,a combination of two types of instant noodles-Chapagetti ,Chinese-inspired jajang ramen noodles, and Neoguri,Japanese-style udon reimagined in a spicy, Korean seafood broth in one pot.It’s yummy chewy noodles in a Jjajang sauce that has a hint of spicy udon flavor, if you love Jjajangmyeon then you will love this combination.

In the movie, a cheap Jjapaguri dish is topped with expensive premium Korean beef (hanwoo) which symbolises the rich Park family trying to glamorize a cheap dish – as just a plain Jjapaguri is not good enough for a wealthy family. And yes, it also does apply to the reality to some extent, the ultra-rich Koreans love to put glamor in everything.

As for me, apart from topping with the beef, I also prefer adding the green onions that makes it taste so much better!

This is a plate of a very cheap Ram-Don in a very very expensive way.

But it’s sooooo Mashisoyo 😋 
Lip Smacking Good!
