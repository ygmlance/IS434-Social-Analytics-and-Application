18 May 2020 #Day42 of #circuitbreakersg: Baked a birthday cake for my boy’s bff Jayden. Was having half the mind of baking because I couldnt find any strawberries for the decorations!! All i had was mangoes because i bought a lot (my kids love mangoes)! I thought I shouldnt let the strawberries disrupt my plans, so I went ahead. I can only say, my knife skills is not that good 😝 I tried my best to put up the best presentation 😅 I also realised why all mango cakes has a gelatine top coat! 🤣
