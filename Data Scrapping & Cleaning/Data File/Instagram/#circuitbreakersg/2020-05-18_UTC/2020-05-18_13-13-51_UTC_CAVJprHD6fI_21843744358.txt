Have you been experiencing pain in your jaws? This could be a sign that your wisdom teeth are coming in or are causing you problems! 🤕🤕🤕⁠
⁠
Wisdom teeth are the final set of molars that we will grow in our lives, making their appearance only when we are around the age of 18 to 26 years old. 😮 Being such a "late bloomer", these teeth often does not have enough room in the gum to grow out properly - causing them to erupt partially, sideways or even “impacting” into the other teeth. 💢💢💢⁠
⁠
Tell-tale signs of an impacted wisdom teeth include pain, headache, aching jaws, swollen gums, difficulty chewing food, etc. 😷 Therefore, if you were to experience any of these symptoms, be sure to get your teeth checked out in a dental clinic! It could be that your wisdom teeth are giving you pain.⁠
