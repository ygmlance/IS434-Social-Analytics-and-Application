Day 42 of #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Got my act together and actually baked a cake in the morning rather than late into the night. Been wanting to try this marble cake recipe from the BBC and so I finally did. There are lots of recipes floating all over, esp what 3 ingredient cake or whatever, but I prefer to rely on tried and tested sources. You never know whether something that sounds too good to be true is #fakenews or click bait.
.
It tastes quite pleasant. I personally find it not sweet and buttery enough but the husband enjoyed it. @edward365 went for 2 pieces. If you like your marble cake mild, you should try this recipe. Oh one tip, mix the cocoa directly into the batter rather than to do the paste that they suggested because the paste form doesnâ€™t mix well!
.
Will upload the recipe here shortly. .
