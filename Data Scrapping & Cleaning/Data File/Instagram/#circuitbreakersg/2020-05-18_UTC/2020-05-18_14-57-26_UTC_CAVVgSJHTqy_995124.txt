Our first home cooked meal during this CB! This Ma La Xiang Guo tasted so good, all thanks to Haidilao Ma La paste..you can actually save a lot when you cook this on your own, without burning a hole in your pocket! We added beef, broccoli, cabbage, oyster mushroom, sausage & crab meat. #stayhomewithascott #mala #malaxiangguo #sichuanfood #loveformala #dinner #cookyourselves #capitalmall #ascott #donation #damnspicy #nomnom #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
