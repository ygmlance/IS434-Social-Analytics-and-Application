Day 42 - #circuitbreakersg
🎨
I rarely paint because I can't control the colours and brush very well. Finally took the courage to attempt painting after dinner (after watching a painting tutorial online)
😅
I guess its not too bad for first try... I messed up with the backdrop and tried to patch with more trees. Looks pretty from afar...
