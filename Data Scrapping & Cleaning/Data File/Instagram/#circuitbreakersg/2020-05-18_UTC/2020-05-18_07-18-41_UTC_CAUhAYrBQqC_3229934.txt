My every day life before the circuit breaker was never solidly routine. I do admit, I am feeling very restless and on most days, quite unproductive while i battle the thoughts in my mind that are filled with worry, wonder and more pleasantly, enlightenment.

But of course, I do miss holding a mic in my hand. 
Anyone else feeling sentimental? ðŸ˜…
