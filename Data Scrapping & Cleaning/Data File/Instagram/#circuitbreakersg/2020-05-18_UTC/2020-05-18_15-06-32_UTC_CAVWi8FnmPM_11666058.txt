ðŸ‘«The OG team.

Hereâ€™s 3 things that helped us during circuit breaker - managing expectations, discussing needs and remembering to be thankful, always.

We try to cover each other as much as we can so our work doesnâ€™t get affected. Nudge each other when we have unrealistic expectations towards kids, chores and even self. Most importantly, remembering our â€˜thank you(s)â€™. It helps that we build healthy relationship in our household and remember to appreciate one another. It makes tough/challenging times more bearable and us, happier.

Letâ€™s all #stayhomestaysafe not just from COVID19 but also any forms of abuse. We can play a part to #breakthesilence so help can be rendered to families who require additional support/ counselling during this unprecedented time. If you forget all the helplines, donâ€™t forget thereâ€™s 999.
