Good afternoon to day 42 of Singapore's "circuit breaker"! Picked up some bak chang (zong zi or rice dumplings) last night as they're one of @iamivanlau's favourite things to eat...
Bak chang is a traditional Chinese rice dumpling made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings like meat, chestnut, salted egg all wrapped in bamboo leaves and steamed or boiled... It is absolutely delicious with a splash of my fave sriracha chili or garlic chili sauce...
Although eaten all year round, bak chang is traditionally eaten during Duan Wu Jie, otherwise known as the Dumpling Festival or the Dragon Boat Festival... The celebration is on the 5th day of the 5th lunar month according to lunar calendar which is around June... üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
