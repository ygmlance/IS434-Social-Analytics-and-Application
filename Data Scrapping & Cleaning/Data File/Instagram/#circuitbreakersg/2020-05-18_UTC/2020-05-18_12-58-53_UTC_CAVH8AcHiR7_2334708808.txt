Cooked 三杯鸡(Taiwanese three cup chicken) for dinner today since I got plenty of super fresh Thai basil from my lovely sister.. I like mine to be a little saucier coz it goes so well with rice 😍 #homecooked #homecooking #dinnerfortwo #simplemeal #stayhomestaysafe #circuitbreakersg #countingdownthedays
