My spam fried rice is so quick and super easy to make! I used Korean spam, egg, rice, garlic and spring onion. Combine 2 tbs soy sauce, 
2 tbs shaoxing wine and 1 tbs sugar in a small mixing bowl, mix well until sugar has dissolved and set aside.

I used @ninjakitchensg #ninjafoodiop300 to cook my rice. Set Pressure function for 10 mins. Once rice is ready, take out the rice, set Sauté function, preheat for 5 mins and add oil, fried beaten eggs. Scramble the egg to cook evenly. When the egg is cooked 3/4 way, remove from the pot and set aside. Add oil, cook spam until all the edges are golden brown. Stir in chopped garlic and cook for 1 min. Now add rice then last the egg. Add sauce mixture and salt, stir fried for 1-2 mins. Garnish with spring onion. I had also set Air Crisp function for my frozen brocoli 🥦 a side for my spam fried rice 👍
