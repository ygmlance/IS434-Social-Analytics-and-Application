Paul Chambers Sextet - Whims Of Chambers, 1957. This is one serious lineup. #johncoltrane #donaldbyrd #horacesilver #kennyburrell #phillyjoejones. Imagine all these icons in the same room! Sure, this was Coltrane on the ascent but not quite at peak. Byrd, Burrell and Silver took turns to lead and support seamlessly and this record just sounds supreme. #paulchambers was just 21 when he led this album and went on to be one of the most significant bassist from the era. Absolutely love this album!  #paulchamberssextet #whimsofchambers #bluenoterecords
