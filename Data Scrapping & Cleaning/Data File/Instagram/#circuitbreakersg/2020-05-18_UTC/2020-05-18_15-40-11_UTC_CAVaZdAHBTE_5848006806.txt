Today was a fruitful day! We baked more cream puffs and did marble painting ðŸŽ¨ The kids no doubt enjoyed themselves while I had the fun job of chasing after the marbles after the little man discovered that they could bounce! Lucky me! And donâ€™t get me started on the cleaning up. But the point is they had fun and thatâ€™s all that matters. And we had some pretty neat artwork for their room. ðŸ–¼ .
