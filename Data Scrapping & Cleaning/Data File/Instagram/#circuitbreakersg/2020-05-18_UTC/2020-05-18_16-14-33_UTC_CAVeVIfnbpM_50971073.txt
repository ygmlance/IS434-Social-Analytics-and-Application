Love the glaze on the pork belly... pan fried the pork belly before i braise it in japanese style... hubs n kids loved it... .
We did Steamed Radish the first time... not too bad for our first time... not too dry... chewy nice n soft...

Leftover white rice and 腊味饭 from last night dinner so fry it together and tasted so yummy... then Creamy Pasta for kids... they cleared all... #circuitbreakersg Day 42
