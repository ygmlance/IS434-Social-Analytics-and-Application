Hello new week! Although let’s be honest 🧐 this past month has been a mashup of days and weeks 😅. Anyways, always a good time for me to practice backbends 🥨 and feeling stronger in this drop backs. 20reps will come eventually @zhiqian.tay for now I’m still in my 6-8 comfort zone 😬 but thanks for the inspiration.
