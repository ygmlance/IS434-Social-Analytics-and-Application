There’s always time for desserts! 🍭

Made a sugar free chocolate lava cake using Valrhona 70% Guanaja dark chocolate, and it turned out to be so rich and decadent, though I think it could more oozy. Shall try baking it at a shorter duration next round. Swipe ⬅️ to view the chocolatey goodness! 🍫

Totally loving the bitter notes to the lava cake since I didn’t add any sugar. Instead, I paired it with some choc cookie dough ice cream from @uddersicecream to add some sweetness and they’re such a perfect match! First time trying this flavour and I must say it was quite impressive. Mega love for the cookie dough chunks within! 🍪

Balanced out the richness with a cup of hot kuki hojicha tea from @antea.social. Somehow it’s starting to grow on me after several drinks, and I enjoy the pairing of chocolate with houjicha! 🍵
