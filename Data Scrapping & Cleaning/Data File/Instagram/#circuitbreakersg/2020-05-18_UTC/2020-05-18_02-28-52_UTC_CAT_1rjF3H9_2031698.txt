Day 42 circuit breaker/ Day 13 HQO thoughts:

Stay close to people who feel like sunshine.

Stay away from people who cannot handle rejection maturely even though I served it with honesty and with pure intention.

Also, I think my plant babies growing handsomely and beautifully, they deserved a square ðŸ¤­

And, I need to go for second swab test today, specially brought to me by MOH according to the lady at call center~
So much hassle, so much love, so annoying~ The back of my throat swollen for 2 days after the 1st test. ðŸ˜£ðŸ¥º Whatever, accepting what life is throwing at me and let it go~
