Things to do with the kids #59

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Hey, Vanilla, look what I can do with my eyes." "Titus, what on earth did you do? You look like you sat next to a glass of radium." "Vanilla, Marie Curie may have carried test tubes of radium around with her in her pocket, but in case you hadn't noticed, I'm a cat, and I don't have any pockets." "I could have told you that. Can you laser things with your eyes?" "I could try. Maybe I could zap those idiots who refuse to wear their masks properly? "Titus, you can't do that! "
