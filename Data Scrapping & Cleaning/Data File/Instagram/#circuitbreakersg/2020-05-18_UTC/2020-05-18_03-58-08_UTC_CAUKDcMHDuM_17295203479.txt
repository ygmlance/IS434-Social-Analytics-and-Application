Finally made the black bean burger using @itjustmakesmehappy ‘s recipe.

It was a repeat of @dreamersloft17 hamburger buns. I don’t think I’ll ever buy hamburger buns ever again. The softness and freshness of these buns can’t be beat.

I melted tasty cheese over the bun and placed the black bean patty over it, added a smidge of mayonnaise and topped it with caramelized onions. The pickiest eater gave the thumbs up despite it being more or less completely vegan. I think we have a winner here.
