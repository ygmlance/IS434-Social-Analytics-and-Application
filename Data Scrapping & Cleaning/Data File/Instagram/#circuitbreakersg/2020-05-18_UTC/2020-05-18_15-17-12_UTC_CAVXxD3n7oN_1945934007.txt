Singapore Circuit Breaker Day 42
.
.
Second last week of the CB.  Fingers crossed 🤞🏻 .
.
💭What did you achieve during this period? 💭 What did you miss?
.
.
👍🏻 For me, I get to spent more time at home with hubby & Linnet.
👍🏻 I have more time to workout, rest, read, catch up on my Korea drama, sew 👍🏻 My cooking improved, learnt to cook more dishes, double boil soup & some baking
.
.
BUT...
.
.
😂 I missed my parents, siblings and friends
😂 Missed my mum home cooked food,  the yummy food which we cannot travel to eat
😂 Missed travelling, missed our 2nd home 🏠 .
.
Awesome Monday started with preparation of ingredients for boiling soup & dinner then proceed to do my workout before preparing lunch
.
.
Busy but another fruitful day.  Managed to complete 50 minutes of intense workout which I end up screaming... good way to release stress
