Wet on Wet technique by Youtuber - Makoccino & Emily Olson.
Emilyâ€™s tutorial is really fast. I watched it twice before starting but had to rewind, pause still, rewind again to catch up with her speed.
So excited! I have a lot to learn and explore, but first, I need to learn how to draw pine trees. My trees look like sticks with thorns/ prickles!ðŸ˜‚
