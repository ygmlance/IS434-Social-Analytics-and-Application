Hey guys! 👋🏽 We’re just 2 weeks away until the #circuitbreakersg ends! How far we’ve come since April 7th! 💪🏽💪🏽😅
.
We did a little stalking on to see how SG Community is coping during the #stayhome!
.
Share it with us what you’re doing these last weeks, with hashtags #outsideinside & #outsidesg!
.
Just about anything, and we won’t miss to feature you in on our page! 😉💓
