Okay, so I checked the tally and today it is Day 41 of #circuitbreakersg (I hope I did my math right!). These days, aside from plenty of time spent planning meals AND eating them, stalking online supermarkets for available delivery slots, and making sure to do enough to keep the 6 year old centered and connected despite spending way too much time with the tv… I’ve also been doing a fair bit of work helping to transition my church to online platforms. I have always done graphic design, but now I have skills in producing and editing video in my bag too! I guess that’s one blessing that’s come out of staying home. I am been blessed in another way, with these earphones from @sudio.

I’ve been using the Sudio Ett for almost two weeks now - during zoom calls mostly, and listening to music, even as I’m typing this. What’s special about the Ett is the Active Noise Cancelling feature which, as I’m testing right this moment with my kiddo seated right next to me watching a video on the iPad, is really doing what it purports to do: effectively reducing and limiting environmental noises. Pretty impressive job, considering the volume of my music is only around 30%. The only trouble I’m having is getting them to fit more comfortably. I always thought my ears were shaped a little weird! I might just have to experiment more with a different size of ear buds (tips?). Other things I’m enjoying: the sleek, smooth matte finishing and the snap of the magnetic lid. The little things matter to me 😝
