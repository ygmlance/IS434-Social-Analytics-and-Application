The layered painting of the #sunsetsky horizon. Week 6 of #circuitbreakersg has ended. There is hope, all the efforts from everyone is paying off #sgunited 
There have been tragedies and other scenes of ugliness during this period too #aprayer for a time to be grateful, a time to mourn, a time to cry and a time to smile. But let us not forget these times where the community has step up and we are all together in this, what have we learnt or what have we experienced deep down. Grant us perspective dear Lord and not let the voices inside and outside drown out Your voice. There is nothing new under the sun.
