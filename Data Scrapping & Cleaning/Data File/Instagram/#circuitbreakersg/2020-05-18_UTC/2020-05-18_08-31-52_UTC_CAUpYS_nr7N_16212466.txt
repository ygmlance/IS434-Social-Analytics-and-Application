Time for some take-out food when everyone in the family is either having an online meeting or attending an online class. 😎⁣

We ordered Buak Keluak Pork Ribs, Beef Rendang Nasi Lemak, a pizza and some signature wings from @switch_timbrex. Check out their menu, they have quite a good range of items from some finger food, pizzas to local food. 👍🏻👍🏻⁣

Overall it was very tasty and they're pretty generous with the portion too. I understand that all the food from their kitchen has no MSG at all and almost all the items are made from scratch including the rempah, sambal and even achar! 🤩⁣

The one dish that I'm really impressed with is the BUAK KELUAK PORK RIBS by their Peranakan Exec Chef. It was really yummy and it had a good balance of flavours with a nice delicious nutty flavour that was savoury, sweet and also tangy from the Assam. Shiok!! 😋😋😋⁣
