Been growing vegetables at home during the Circuit Breaker and thought to try my hand at some soy beans. To my surprise, with just a couple weeks of growing it sprouted flowers! Swipe to see how young they still are. Itâ€™s crazy how fast they mature (or have they?). Itâ€™s my first time seeing soy bean flowers and these looks so delicate! ðŸŒ¸
