17/05/20 | CB Day 41 - Rainbow salt painting for the boy ðŸŒˆ I havenâ€™t been doing much art & craft with the boy during this CB (Iâ€™m not an arty person). I tend to try to look for easy art ideas. Saw this and decided to let Lincoln try it. Not bad, at least it kept him entertained for a good 20mins.
