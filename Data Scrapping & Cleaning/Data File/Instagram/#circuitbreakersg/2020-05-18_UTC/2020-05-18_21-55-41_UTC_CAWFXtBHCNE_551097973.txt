Less than 14 days left to the end of #circuitbreakersg. Are you all excited? We sure are! We are getting ourselves ready to roll back right in! With #better Mood, Energy and Physique! ðŸ’¡

You can do and experience the same too. We have decided to host a 10-day #breakthecircuit program to help get all of us back on track! I gonna tell you all straight up. We are using @justpruvit Ketones to help us achieve that, in a much easier and faster way than you would ever imagine! Why? Because they Work! ðŸ”Œ

In the next 10 days, you will get personal coaching and daily tips from us with regards to nutrition and daily movements. @paigeisthis and I are certified Precision Nutrition Coaches and I am a certified Personal Trainer for over 15 years. We are here to help! ðŸŽŽ

For the record, we have started our own 10 days 10 km run challenge on 18th May 2020, just so you know we are serious and want to lead by example. Daily updates on our Insta-Stories! No, you are not required to do the same. We are just so charged full of energy and so we decided to do it. You do you! ðŸŽ‡

If you think you don't want to exercise or exercise more, it's fine. We will show you the way around it. If you do, great! If you think you don't want to change your diet, it's OK. We will guide you on how to make it work too. There is a method for everyone! Different strokes for different folks. ðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ
.
So, why not take this opportunity to experience a different and better you, in just 10 days? DM us or comment below if you are up for your possibly most "Life Changing" experience! Or just to ask questions. We are here for you all! As always, remember to keep your body moving people! \m/ðŸ¤™ If you want to know more online, my link is in my bio! Or
