To naturally reduce dust mites with essential oils, I suggest to use lemongrass and lavender in a homemade linen spray. 
Lemongrass essential oil contain a component call Geraniol, which is effective in reducing dust mites. 
Dust mites are primarily found in Beds and a typical mattress may have around 100,000 to 10 million mites inside. A single dust mite produces about 20 waste dropping a day, each containing protein that many people are allergic to. 
Another hot spots where dust mites thrives are found in car - steering wheel, radio, gear shit, cup holders and car seats. 
Simply spray on sheets and hot spots area a few times a day to reduce dust mites.
Enjoy! ğŸŒ±ğŸŒ±ğŸŒ±
