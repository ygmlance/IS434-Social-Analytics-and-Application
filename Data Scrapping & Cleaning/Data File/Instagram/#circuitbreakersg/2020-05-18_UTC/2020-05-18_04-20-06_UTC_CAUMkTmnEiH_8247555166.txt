Matcha Monday with more matcha goodness from @hvala_sg! 💚🍵
✨
Matcha petit gateau (S$8.80) - Matcha sponge, matcha mousse, matcha crumble, matcha glaze. This has got to be the most intense matcha cake I’ve had in Singapore! The matcha notes are prominent and distinct with its characteristic earthy and vegetal tones. Do note that this is quite intense and rich, and thus it may get cloying towards the end. Personally I enjoyed this, but it‘s a tad on the sweeter side for me and I wish there’s more cake and less cream, though the cream isn’t too milky for me thankfully. More bitter, less sweet, less cream - I think it’ll be perfect! But that’s just fussy me and also the fact that I’ve a lighter taste palate 😂. A must try for matcha lovers! 🍰

Matcha mont blanc (S$8.80) - Matcha chestnut paste, chantilly cream, toasted genmaicha, charcoal frangipane. The matcha taste is also distinct in this but I personally find it to be less intense then the matcha petit gateau. The tart shell this time is less firm than the mont noir I’ve had previously, but still maintains a crisp texture to it. I think there’s black sesame in the charcoal frangipane, which adds a nutty aroma to the tart. Personally prefer the mont noir over this! 🥧

Enjoyed the sweet treats so matcha and I got their matcha powder too. Now what should I bake with it? 🤩

Have a lovely week ahead all! 💐
