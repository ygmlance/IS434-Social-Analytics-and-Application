Before this Circuit Breaker period, majority of us were busy with our lives and looking back, we didn't really have much time for ourselves such as preparing a homecook meal for our loved ones or even for oneself. Thus, take this time to appreciate the little things in life and enjoy the time spent with your family at home! 🏡🥢

🍽 Once again, Dad cooked for us dinner! This time, it was none other than the savoury Teochew Bak Kut Teh😋 If you miss eating this outside, you can try making it on your own as it only have a few ingredients — 2 pounds of pork ribs, water, white&black pepper, garlic, salt, star anise, ground cinnamon, soy sauce, cooked rice and voilà you're ready to go! 😄
