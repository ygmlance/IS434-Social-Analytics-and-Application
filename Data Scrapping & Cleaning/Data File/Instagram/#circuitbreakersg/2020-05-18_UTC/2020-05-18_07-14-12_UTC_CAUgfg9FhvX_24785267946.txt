As we practise social distancing during the Circuit Breaker, our hearts should be closer to deal with the challenges ahead. Checking in with your friends goes a long way as you strengthen the friendships, ensuring that your friends know that they are not alone. In return, this act of kindness will help to boost your mood. No act of kindness is ever wasted.⁣

In view of the upcoming kindness day SG by @kindnesssg , share with us on how you stay connected with your friends during the Circuit Breaker!⁣
