As we wind down to sleep each night, why not make it a point to speak blessings over our little ones? Tonight and You Are by @generationclaimed are two of the books that I read most frequently to my 19-month-old. It’s so powerful to declare truth over them, knowing that you are sowing into their spirits, and connecting them to God.
It’s not quite a storybook - each spread features a truth and the Bible verse that it’s based on. And with how deflated I’ll sometimes feel at the end of the day, reading this aloud also grounds me.
Sometimes I’ll read the truth and go to the next page, sometimes I’ll read just the Bible verse, sometimes I’ll read everything...and the kids? They will always enjoy the illustrations with the cute animals. :)
