QOTD: What’s a routine you do to start off your day? 🌸⁣
- For me, I open my curtains wide —> smile, wave and say “hello” to my invisible neighbours from the opposite apartment —> pet my cat —> shower —> if I’m not fasting, I make myself a mug of green tea 🍵 ⁣

Needing to stay at home and practise social distancing can be frustrating, anxiety-inducing, lonely, upsetting, and downright isolating. But it can also be an opportunity to slow down, take stock of things, reflect on the first half of the year, try out things you’ve always wanted to do, and read ✨⁣

Reading has helped to get me through some of my toughest days during this period. But I miss going to libraries and bookstores. If anyone is like me and enjoys the experience of reading physical books, then you’d be feeling very fortunate that we still have the option to buy or borrow books online, when you run out of books to read at home. ⁣

If you prefer buying books, I’d say @bookxcess is a wonderful site to use because their books are often priced at 50-80% of the original price throughout the year, and these are brand new books! They’re based in Malaysia, but they deliver overseas as well. Head on over to their site and find your perfect reads to accompany you through these trying times 💪🏻💖⁣

We may be physically distant now, but I dare say, we have become even more connected than ever before. Make full use of technology now to stay connected with family and friends, whilst also remembering to stay centred. We’ll get through this! 🌷 Sending you all my love 🥰⁣
