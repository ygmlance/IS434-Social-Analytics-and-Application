Today is Circuit Breaker Day 42:
As much as we miss hosting fight events, showcasing our local talents in our boxing ring... these period of Covid-19 has been really tough with no idea when you guys can step into the ring again and for all the gyms to resume operations... ðŸ¥º
.
.
Meanwhile, donâ€™t be discouraged! The day of light will come soon one day, so please continue to stay safe, wear your mask if youâ€™re going out for errands, or continue to stay home and exercise... Watch out for the day when life is back to normal, and the day you can challenge for this @wmomuaythai SG Belt... ðŸ˜Ž
