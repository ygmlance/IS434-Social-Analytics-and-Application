I bend so I don’t break. I bend so I don’t go apeshit on my kids when they are going crazy at home from the #circuitbreakersg . We only started realising this lockdown was affecting our youngest recently. To be honest, it’s affecting all of us as a family. She’s starting to get withdrawn and quiet. Sometimes not knowing what to do with herself. The boys are just going wild and crazy (screaming and picking physical fights - not that it hasn’t happen on a daily basis already but it’s escalated)...it’s insane to juggle work and keep them entertained 😭. Makes me want to pull my hair and scream at them constantly but at the same time I realised they are just as stressed as we are. So now they all have journals that they write in to express their feelings when they are “feeling” and we go out for a bike rides/walks on a daily basis just to get them out for some vitamin D and fresh air. Even that’s not enough...they miss their friends :(. Why you do bend? #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #covid19
