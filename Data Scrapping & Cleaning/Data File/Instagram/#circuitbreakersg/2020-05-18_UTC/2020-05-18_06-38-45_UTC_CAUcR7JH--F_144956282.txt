I haven't had Macdonalds yet.. but I had my much needed haircut @99percenthairstudio last week as hair salons were allowed to reopen for business.

Besides the fabulous cut, I really enjoyed the head massage from @aronthedreamer. 
Looking fresh for our live Bounce sessions on zoom and ready to power through 2 more weeks of Circuit breaker. 💪🏻💪🏻 #selflove #bounceback #haircut #circuitbreakersg #fresh #streetphotography #streetart #grateful #selfcare #covid19 #manbun #99percent #thisiskulture
