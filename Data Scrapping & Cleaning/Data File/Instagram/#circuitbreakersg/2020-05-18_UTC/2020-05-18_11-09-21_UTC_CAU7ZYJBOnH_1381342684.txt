This CB is a good time to reset your relationship with Boba Tea. Why?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you know the following, would you still take Boba Tea (BT) on a regular basis?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1. A 32 oz BT contains 448 calories and 57 gm sugar on the average according to a study by Food Science & Nutrition. This is more than the daily recommended sugar intake 8-11 teaspoons or 32-44 gm by Singapore Health Promotion Board
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
2. The High sugar content and certain colouring and food additives in BT can lead to gaining undesired weight and increase in waistline and tummy area and higher risk of Diabetes Type 2.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
3. Boba or tapioca pearls  can cause digestive problems like constipation due to addition of guar gum to hold the pearls together
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
4. Average cost of a BT is between $4.50 and $6+, about the cost of a meal. While it can fill you up due to the pearls, it actually has little nutrients in it.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you are able to wean off Boba Tea during this CB, it is a good thing ya.
