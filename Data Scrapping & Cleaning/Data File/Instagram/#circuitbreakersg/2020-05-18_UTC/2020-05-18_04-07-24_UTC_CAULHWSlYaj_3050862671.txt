2 more weeks to end of #circuitbreakersg & definitely missing our #fitclub as its my 2nd home.
-
I remember walking into gyms/fitness centers and walking right out, feeling so uncomfortable, not knowing what to do.
-
But I also remember the feeling when I first stepped into this studio. My shy, awkward self was just telling me to stand in one corner & stay away. I remember the coaches there started approaching me, introducing the regular fitclubbers to me, making sure I wasn't feeling left out.

Ultimately, the #highenergy & #passionate people made my whole workout session a whole new different level of experience. -
This is the place where I started my fitness journey, my wellness journey.
This is the place where I grew up to be a better person, physically & mentally. -
But this is also a place where you connect yourself with #likeminded #goaloriented people together.

This is a place where we talk about fun stuffs! Results, Life, Things you love, your job, your hobby, exploring new sports, encourage & motivate one another on a healthier journey, sharing recipes and many more. 🙆🏻‍♀️ ❤️

You'll get better results by coming to the fitclub, not just becuz of the workout, but mainly becuz it strengthens your mindset 💯 which comes from the coach and the community. Just like how I got mine.

If you don't believe, come try it out yourself.✨
