We should've been out and about, but let's hang in there! We're hoping to see you again at our pop-ups really soon when the circuit breaker is lifted in June. ⁠
⁠
Meanwhile, you can still book your wash at our main store- we've been back in action since last week! All you have to do is to book an appointment online and arrange for two way collection and delivery. You'll be able to receive clean and sanitised baby gear over the next few working days.⁠

Visit our link in bio to be directed to our website to make an appointment.⁠
