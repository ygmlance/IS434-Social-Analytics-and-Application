To our fellow Singaporeans and Customers, 
Thank you very much for stepping up and supporting the F&B industry. 
As restaurateurs, our appeal to you is: If you want your dollar to have the most impact in supporting the industry, stop ordering through these platforms. 
Order directly from us - whether it’s for takeaway (remember to wear your mask) or delivery. Many of us have set up our own independent ordering platforms in response to this situation. We are using private hire, courier and taxi drivers who have been left without work. The delivery fees are given to the riders directly, without a middleman. 
Delivery platforms blossomed in a world where convenience was king. The world has changed today. This convenience will cost the survival of restaurants. So we ask you to order direct to #savefnbsg.
