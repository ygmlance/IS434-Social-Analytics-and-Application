Ramly. I never had a Ramly burger till I was in my 20s and dating JW, who introduced me to it. Reason being, it used to be all beef patties and my mother wasnâ€™t the biggest fan of pasar malam food. With the #circuitbreakersg , neighborhood buys are becoming popular and I have never felt more camaraderie with my neighbors than when we all pitch in to meet the minimum spent. #ramlyburger #supper #foodporn
