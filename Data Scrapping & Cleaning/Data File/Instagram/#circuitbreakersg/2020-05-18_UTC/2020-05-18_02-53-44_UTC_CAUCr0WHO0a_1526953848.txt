Somewhere over the rainbow 🌈 .... Amidst global concerns surrounding current healthcare climate, there is a sliver lining ✨💫 We see a new trend of friends and families sending each other food and love ❤️ Heartfelt thanks to @iamangela_ng @mr_marcushanna @chef.simone.sg @miss_queen.c @maxcollection @jlcj19 Kaln Tjioe.
This experience has been most humbling... learning to appreciate the little things in life that we so often take for granted... thankful to be safe at home with loved ones... So keep the spirits up... find calm in the chaos... the sun always shines after a storm 🌈
