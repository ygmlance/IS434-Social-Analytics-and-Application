What a gem of a gin! Brass Lion Distillery’s Singapore Gin is a sheer delight — chock-ful of goodness including torch ginger flowers, pomelo and chrysanthemum. It’s so easy to drink — too easy in fact — I forget it’s alcohol.

You want to sway to Sam Smith after imbibing two glasses or so. Really chill.

On a different but somewhat related note: Embarrassingly, during karaoke with the kids the other night, I searched the karaoke app for “Stan Smith” (when I was thinking Sam Smith). 🤦‍♀️ My tween eyed me with disdain when I LOL-ed at my blunder. This mummy’s cool rating plummeted that night and she had to claw her way back by bluffing her way through Why Don’t We and Billie Eilish hits.
...
Keep calm and drink on.
