Hello Friends! So I have been MIA for the past week and a half, and I have been busy (still) organizing my room. It feels good to have my stuff in their designated locations neat and tidy. Problem is I pack by sections and everytime I clear an area, I create a new mess for the next area 😭

I also have a YouTube channel now, where I post videos to remember snippets of my life in isolation. Link is in bio, if you are interested to see what I have been up to.

I have also been diligently #usingupmystash, but what surprised me is that I actually finished 2 #hairtreatment masks, when honestly my hair is up in a bun all day everyday, I don't know why I still bother to do my 2-step #haircareroutine. Well, at least I have softer #healthyhair in a bun, I guess 😂
P.S. Both #hairmasks I enjoyed 👍🏻
