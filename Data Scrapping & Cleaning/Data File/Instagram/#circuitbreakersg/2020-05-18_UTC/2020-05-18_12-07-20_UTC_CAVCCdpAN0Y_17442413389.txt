We love this description from @sassymamasg of our Dempsey campus and couldn’t say it better ourselves:
.
“Set within a newly-renovated black and white heritage building, the Invictus campus features large classrooms, three large playgrounds AND a swimming pool. There is nothing ‘no-frills’ about it – students are surrounded by lush greenery in one of Singapore’s prettiest spots, which is also conveniently close to Orchard and even the CBD.” - @sassymamasg 🍃🍁🌿
