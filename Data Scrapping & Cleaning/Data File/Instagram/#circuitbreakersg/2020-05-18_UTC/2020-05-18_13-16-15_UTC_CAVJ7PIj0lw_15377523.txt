💦 YAY! #Circuitbreakersg = No swimming pool! No mega huge bath-tub at home, NO problem! Our kiddos are still able to have mega fun!!! We have our very own baby bath-tub from @pukusingapore ! It can comfortably sit Tyra who is #3yearsold (15kg) and chubby Tasha at #7monthsold (9.3kg). The total weight of them both at 24.3kg are only almost a quarter of the 100kg weigh that the stand supporting the Puku bath-tub can actually hold, provided you can fit in it! 😂
.
What I really like about this @pukusingapore baby bath-tub:-
❣️NO backaches! 
The stand supporting the bath-tub is at a level which allows parents to comfortably stand to bathe their lil ones rather than squatting down and bending over to bathe them.
❣️Efficient draining system
Like a normal bath-tub, water from the Puku bath-tub is EASILY and quickly drained by removing the tab at the base of the bath-tub and water will be drained via a rubber tube onto the floor. Swipe left to see video of how efficient the water is drained. You no longer need to manually tilt and flood the bath floor with water at one go. ❣️Space
The Puku bath-tub is wide and spacious, giving our lil ones more room to play and splash 💦! The contouring bath-tub also allows older kids to chill and relax if they wish. Look at how much #bathtime fun these two had with their @pukusingapore bath-tub which is more spacious than the usual baby bath-tubs of other brands.
❣️Rubber handles 
The rubber handles allow for our lil ones to grip firmly without slipping.
❣️Different sizes
The Puku Bath-tub comes in a range of sizes, S, M and L. Depending on what your needs are, you can choose which bath tub suits. We are using the L size bath-tub which fits them both nicely.
❣️Cost friendly
The Puku bath-tub is priced economically and friendly to our wallets and especially so, during this @mummys_market online sale period! Get urs today before the sale ends!
