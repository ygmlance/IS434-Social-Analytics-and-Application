🍜🍲🄱🄰🄺 🄲🄷🄾🅁 🅼︎🅴︎🅴︎ 🅿︎🅾︎🅺︎ 🆃︎🅰︎🅷︎ for dabao again from my usual prawn mee stall on Day 42 CB. Seems like business is brisker today since the prawn🦐 noodles were already sold out by the time I went! The stall owner said most people usually opt for prawn noodles for breakfast and I'm not surprised because it's something I can eat every week too.

If there is one thing that I've learnt from this CB period, it's taught me that no matter how bad things can get, we are still quietly rooting for one another as fellow humans, even if they are familiar strangers.  Because it’s stalls like these which keep our hawker culture alive!

Ok back to my food ramblings. The meepok was yummy of course. I think the portion seemed a little more substantial too. Hehe! 😋
