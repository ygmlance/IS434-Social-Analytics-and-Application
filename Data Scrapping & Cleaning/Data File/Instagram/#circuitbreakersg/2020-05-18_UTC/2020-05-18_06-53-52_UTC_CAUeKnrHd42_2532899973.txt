Mid-day yesterday - Felix tried to ask me to take a nap by staring at me while I was sitting on the seater trying to calm my trail of thoughts and decision. We ended the game with both of us napping. So it was a good ending although I woke up crankier. Felix helps me calm down in many ways. He teaches me to bite as well.
