Anticipation...
The moment you remove the hot lid after the first 20 minutes bake often creates 2 kind of emotions- happiness (seeing a wonderful oven spring) and disappointment (seeing a flat bread). This reminds me of film photography... waiting for the development of the photos and the unknown outcome. Nothing is truly guaranteed. ‘The idea of waiting for something makes it more exciting’

Andy Warhol
