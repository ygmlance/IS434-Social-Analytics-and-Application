First #haircut in these #COVID19 times... in #Singapore, you have to get your temperature checked & scan a QR code to log your information (National ID etc) in — & wear a mask of course. This was also my first haircut in Singapore in a very long time — I loved Elmay who cut my hair at @salonatgoldhill. I’d recommend her. #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker
