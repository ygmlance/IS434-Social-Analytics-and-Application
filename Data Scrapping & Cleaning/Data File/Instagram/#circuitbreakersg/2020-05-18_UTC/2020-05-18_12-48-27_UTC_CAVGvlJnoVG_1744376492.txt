Today marks the first achievement I managed to unlock during this #circuitbreakersg period. I started my 1st virtual group Sleep Baby Sleep coaching program.⁣
⁣
I have not done this before because all this while it’s always been more 1-1 personalised consultations. ⁣
⁣
Well like they always say, never say never. There’s always a first time. :)⁣
⁣
I spent 2.5 hours going through my 5 simple steps to better night’s sleep and answering all the sleep questions asked by this lovely group of mommies all with babies from 2 months old to 12 months old. If you are a part of the group and reading this post, thanks for being my pioneer group. :)⁣
⁣
It’s definitely quite a change from my usual 1-1 sessions but I think it’s really nice that all the mommies get to learn from one another.⁣
⁣
If you have missed out on this first group coaching program and would love to join my next one, please comment below or DM me. Maybe the next one I can open up to mommies with toddlers!⁣
