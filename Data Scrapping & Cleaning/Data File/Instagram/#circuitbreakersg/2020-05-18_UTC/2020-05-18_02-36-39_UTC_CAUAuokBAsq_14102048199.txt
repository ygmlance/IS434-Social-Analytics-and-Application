Children learn best when they’re having fun. That’s why @themastertheoremgames created Proof!, an award-winning card game that helps players to sharpen their mental math skills.

How to play
Recommended for ages 9+, this fast-paced game comes with a range of number cards from 0 to 100. To begin, the dealer arranges nine cards in a 3×3 layout (Photo #2) and players have to link three or more cards to form an equation. These cards are kept by the player and new cards are drawn until the deck runs out. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.

Suitable for P1 kids too
I played this game with my P1 son initially using only 0-20 number cards. He quickly got the hang of it though and challenged me to increase the playing deck using number cards up to 40, 60, 80 and eventually 100. To make things easier, I added an extra column of cards so we could form more solutions in a 3×4 layout (Photo #3). My son had just learned about number bonds in school so Proof! was a great way to reinforce what he had learned and stretch his application.

My K2 son also pleasantly surprised me by forming simple equations with numbers from 0-10. Typically, he insisted on joining the game with his elder brother and used his toes to count before collapsing in mock exhaustion... #homegames #sgdad #sgdaddy #sgmummy #sgmum #themastertheoremgames #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #math #mathisfun #cardgame #cardgames #cardgamereview #cardgamereviews
