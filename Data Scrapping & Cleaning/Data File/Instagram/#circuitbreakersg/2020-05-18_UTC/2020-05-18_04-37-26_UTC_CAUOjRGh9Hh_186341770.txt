It's been like the 7th week since the lockdown! During this 6 weeks, I have done things that I thought I couldn't... for example, staying at home not going anywhere, facing the computer screen  everyday to teach, learn new delivery styles and overcome challenges to engage learners over online platforms. 🥰👍🏻

I believe we are coming to the end of tunnel... started to see lights coming. We can do this and will overcome! ♥️👍🏻

Because bad weather wont last forever! 😍🙏🏻

Have a beautiful week ahead. ♥️👍🏻
