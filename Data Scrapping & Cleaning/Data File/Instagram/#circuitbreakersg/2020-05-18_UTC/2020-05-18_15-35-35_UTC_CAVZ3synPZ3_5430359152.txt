Had a hard time trying to achieve the colours for those mountains. 
Wet on Wet technique by Youtuber - Emily Olson.

Colours she mentioned - cobalt violet light hue and permanent magenta; purple and ultramarine for those mountain in the middle; purple and indigo for the mountain right in front.
Since my palette does not contain the colours she mentioned except for ultramarine, I coloured them with my Caran Dâ€™Ache colour pencils once the paint is dry.
