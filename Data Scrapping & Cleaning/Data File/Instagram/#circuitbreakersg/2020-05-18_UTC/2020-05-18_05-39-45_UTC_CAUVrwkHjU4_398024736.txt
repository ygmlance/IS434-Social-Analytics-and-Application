We’ll make mistakes but if we listen to the truth that’s inside us, even when it’s hard, even when its inconvenient, people will notice. They’ll gravitate towards us. And we’ll be part of the solution instead of part of the problem. - Barack Obama's speech to the High School Graduands of 2020.

Well said! ... Drastic times calls for drastic measures. Its not the time to keep talking about the problems. It's time for humanity to come together and derive solutions. This pandemic has reset our society to zero but our nation is always built on generations that evolve, learn from the mistakes of the previous generations and build greater societies and stronger communities. Keep this spirit going and we will come back stronger than before!
