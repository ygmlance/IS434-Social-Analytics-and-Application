Braised pork
üìùBraised pork is super convenience when I am working from home. It takes short time to prepare, put it to smart cooker or on stove, then you can continue all you need to do and the dish is just ready by the time you want to have it
üìùYou can cook as big pot as you like, and is the dish that will become more tasty after keeping overnight (keep it in fridge of course)

Ingredient: three layer pork (about 300g), toufu, dried yellow toufu skin, dried mushroom soak overnight, egg

‚ù∂ Marinate pork with corn flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of dark soya sauce, 1 tablespoon of light soya sauce, minced garlic and slices of ginger. Keep for 1 hour or overnight is fine
‚ù∑ Boil egg and remove shell. Soak dried toufu skin in water and keep for use later.
‚ù∏ Slice shallots and add it into the pot. Add marinated pork, toufu and egg. Add water that soaked mushroom and top up with water to the level covering all the ingredients.
‚ùπ Add another 1 tablespoon of dark soya sauce, 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of light soya sauce. Then put it to slow cook mode or cook on the stove. My slow cook mode is 1.5 hours. ‚óÜ If you are cooking on stove, half covered to pot to prevent overflow. I have tried stove version and it will take about 1.5 hours too with lowest fire but need to watch out to prevent drying off. If it is drying too fast, means your fire is still too big so need to turn down. If it is drying, just top up with water and continue till 1.5 hours
‚ù∫ 20 minutes before done, add in soft toufu skin and continue to cook
‚ùª Ready to serve when time is up ‚ö†Ô∏è If you have left over gravy from braised pork please don‚Äôt discard away because I have the next recipe coming up to use the gravy for a really simple yet tasty meal
