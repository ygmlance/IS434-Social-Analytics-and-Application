#circuitbreakersg day 42

A simple chocolate cake for my mum’s birthday today. 🤗 ❤️ .
.
.
We are exactly 2 weeks to the end of circuit breaker. Things will not go back to the same as before and we will have to get used to the new normal even after circuit breaker. .
.
.
But with delivery services, we will still be able to send our 💕 to our loved ones despite the social-distancing measures. And I’m grateful for that today. #gratitudediary
