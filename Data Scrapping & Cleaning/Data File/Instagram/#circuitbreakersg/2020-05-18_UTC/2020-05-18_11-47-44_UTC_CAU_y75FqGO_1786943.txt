Was doing my usual YouTube routine and after seeing @gabiekook 's recent video where she made maple garlic korean wings I knew I had to try it as well! ⁣

Guys, this recipe is a life changer! No deep frying required and you still get the crispiness! ⁣
⁣
The sauce was made using soy sauce, maple syrup, a dash of cinnamon powder and some garlic! Oooooooh, so good! ⁣
⁣
Serve with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and pair with some beer for the best chimaek experience at home!
