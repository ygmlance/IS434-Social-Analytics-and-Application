Day 14 Hols = Day 42 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Arnold Press with Split Stance
1.5 Sumo Squat
#7dayarmchallenge #7dayarmschallenge with #blogilates 
Today is strength training and back to Hasfit workouts and today was intense! Decided to film 2 videos: 1 on lower body and 1 upper body (while I had some strength) 
And I decided to join back to the @blogilates 1 week challenges and this week is Arms. My arms are huge, so I hope it can get toned and strong. Whether it can get smaller, I'm really not sure.. Watch the IG stories to see my progress... Happy Monday! (btw, I'm clearing out the last bit of the study room. Today, got to focus on work already)
