Prolly the most labour-intensive meal I’ve ever cooked thou’ it took me only 𝟏𝟓 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐬 to cook the crispy HCG patty and assemble this burger.⁣⁣

I don’t know what came over me yesterday night to attempt making the charcoal burger buns from scratch. I was like: “Aiya, just throw everything into the bread maker and let it do its job. Shouldn’t be difficult.” Alas, life has its own plans and my under-utilised break maker died on me. Was left with a messy, sticky dough and I had two options - throw it or try to salvage it. I chose the latter and I regretted almost immediately. The sticky dough was so hard to work with and it took me an hour or more to knead into a manageable, smooth and elastic dough. And it took another 2 hours for proofing. By the time I was done with baking the buns, it was already past midnight.⁣ ⁣

Was it really worth the trouble to make the buns from scratch? Yes, ONLY IF using a bread maker or electric mixer with hook attachment. Will never try kneading a bread dough by hand again. 🙅‍♀️⁣⁣
