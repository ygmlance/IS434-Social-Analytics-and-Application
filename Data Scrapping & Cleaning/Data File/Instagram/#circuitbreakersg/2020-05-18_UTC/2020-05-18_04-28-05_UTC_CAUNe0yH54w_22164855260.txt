The colours and freshness of a brand new week in this simple bowl.  Our Pico de Gallo tells a story of culinary passion, nutritional health and #CantinaCulture friendships that go into the food we serve and eat. Who wants to learn how to make it?
.

Made from scratch, Vatos Cantina Pico de Gallo is full of health benefits with only the freshest ingredients of veggies and herbs used. Armed with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, the onions and garlic in the sauce prevent the hardening of your arteries, fight bacteria and protect against heart disease. Mix this with ripe tomatoes, cilantro, hand-squeezed lime juice and a kick of Jalapeno and you have the perfect compliment to any taco. Take care of yourselves in this time everyone and remember to eat, drink & chill. .
