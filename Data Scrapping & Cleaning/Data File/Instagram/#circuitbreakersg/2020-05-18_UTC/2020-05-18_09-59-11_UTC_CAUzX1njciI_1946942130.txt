Be it the additional smoky flavour or the retention of flavourful juices, dishes served in claypots, somehow taste better. Weâ€™ve collated a list of claypot delivery services for you to enjoy from home. Kim Keat Hokkien Mee serves a formidable Claypot Hokkien Mee ($10) which is infused with wok hei, and can feed up to three people. Qi Xiang Chicken Pot tops our list with their impeccable service. They deliver everything from the claypot to the portable stove for a complete chicken hotpot experience. You can also order homey dishes from Lau Wang Claypot Delights such as Sesame Chicken ($5.80) and spicy Sambal Seafood ($9.50).
