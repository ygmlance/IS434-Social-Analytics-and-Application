Time to update my progress! 
Today is the 28th day of my self challenge headstand and I am still finding my balance of the pose. The last one week, I have been practicing on basics and listening to my body during my practices.
.
Today my focus is on my control of each motion of my pose, not focusing on straightening my legs up. Target is to go up and down or repeatedly with control with 3 different entries.
.
You can see I did better at the beginning with curl-up. My 1st left split-leg was okay, but my core muscle started “screaming” at my right split-leg 😅and the last pike-up version was totally out of control at the end 😆
.
Still have a lot of rooms to improve! However, I do feel my body is stronger than last week and I have slightly better control of the pose today than 7 days ago.
.
We all have our own pace, there is no need to rush. If we aim for long term, it is important to build a strong foundation before we reach higher goals, so your achievements will be sustainable 😉
