I'm delighted with tonight's dinner. Cos I haven't had japanese food for quite awhile 😂. Ordered mine @keikaisendon.sg that serves delicious rice bowls topped with fresh sashimi from the seas of Japan 🇯🇵.⁣
⁣
I had the Mentaiyaki Kaisendon. You can see how loaded my bowl is with the creamy yummy roe 😋. I cleaned up my bowl really quick.. 👍🏻⁣
