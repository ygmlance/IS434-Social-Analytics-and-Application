18/05/20 | CB Day 42 | HBL Day 23 - Another brand new week. Lincoln working on this weekâ€™s HBL worksheets on the iPad. With the introduction of iPad, the boy is getting more screen time! That explains why I got him a pair of blue light glasses. He looks so grown up with the pair of glasses! So charming, especially when he is really focusing on his work ðŸ’•
