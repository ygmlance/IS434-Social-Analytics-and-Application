DIRECTIONS:
1. Add one tablespoon of salt into a pot of boiling water, then add spaghetti sticks. Gently bend the sticks into the pot. Boil for around 7 to 9 minutes until al dente (taste one strand to test).
2. Set aside one cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.
3. Add garlic to cold oil in pan, and cook until the garlic just begins to turn golden brown.
4. Add pork belly slices and squids into pan, and stir-fry until almost fully cooked.
5. Add the rest of the ingredients into pan and stir-fry.
6. Add the drained pasta, 1.5 tablespoons of tom yum paste and some pasta water (for flavour and to dissolve the paste) into the pan, and toss well.
