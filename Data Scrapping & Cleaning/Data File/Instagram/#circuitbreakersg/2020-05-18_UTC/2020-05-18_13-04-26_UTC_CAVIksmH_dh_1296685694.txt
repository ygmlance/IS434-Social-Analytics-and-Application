Signature original BBQ ribs & Quesadilla re-plated at home on wood serving board for a pleasant dining. 😊(go to my IG story to see before re-plating).

Simply love these fall-off-the-bones pork ribs with a secret marinade that’s cooked low and slow for that tender and flavorful ribs! It’s 💯% satisfactory! .

The Bro Bruce Quesadilla is deliciously served with ranch dip. I reheated it using the airfryer and enjoyed the crisped tortilla with soft melted cheddar cheese and juicy pulled pork much! 😋😋👍.

Meat N’ Chill is my to-go place whenever I crave for some good BBQ Ribs. They boasts about their signature pork ribs as the "meanest ribs in town" perfected by Chef Bruce. They also offer a selection of flame-grilled steaks. When they open for dine-in again, I’ll be sure to go back with my foodie buddies! 😍
