Last week I experimented on steamed lapis sagu but something was bugging me about it. The lapis sagu I remember having when I was a kid was softer and there was more "spring" to each bite. So it was back to the drawing board again for this. After a good attempt searching, I found an old recipe that uses 4 different flours as opposed to only 2. Luckily I managed to find the other 2 flours in a dried goods store within the market last weekend (no easy feat finding flour nowadays during the circuit breaker and over hari raya, trust me!). This 4 flour recipe is definitely a keeper! Now I am finally happy. ðŸ¤­.
