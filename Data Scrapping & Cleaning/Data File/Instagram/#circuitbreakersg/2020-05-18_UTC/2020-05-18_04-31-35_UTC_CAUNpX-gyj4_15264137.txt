Robertson Quay has always been a hip and popular place for those staying nearby, havelock and tiong bahru areas, even on weekday mornings🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️.
During this CB period, best to avoid the more crowded evenings, unless looking out for the lady seen flashing recently near Great World City underpass 🤣🤣😅
