Tonight we had some quintessential Chinese dishes from #paradiseclassic (@paradisegrpsg) â€” crispy prawn rolls, roast chicken (with "keropok"), minced pork with salted egg, tomato with scrambled eggs and seafood vermicelli. Definitely feeling satisfied, with some leftovers for our next meal!

P. S. Also had our favorite #paradisedynasty for delivery recently, but forgot to take photos!
