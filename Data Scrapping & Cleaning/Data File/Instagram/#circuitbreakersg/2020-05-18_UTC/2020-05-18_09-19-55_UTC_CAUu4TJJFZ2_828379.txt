WFM and HBL is not an easy task especially when Royce and Ryo need 100% attention from us. Luckily, the teachers from My First Skool have prepared HBL materials on a weekly basis to keep the boys occupied and able to continue learning even during this critical period. This will allow parents who WFH to have a peace of mind as well!

As requested by Royce‚Äôs teacher, we did a short video of preposition to share with his other classmates so that they can learn from one another üòç. The video was then edited by his teacher and uploaded onto the parent portal app. Royce was happy yet shy when he knew that his video will be shared to other fellow parents and his classmates üòÇ. While recording this video, Royce has also mastered all the different prepositions as well, knowing how to use them correctly. So proud of him!
