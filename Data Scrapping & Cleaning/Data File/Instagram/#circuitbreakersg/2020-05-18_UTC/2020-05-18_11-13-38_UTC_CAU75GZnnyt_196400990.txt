Dinner this evening, was something that was put together with various bits and pieces found in the fridge, combined to become a Curry Fried Rice with Chicken Cubes! Square cut white onions, minced garlic and lard cubes were fried in lard, beaten egg was added, and just before it was set, refrigerated leftover rice from last week was added and the mixture stirred well. Several squirts of fish sauce was added, then cubed fishcakes and cubed chicken chop from last Thursday was added, and mixed well with the rice. The extra packet of Southern Indian Fish Curry gravy from Saturdayâ€™s Roti Prata was then added into the frying rice and mixed well, in two batches. Chopped Kai Lan, or Chinese Kale was added and folded into the frying rice, with a final liberal sprinkling of freshly ground white pepper finishing off the whole operation. The fried rice was tasty, had a distinct curry flavour, but hardly any heat! Satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #curryfriedricewithchicken #nowastecooking #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
