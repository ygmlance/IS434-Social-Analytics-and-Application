Whatever makes you feel the sun from inside out, chase that

We get that due to Circuit Breaker, this year’s Hari Raya would be celebrated rather differently - a quiet one in our homes instead of gatherings with family and friends. But take heart and hang in there as we do our part for Singapore! 
We’d love to make it easier for you to celebrate family and friends - we’re offering 10% off our woven Bags (handmade by nomadic tribes in Sarawak) and free local delivery for any purchase above $80 till the end of the month! 
Our bags come in different sizes and are waterproof and come in an array of chic looking colors - perfect for a trip to the Supermarket or Pasar, we hope that our bags add a pop of color and cheer during this CB lockdown. 
DM us to place your order and details on dimensions!
