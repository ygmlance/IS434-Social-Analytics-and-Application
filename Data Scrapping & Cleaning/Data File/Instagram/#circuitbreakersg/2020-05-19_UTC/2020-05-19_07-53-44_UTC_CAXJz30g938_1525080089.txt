Finally found a banana bread recipe worth keeping! Love the rich & dark color #nofilterneeded So so similar with the ones sold at Woolworth Oz 😋😋 the key is to freeze & thaw the mashed banana before baking it 👍🏼 #homebake #smellssogood #whattobake #theitrecipe #stayathomeandbake #circuitbreakersg #stayathomeforsg
