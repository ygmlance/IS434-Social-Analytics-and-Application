The fluffiest, bubbliest, crispiest scallion pancake made with discarded sourdough starter :) thanks @lifebymikeg for the fab idea. Looking forward to making this on the reg and drizzling it with chilli oil and making perfect dipping sauces to go with it... ooof. ⁣

I'll be documenting my sourdough journey soon. My starter (his name is Bruce) is sitting next to me while I'm working, and I can hear him burping. I now see the appeal in the sourdough lockdown trend - Bruce feels like a cute little pet. He is as needy and dependent, but at least he doesn't make too much noise or pee everywhere ❤️ also Bruce makes excellent scallion pancakes. Let's see your dog do that ⁣
