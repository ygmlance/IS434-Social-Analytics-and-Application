Sonny Clark - Sonny’s Crib, 1957. Another album with serious heavyweights in the lineup. Sonny Clark has a brief but prolific career as a jazz pianist. Having worked with Oscar Pettiford and Sonny Rollins, he was soon part of the Blue Note stable. Sonny’s Crib was his second album as lead. Coltrane was on fire on this album which was recorded just weeks before Blue Train. None of the players disappoint on this record. Worth exploring his small discography, he would have been a household name had he not died at just 31.  #sonnyclark #sonnyscrib #curtisfuller #donaldbyrd #johncoltrane #paulchambers #arttaylor #bluenoterecords
