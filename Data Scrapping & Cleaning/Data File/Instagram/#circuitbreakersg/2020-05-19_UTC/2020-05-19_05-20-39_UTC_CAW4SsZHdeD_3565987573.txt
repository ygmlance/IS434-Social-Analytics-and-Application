So what did I do to the two other #crossiants that I baked this morning? Why I had them for #lunch off course! I made a #smokedsalmon #crossiant #sandwich with #cremefraiche and #avocado ; and a #ham and #avo sandwich with #trufflebutter ! They were sooooo #yummy and #satisfying ! #tastytuesday #latergram #stayhome #sgunited
