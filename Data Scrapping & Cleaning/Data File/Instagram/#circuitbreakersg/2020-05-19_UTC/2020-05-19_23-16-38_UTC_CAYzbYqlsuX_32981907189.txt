throwback part 2 - our friends & i, drove in our personal lorries, vans & cars to deliver necessities to the ones in need! seeing the gratefulness & appreciation as we handed them the packages, made all our sweat and tiredness fade away. it was also our first time doing this, it truly left us all with a sentimental memory that i'd always remember.💙 // DM or click the link in the bio to get in touch with us now!❤️ // #courier #courierservice #delivery #deliveryservice #singapore #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #couriersg #deliverysg #smalllocalbusiness #singaporelocalbusiness #ramadan #puasa #iftar #ramadan2020 #ramadansingapore
