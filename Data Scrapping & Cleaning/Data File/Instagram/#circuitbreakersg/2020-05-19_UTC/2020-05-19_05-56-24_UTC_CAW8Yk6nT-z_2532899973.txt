Tuesday downtime break: No knead bread. NOT SOURDOUGH! I prep the dough yesterday evening and baked it today. Do note all this is done without putting the mixture into the fridge. Yes itâ€™s not sourdough but itâ€™s a start if you wanna try to make some â€˜artisanal breadâ€™ .

I was kinda skeptic on this but after a few experience with runny mixture with my sourdough journey, this was nothing ðŸ¤£ Experience does make you stronger somehow. This mixture sat out for about 16 hours. Do give a Google and youâ€™d find a few recipes for this. I used one from Jo Cooks on Google. Every recipe seems the same except for the amount of salt used. .
