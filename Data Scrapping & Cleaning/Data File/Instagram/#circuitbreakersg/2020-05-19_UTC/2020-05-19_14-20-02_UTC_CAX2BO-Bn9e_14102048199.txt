Some children can grow self-conscious of their looks when their baby teeth start to fall. A parent of my son's classmate once lamented how her child stopped smiling at the camera for months to hide the gap between her teeth. Looking back, I'm grateful that my son never lost his adorable smile throughout this rite of passage for every little boy and girl.

Prior to this change, I had read several simple stories about teeth loss with my son. One book that stood out for me is Smile by @armourpublishing. Written by students from @singaporepoly, the subject is told charmingly from the child's perspective without ever sounding condescending. If you have a five or six year old, why not check out this book from @nationallibrarysg?
