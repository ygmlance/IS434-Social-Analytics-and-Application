STRAWBERRY SUMMER CAKE 
Baking is therapy for me ! And filming the whole process would have been too distracting . Clicked exactly these photos to document it . Baked after a long time today and the result was not that bad at all ! 
RECIPE 
6 tbspns unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for pie plate
1 1/2 cups  all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon table salt
1 cup + 2 tablespoons granulated sugar(for strawberries)
1 large egg
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pound strawberries, hulled and halves

Preheat oven to (180 C)350°F. Butter a 10-inch pie pan or 9-inch deep-dish pie pan . This cake does not work in a standard 9-inch pie pan; it will overflow. This cake would work, however, in a 9- or 10-inch springform or cake pan.
Whisk flour , baking powder and salt together in a small bowl. In a larger bowl, beat butter and 1 cup sugar until pale and fluffy with an electric mixer, about 3 minutes. Mix in egg, milk and vanilla until just combined. Add dry mixture gradually, mixing until just smooth.
Pour into prepared pie plate. Arrange strawberries, cut side down, on top of batter, as closely as possible in a single layer. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sugar over berries!Bake cake for 10 minutes then reduce oven temperature to(160C) 325°F and bake cake until golden brown and a tester comes out free of wet batter, about 50 minutes to 60 minutes. (Gooey strawberries on the tester are a given.) Let cool in pan on a rack.  Cut into wedges. Serve with lightly whipped cream , if you want some more decadence beat some cream cheese along with the whipped cream with some castor sugar ( depends on how sweet you want it). The cake is as it is sweet enough.
