Oh wow! Nothing tastes as good as a #freshlybaked #croissant in the #morning ! And no... I didn’t make them from scratch lol! I bought some frozen raw #croissants and pop them into the oven at 180’C for 18min and #voilà ... #freshbaked #bread to be eaten during #circuitbreakersg ( #lockdown )! I had one warm with butter ! #yum #delish #breakfast #latergram #stayhome #sgunited
