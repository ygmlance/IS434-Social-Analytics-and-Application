The Wed 8pm Myofascial Release class will address TENNIS ELBOW. The whole WFH situation is showing up some repetitive stress issues and tennis elbow is one of them, if your workdesk situation isn’t ideal. Besides the localised pain in the elbow, you would also experience a significant loss of strength in the forearm, so an everyday task like picking up a bag of groceries or reaching across the dining table to pick up a glass of water are suddenly incredibly difficult. If you’ve been lying in bed holding your phone or tablet and netflixing for hours, or holding your elbows constantly at a bend that is less than 90 degrees for hours for work, or you’ve taken on a new crafty hands on hobby like crochet or drawing, or hand whisking dalgona coffee or rolling your own boba and you have not used your hands that way for a while, you might have given yourself tennis elbow. Anyway, class is at 8pm, it’s a 90min session and $15. You will need a tennis ball/lacrosse ball/massage ball. Let me know if you want in. #tenniselbow #wfhlife #circuitbreakersg #telecommuting #myofascialrelease #triggerpoint #tensionrelief
