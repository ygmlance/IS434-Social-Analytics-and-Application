The idea for this artwork came about when we saw a FB post that was talking about how nature continues to thrive while humans now have to stay at home due to COVID-19. Humans are like little chess pieces on this planet Earth who try to create a sense of belonging with the things we do and the things we build. Now we are vulnerable to COVID-19 and it probably is a timely reminder that nature can take back their territory on Earth anytime. What are your thoughts about COVID-19? (Artwork by Art Senze).
