#7dayarmchallenge #7dayarmschallenge with #blogilates 
Today my son joined me (by watching and sucking). Haha.. Super tired from yesterday as I tried to clear my last (ok 2nd last batch) of decluttering, woke up later. But on Day 2 of the arms challenge and happened that Heather Robertson's workout for May was ALSO ARMS. I really need a good stretch after. 
Need to get my engine back to work as well. Why holidays ending so fast. Haha.. #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
