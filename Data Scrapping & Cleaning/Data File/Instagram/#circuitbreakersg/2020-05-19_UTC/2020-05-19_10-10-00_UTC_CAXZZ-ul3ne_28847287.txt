Rose Milk Tea 🥀☕️
⠀⠀
I put in heaps of quality rose tea leaves just to make sure I can taste the flavour ☺️ If you want to some rose milk tea for your own, recipe here because sharing is caring 📝:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1. Bring 400ml milk to a boil before turning off the heat
2. Add in 4 tablespoons of loose rose tea leaves (I used TWG) & cover to let simmer
3. Stir in 1 tablespoon of condensed milk
4. Enjoy!!! 🤪
