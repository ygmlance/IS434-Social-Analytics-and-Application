We collectively create the meaning of time—it has no predetermined meaning until we give it meaning. To say that something, like time, is a social construction is not to say that it doesn't exist or it is merely an illusion, but instead that humans have created systems of meaning that creates the concept of time.⁠

Time is what we create it to be. How & what we use it for. And that action can form lifelong habits. If I am not careful, I'll develop wrong habits over time. That determines my future.⁠

A few years back, I made a mental note of a friend who was always bullet journaling with the neatest characters, with precision layout & alignment. Many years later, what was mere vanity bullet journaling to me, was her honing a skill quietly. Her persistence gave her the ability in later years to whimp up a perfect poster or layout with limited everyday stationary. Her posters could be easily mistaken for a computer generated copy. She was by now, thoroughly trained with very steady hands⁠.⁠
⁠
I was careless in forming my opinions too quickly. But more importantly, this exemplifies the power of the mind over time. Time used effectively produces lasting results. One small steady consiciencious effort over time hones any skill. It gives us meaning as human beings. This is how craftspeople become who they are, with singleminded focus and tenacity. ⁠

Maybe all this time at home is driving me crazy.⁠ Introspecting and restropecting. It is doing me a tonne of good though. ⁠In the midst of juggling all my activities during #circuitbreakersg, I'd like to embrace different ideas and choices. And accept the idea of 'to each his own'.⁠ ⁠
