Back when I could still leisurely chill inside a cafe, read my book, drink my coffee and selfie. 😂(don't judge me, you probably did that too hahaha)

2020 would probably be remembered as a year of maximum 宅-ness and record breaking of takeaways/food deliveries ordered for many of us.

Gambate! Anyway, since SG housing is so expensive, spending more time at home actually makes it cheaper per hour, if you look at this way! 😂 (akin to justifying high usage of branded stuff)
