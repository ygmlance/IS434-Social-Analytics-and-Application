Day 43/56â€¢Stayhome TB post 
Saw this photo on FB so throwback here ðŸ˜€ I still remember this was made for Lil K as pre-swimming lesson snackbox....6 years ago! It was a rare sight to see inarizushi appearing in his decobens cos it was his least fav type of sushi then ðŸ˜” and still, his least preferred sushi now. Ain't kids supposed to like these sweet beancurd pouches? Haha!
