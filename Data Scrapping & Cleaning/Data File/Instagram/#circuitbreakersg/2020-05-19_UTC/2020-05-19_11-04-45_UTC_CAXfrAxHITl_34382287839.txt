“I believe a movement can be started by anyone, you just need to take the first steps to get there. We’re a small team of 4 and with the help of an amazing network of friends, we’ve put this together in an incredibly short period of time. What motivates me everyday is going out there and meeting people on the ground, hearing how these meals and treats are lifting the spirits of migrant friends and healthcare heroes across the island :)” - Ling Quek- @lingquek
