【Recipe】Burgers and roasted vegetables for dinner🍔🍠🥔 Not exactly fast food but definitely satisfied our cravings for it 😂🙈 #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
Made both Spicy Fried chicken cutlet burger and Double cheese Wagyu beef patties. Served over home baked potato milk soft burger buns. 
No knead potato milk buns are so soft and spongy, plus it took me no time to make them. Tastes great with both chicken and beef too. 
And I’m so happy the beef patties turn out so juicy, so yums! And using the cheese to “seal” the patties does help too. 
Do check out my IGS to see how I make these burger buns. Also sharing the easy recipe below. #honeybeebakespotatomilkbuns #nokneadpotatomilkbuns

Makes 8 
150g peeled, cubed potatoes
220ml fresh milk
Add 6g instant active yeast
25g caster sugar
25g vegetable oil
320g bread flour
15g salted butter, melted 
Method 
1) Steam the potatoes till cooked. Then mash it. 
2) Gradually add the milk to mash potatoes and mix well
3) Add sugar, oil and yeast into the milk mixture. Combine. 
4) Add in bread flour. Then just using the rubber spatula to combine dough till it comes together to a soft pliable dough. No kneading needed. 
5) Cover to let proof in the mixing bowl for 2 hrs or till it doubled. 
6) After 2 hours, sprinkle a little flour and pull out dough on a floured work surface. Punch out air and divide into 8 portions. 
7) Using minimal flour, roll dough potions flat, then into Swiss roll. Repeat once more and then roll round. Place on baking tray to proof. Repeat for all portions. 
8) Preheat oven to 180°C and brush the buns with melted butter. Sprinkle sesame seeds and bake for 15-18 mins till golden brown. 
9) Let cool on rack before slicing. Butter toast them and serve with your favourite protein. Or with cold butter would be lovely too. Enjoy!
