Happy Tuesday! Here in Singapore we’re hoping that we’re in the final stretch for the #circuitbreakersg 
My son’s preschool teacher says they are getting tested and preparing to go back to school at the beginning of June. Although no official word yet about reopening. Everyone has everything crossed. 
The government is playing very safe. There are still high a lot of workers testing positive in the foreign worker dormitories. But a few things reopened last week. So we’ll see what the coming week brings.

I imagine we’ll have to wear masks everywhere for some time to come. And have to check in and out of everywhere on our phones. 
As well as looking forward to schools and businesses reopening I am launching a month long journaling challenge on June 1st. Link is in my bio. I ran this once three (!) years ago and I was really feeling like this is something we need again this June.
