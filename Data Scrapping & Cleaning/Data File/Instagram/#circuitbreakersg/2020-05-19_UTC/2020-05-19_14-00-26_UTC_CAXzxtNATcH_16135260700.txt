New people, separation anxiety and other unfamiliar happenings can often leave our furry pal a little #jittery. Establishing a safe corner of comfort with a simple command like 'go to place' can help alleviate the initial stress or overexcitement! How to do this? Our pet behaviourist experts at @happytailsasia suggest putting your pet's bed in one spot and train them to 'go to place' as part of your daily routine, and your dog will naturally go back to their safe spot during high-stress moments too.
