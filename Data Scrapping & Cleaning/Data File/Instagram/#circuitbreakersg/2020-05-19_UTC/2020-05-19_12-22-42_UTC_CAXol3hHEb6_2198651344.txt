[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Supporting a nearby restaurant @PietroItalian_SG and ordering in their Pizza Fungi (S$21.30)! Am glad that it arrived warm, though the thin crust could be a little crispier. Actually all food are best eaten hot, right on the spot. Who else is counting down to the end of Circuit Breaker? ðŸ˜‹
.
PS: Pietro is now offering 1-for-1. So silly of us to have missed out on that promo! ðŸ˜‚
