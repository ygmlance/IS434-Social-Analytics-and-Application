We are just as excited as you are, and hopeful for a possible resumption of chemical services, such as hair coloring, treatment, perming and straightening, in June.

As we await further information related to new industry guidelines, restrictions, and protocols to be put in place prior to the resumption, our top priority still remains the health and safety of our team and our guests.

For now, you may continue to reach us by phone or email to prebook appointments in June for chemical services. If there are any changes, we will contact you again to reschedule the appointments.

While we continue to receive an overwhelming amount of messages regarding bookings and appointments, we sincerely want to thank you, our valued clients, for your ongoing loyalty and patience.
