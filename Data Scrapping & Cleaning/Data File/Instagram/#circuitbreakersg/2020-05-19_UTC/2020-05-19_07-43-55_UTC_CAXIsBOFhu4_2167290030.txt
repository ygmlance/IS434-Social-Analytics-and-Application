DAY 42, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
Chatpate Namak Paare
This Savoury snack for tea-time is an Indian favourite. I had made these for someone sometime ago, and was craving these myself. My son likes these too, so decided to make it. 
Make a firm dough with ....
300g flour (maida)
4 tbsp ghee (clarified butter)
3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp caraway seeds (ajwain)
1/2 tsp chaat masala
1/2 tsp coriander pwd (dhania pwd)
1 pinch garam masala
1/2 tsp dry mango pwd (amchoor)
Water, enough to make firm dough. 
Roll the dough flat, slightly thicker than a paratha. Cut into desired shapes. Deep fry on low to medium heat. 
Do not fry on high heat, it wont cook inside, and wont become crisp. .
