Haven't had some nice japanese donburi bowls for a while. Luckily @tanukiraw now has vegetarian options- contains alliums! 
Had the impossible meat and tofu cheese baked rice- lightly crisp tofu tempura topped with impossible meat cooked in house doubanjiang sauce ( it is pretty spicy) over cheese baked  japanese steam rice. It cost about $17 (excluding delivery) but definitely a filling and satisfying portion!

There are also other impossible options with alliums too!
