I did not start making fabric masks early in this Covid19 pandemic, mainly because there has been controversy over the efficacy of fabric mask in preventing transmission of the virus. As more studies have proven the effectiveness of reusable fabric mask, and the implementation of mandatory mask wearing rule by the local government, I thought it is time to make some. I started with the pleated and 3D versions, but have been hearing many recommending the boat shape mask as it offers most comfort and breathability. I recalled that I have an expired N95 mask which was bought for the bad haze days few years back. Dug it out, and decided to make a boat shape mask with reference to it just to satisfy the crafter's desire to design and create in me ðŸ˜„. After a few rounds of adjustment, I finally came down to this final version. Indeed, the boat shape mask is my best vote among the various mask type I have made so far. Stay safe everyone!
