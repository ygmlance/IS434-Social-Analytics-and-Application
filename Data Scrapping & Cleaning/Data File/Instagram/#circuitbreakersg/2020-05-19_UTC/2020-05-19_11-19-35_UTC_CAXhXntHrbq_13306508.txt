This is the final reminder to self not to order delivery from restaurants that incorporate dine-in experience into their prices.. You will bound to be disappointed... paying similar price but getting food that doesnâ€™t justify at all... both Hubz and I LOVE La Strada! Thatâ€™s what prompted us to order this when their delivery menu is up.... from the looks of it, itâ€™s not difficult to tell we were disappointed, especially when we paid $28 for each of these main dish ðŸ˜£
