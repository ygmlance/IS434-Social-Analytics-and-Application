It’s not the news we wanted and means it will be even longer before we are able to hug and spend quality time with the people we care about but I’m choosing to see the silver lining and the blue sky beyond the clouds, that it’s a blessing to have people to miss, a privilege to feel safe and a responsibility to think about the more vulnerable within our community. This is going to continue to be a difficult time for many mentally, emotionally and financially and while I may not be able to help that much on the financial front, if you need someone to listen and maybe share a brighter perspective, am certainly willing to try, just dm me. Virtual hugs for now xxx
