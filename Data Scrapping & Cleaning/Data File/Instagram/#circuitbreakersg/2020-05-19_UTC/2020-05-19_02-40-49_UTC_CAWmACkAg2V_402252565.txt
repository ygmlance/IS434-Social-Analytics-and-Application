Let’s have a Alice In Wonderland kinda tea party 🍵🍰💐😍
.
The pink Minnie cake by @cakedwithlovesg is omg so sweet looking! Thank you so much for sending it over and bringing so much joy to our day 😘 When the cake came, just nice the bouquet gifted from @mmlittlee & @jiangmeiru created by @apfloral is still looking so pretty, a fabulous chance to make them into a small garden tea party at home ❤️
.
Circuit breaker is reaching the end (🤞🏻the date remains), let’s all hang in there and continue to do our part to #stayhome till it’s really over 👌🏻 for the time being, you can still enjoy some cafe styled high tea or brunch right at the comfort of your home with beautiful tablewares, cakes, flowers around 😉
