This Friday 22 May (USA) / Saturday 23 May (Asia), we get to unpack what it means to lead with purpose - through crisis, through a pandemic, through it all. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Whether you’re a leader of your community or a business.  Whether you’re someone who wants to discover what your values are and lean into them.  Whether you’re looking for hope or a safe space to be seen, valued and heard...this time is for you 💛⁣⁣
⁣⁣
During this time, you’ll be able to pause and participate in self reflection and connect with others during virtual breakouts to share about your experiences and thought bubbles. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I believe in the power of collective wisdom - which means that everyone has something to contribute and share to support one another in building up positivity, hope and resilience during these uncertain times.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
There are still a few spaces available as I try to keep the group cosy and I hope you’ll join me 💛⁣⁣
⁣⁣
P.S. There are two ways to participate:⁣
⁣⁣
1️⃣ Complimentary Community Pass - this means that you sign up for it through my mailing list (name + email is all you’ll need)! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
2️⃣ Pay what you want - this means you’ll decide an amount you wish to contribute with 100% of proceeds going to support @blessingsinabagasia and their community during this time. ⁣
⁣
Both these links can be found on @emilywjteng’s bio or visiting our Facebook Page.  If you can’t make it this time, would you pass this message on to a friend who would appreciate this? 🤗
