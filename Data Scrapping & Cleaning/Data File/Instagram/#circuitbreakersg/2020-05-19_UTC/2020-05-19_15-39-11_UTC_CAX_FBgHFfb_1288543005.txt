Finally I get to lay my hand on @upcakes.sg MSW durian chocolate cake. The combi matched perfectly well and it's not too sweet. Most important is the generous serving of the durian. ðŸ˜‹

My kid said this taste better than #awefullychocolate cake. ðŸ˜„

PS: Recently, I read an article on how #upcakes was started. A touching story behind.
