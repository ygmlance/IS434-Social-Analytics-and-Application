Sugar, spice, and everything nice.

Using their ultra-superpowers, Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup have dedicated their lives to making yummilicious TGB Goodies for all our Good Folks❤️💙💚 Here’s introducing TGB’s very own Powerpuff girls — the ones behind your yummy TGB treats. It’s not an easy time for F&B businesses, especially a small, local cafe like us. But, they’ve been working hard, day in and out, to make sure you get the best superbowls, hearty salads, and more💗.

Let’s show our hardworking TGB Powerpuff Girls some love — thank you @ikejan, @1_yun_janella and @mickywong0329 ❤️💙💚.
