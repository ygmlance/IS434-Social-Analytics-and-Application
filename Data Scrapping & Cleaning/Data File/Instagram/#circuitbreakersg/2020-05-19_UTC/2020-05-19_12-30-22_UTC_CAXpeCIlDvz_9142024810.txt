I've always regarded sandwiches as uninteresting, but now that I'm baking all the time and have a constant supply of loaves, I've been trying to challenge that - primarily by layering on familiar Asian flavours and by strictly using warm toasty bread.

For brunch today I took this buttery toasty slice, smeared with a thin layer of kewpie mayo and dijon mustard, then topped it with bacon, cherry tomatoes, and jammy, jammy eggs. Drizzled it with homemade chilli oil and a mandatory sprinkle of scallions. Paired it with cucumber salad tossed in a yuzu sesame dressing and devoured it with an ice-cold coffee.⁣ Was as happy as the two little jammy eggos :)
