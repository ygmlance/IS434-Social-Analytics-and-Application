I have been asked, “ for which age group are these suitable for?” .
Well, we don’t really peg an age as everybody’s level of learning is different. 3years old onwards is a guide. You may view that at 3, some of the activities may be difficult for them, but bonding and exposure is key. And with guidance, they can do it! The activities will ignite their love for the language.

You’d be surprised that even the older kids enjoy our kits. In fact, they milk more benefits as they have more dexterity with their fingers and they are at a stage of word recognition. Learn through play will certainly keep their interest up! .
Featured here is one of the activities in our latest COVID19 kit where a 9yo and 6yo are hard at work, sewing their virus bags! How cute is that?

There was even once where a 13yo was trying out some of the sensory flashcards we had in previous boxes. Just because his mum felt his Chinese was poor and he had no interest in the language. So really, it isn’t about the age. You know your child best 😁
