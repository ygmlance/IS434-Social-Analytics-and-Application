Another takeaway food haul from the CBD area.
Kicking it off with Newbie LA MENSA Italian Pasta Restaurant. The opening was a quiet affair in the midst of a semi-lockdown.
FRUTTI DI MARE $16.50:
The take out portion was astoundingly hugh, with 4 succulent mussels & 5 relatively meaty, sizable prawns & a few Squid rings. Not forgetting the thick Fettuccine that lines the bowl with all that delectable sauce that i would gladly lick it off. It has that slightly rich tomato taste that wasn't overwhelming. A pretty good & well executed pasta dish. By the way, the Seafood was very Fresh too. Only Cash payment(accepted) was what's written at the cashier. 6 Pasta & 3 Sides available at the moment.

Next is INDOCHILI, the name kinda give away what's it all about - Indonesian style comfort food. 20% off Food with a Free Drink(w/purchase of mains) thrown in as well. We had the Soy Chicken Bento($8 before discount) set. The sweet sauce kinda reminds me of the kecap manis. The Archar Archar & Tempeh definitely tasted different from our local version. It's relatively a good deal with the discount & freebies.

Last but not least, a taste of asia with YA LOR. Braised Duck Rice set $6.90 + $0.20  takeout box. From the rice to the duck to the tofu & bean sprouts, was delicious. The chili has a hint of sweetness & tanginess but could do with a bit more "heat" though. The thinly sliced duck meat makes it more managable to chew. 
Overall quite good.

Couldn't go overseas to eat? I just had a taste of Italy, Indonesia & Asia all at 1 location. ðŸ˜„
