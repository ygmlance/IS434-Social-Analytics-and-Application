Being at home more, I thought I’ll be able to catch up on sleep. However, the unknown future and changes we will face are keeping me up at night a bit more. With clients and friends asking for my thoughts and advice to their problems, it’s extra worrying, I’ve to admit. The circuit-breaker period has been taxing for all of us. While sleep and rest is important, let’s make full use of our time productively in the day instead of waiting for things to happen. I personally sleep a little better when I know I’ve spent my day well. I know I’ve done my best today. Till another day dawns, stay safe everyone.
