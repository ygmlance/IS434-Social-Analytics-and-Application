The word is on the streets folks.  The Govt has just announced the phased approach to resume activities after #circuitbreakersg 2 June 20.  We are NOT yet allowed to resume operations in Phase 1.  Looks like we're gonna be seeing each other online for a little longer.

Don't be sad! We'll keep the good times rolling with a healthy online class schedule in the weeks to come - THANK YOU as always for being such an awesome community and continuing to dance with us.

We will open public booking for Term 3 early in Phase 1 of CB easing.  If youâ€™ve already booked, your courses are locked in unless we contacted you to arrange otherwise.

We're looking forward to safely resuming dance life in the studio eventually, and hope you'll be there with us when the day comes. Stay posted here for updates.

In the meantime #justkeepzooming and WE LOVE YOU ALL ðŸ’“
