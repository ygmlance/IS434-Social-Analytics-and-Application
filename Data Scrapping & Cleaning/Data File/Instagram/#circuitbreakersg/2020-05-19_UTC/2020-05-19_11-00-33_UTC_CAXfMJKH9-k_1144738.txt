So I laboured all day and made chicken rice hahaha! Looks legit right? Smells it too. Can you imagine it’s all like pre packaged?
I used the New Moon Chicken Rice paste for the rice (thanks New Moon for sending it down!) - v easy, just mix it in, add pandan leaf, cook as usual, and it’s done.
The chicken from CS Tay I bought from Fairprice Finest. It’s also available on Shopee, which works for me because there’s delivery. This one is even easier - 4 mins in the microwave, sauce over it, quite good chilli sauce on the side. Maybe needs a touch more ginger and garlic but still ok. 
And I have my diet-busting CB treat!
