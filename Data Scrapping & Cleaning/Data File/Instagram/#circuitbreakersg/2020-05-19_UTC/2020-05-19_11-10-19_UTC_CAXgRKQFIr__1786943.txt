Since I have both the thai milk tea and thai green milk tea powder from @chatramue so why not? Bought it when I was in BKK end of last year. Had to clear away some boba as well so... tadah!‚Å£
‚Å£
Usually I would add condensed milk for the drink but since the boba pearls are sweetened with brown sugar, I decided not to add condensed milk. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Add Boba > Ice Cubes > Milk > Steeped Tea‚Å£

Perfect for the recent hot weather!
