CCB day 43
ðŸ¦ 
Today is the FIRST day I wear shoes after 43 days. Iâ€™m dead serious.
ðŸ¦ 
First day of returning to work after many days of Netflix-ing. And we are suppose to wear this face shield THING in class.
ðŸ¦ 
Before you laugh at my plight, let me walk you through how it feels like after 2.5 hours of talking non-stop.
ðŸ¦ 
Our classrooms are non-air-conditioned. Our academic blocks are extremely stuffy and warm, unlike many other schools. When I tried to wear the face shield on its own (looking like some stupid miner), it was okay at first, with this thick sponge across my forehead. Gradually it fogs up as you speak more due to the heat build-up. The plastic sheet starts to have saliva stains in front, itâ€™s just freaking gross. Your own voice echos within the plastic shield and it hurts your ears. Then you start to have a pool of perspiration across your entire forehead. With the sweat and saliva and smell, itâ€™s... disturbing.
ðŸ¦ 
Then I removed it because I no longer could take the soaking shield on my forehead and wore the 3-ply mask instead. Lo and behold, all the saliva started to build up inside the mask. It gets wetter and warmer and the mask starts slipping off the proper places. And you can hardly breathe because thereâ€™s limited oxygen flow. The worst thing is the stench. Youâ€™ll never know how bad saliva smells until now. By the end of 2.5 hours, it smells as if Iâ€™m wearing a portable public toilet in my nose. Itâ€™s so insanely disgusting, wet and smelly, I want to die.
ðŸ¦ 
Hello? 3-ply masks donâ€™t come cheap ok? I canâ€™t be changing a mask every other hour, like babies changing their diapers. And I donâ€™t exactly like the panty-like reusable mask we are given.
ðŸ¦ 
Oh my lord, I look stupid here. On a scale of 0 to 10, itâ€™s a 200. Help la.
ðŸ¦ 
ðŸ“·: Taken before lesson, when I still found it amusing. It definitely wasnâ€™t fun after that. I still cannot get over that sick stench.
