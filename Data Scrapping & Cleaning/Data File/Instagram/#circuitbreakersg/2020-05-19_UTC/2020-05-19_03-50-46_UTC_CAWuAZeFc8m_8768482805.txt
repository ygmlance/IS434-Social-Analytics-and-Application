Have you ever felt guilty eating ice cream? Why not make your own guilt free fruit popsicle (free of refined sugar) with grapefruit essential oil to help curb sugar cravings and boost your weight management!! Grapefruit essential is cold pressed from the rind. It is also full of antioxidants, aids digestion, relieves stress, ease hangover, boost circulation, and of course reduce sugar cravings!! Recipe:

Freeze 3 large bananas ( peel bananas before freezing as itâ€™s difficult to peel once frozen) 
Blend frozen bananas with 1/2 cup of any frozen fruits (raspberries, mango, strawberries or blueberries) and 3 drops of doTERRA grapefruit essential oil (Optional: add 2 tablespoon peanut butter)

Pour blended mixture into popsicle holders and freeze. 
You can replace Grapefruit essential oil with Wild Orange, Lime or Lemon essential oils. * Use only essential oils that are approved to be taken internally. *
