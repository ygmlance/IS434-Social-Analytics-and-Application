People think hougang is like an old dead town with nothing to do. I stay opposite a primary school and it gets pretty energetic during the weekdays. That is the thing i miss most being in the circuit breaker period. The hustle and bustle of my neighbours, the kids around my neighbourhood, the people walking across my carpark to get to the main bus stop. 
But nature doesnt stop being beautiful even in this period of measures, i have opportunities again to appreciate small moments like this and enjoy a beautiful sunset every single day
