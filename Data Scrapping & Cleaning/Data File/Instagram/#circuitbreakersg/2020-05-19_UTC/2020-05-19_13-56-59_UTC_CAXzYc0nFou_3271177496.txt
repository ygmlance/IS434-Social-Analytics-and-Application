Home made claypot rice to rival New Lucky Claypot Rice at Holland Drive and Lian He Ben Ji  in Chinatown. Ok I jest, I don't actually have a claypot or a charcoal stove at home, but packed with chicken, Chinese sausages and mushrooms, this is pretty legit. Can't wait for 2nd June for partial easing of the Circuit Breaker!
