Throw back to two weeks ago when we took away brunch from Craftsmen. Before covid-19, we've already been there a handful of times as we love their food. Now, I think I love them even more. Check out this box of halloumi and avocado! I don't know what magic they did with the halloumi, but they were crispy like nuggets, and so so good. Also, look at the sweet handwritten messages (next pic). Really brightened up our day.
