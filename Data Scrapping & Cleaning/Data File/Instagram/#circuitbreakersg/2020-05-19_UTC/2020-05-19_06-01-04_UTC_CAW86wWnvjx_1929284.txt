CB Day 43 of 56.  When you have to “ get rid” of remaining the Hollandaise Sauce which you had used for your Eggs Benedict  the day before , another good pairing with the sauce will be Salmon.  Cooked another fuss-free meal while working from home. Simply just marinate the salmon pieces , throw them in the oven. Then while waiting, just heat up the sauce and prepare the salad ( I still rinsed them ). All done in 20 mins.
