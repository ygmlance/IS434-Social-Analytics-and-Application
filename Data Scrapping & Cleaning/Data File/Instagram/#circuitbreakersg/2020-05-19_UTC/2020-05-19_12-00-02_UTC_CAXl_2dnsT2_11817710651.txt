#flutterworkoutchallenge WEEK ONE / FOUR completed ‼️🙌🏻 #cbday43 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Decided to make Tues as the NEW week instead of Sun. While Monday is a heavy chores day and Sunday marked as “happy food day” 🤣😋 not ideal for 🏋️‍♀️ rest . ▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️
The updated HPB app allows tracking of weekly MPVA 👍 (swipe to see) which is easy for performance record keeping. Hit 144mins for week 1 and is a wake up call to work towards my target of 300mins 🎯 . 3 more weeks to go 🙌🏻 2kg of fats to kill. ▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️▫️
