.
Part 2 (3-5sets) I did 4!
- 10x Sprinter lunges
- 10x Sit up and reach
- 10x Burpees to lunges

Today's message was SLOW & CONTROLLED, with the usual emphasis on form.

It's been more than a month since CB started, which was also when I decided to ramp up my workout routines and do it at least 5 times a week. Today, I felt the impact and tasted some results. I've definitely grown stronger and there's significant difference with my endurance and stamina too. To be honest, I've been feeling down and unmotivated as this CB dragged on.. but, witnessing this change today somehow made me feel better about myself and there's certain lightness. I can't put words to it, but there's more motivation and drive. I'll continue moving forward.
