Day 43 of #circuitbreakersg! These money envelopes in our Bold Flourishes design have added some punch into a super sluggish day. Just a note that we are still accepting all your orders now, but do take note that they will not arrive in time for Eid this Sunday. But I guess thatâ€™s fine too because weâ€™ll all be having a quiet Eid at home this year, and the earliest possibility of anything happening would be after 1 June right? So letâ€™s all hope that things will start easing up after that, slowly but surely ðŸ¥° hang in there friends! #rayatetapraya #eid2020
