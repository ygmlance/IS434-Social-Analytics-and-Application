Steamed buns from @justdoughsg, after so long! Cos @fatpigdiary reignited my cravings for orh nee! 🍠
✨
Featuring the purple sweet potato and yam, which’s my top 2 favourite flavours. After my not so pleasant experience of stale purple sweet potato filling previously, I’m so glad it’s back to normal. Love the lightly sweetened fillings which are very minimally greasy, so you can really taste the authentic flavours of the purple sweet potato and yam. Always prefer the yam as it’s chunky at some parts. It’s literally like eating orh nee! I think their fillings are probably the healthiest ones around. Plus, they are generous with the fillings too. Great to see they’re opening more outlets now! 🍞
