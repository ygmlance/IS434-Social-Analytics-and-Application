If you truly love nature, you will find beauty everywhere - Laura Ingalls Wilder
.
This lovely butterfly, still on a flower, caught my eye on my walk today. Decided to stop and capture this beautiful sight on my phone
.
We've read how the upside to everyone staying in globally, is that nature now has the chance to flourish
.
Animals can return to locations originally their's but were encroached upon by humans. The hole in ozone layer has closed. The air is fresher. Trees are standing tall and flowers are blooming. Mother nature is healing
.
Every dark cloud comes with a silver lining, so try to see the good in every bad situtation. Have you found your silver lining(s) in this Covid-19 situation? .
