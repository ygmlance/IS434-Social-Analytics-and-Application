Cakes from @luna.singapore 
Orh Nee cake - This is their signature cake. I really like Angie’s the choice yam cake but sadly the shop has closed down. Tried several others and this version from Luna’s is so good. It tastes more premium as compared to Angie’s actually 🤣The cake is made of pumpkin and layered with yam and gingko paste with chunks of yam cubes. The cake is so fragrant and doesn’t have perfume/artificial flavour. Appreciate that the cream was thinly layered. $8 a slice i would say is worth it. I have seen a slice of cake that cost $13+ gst. 👍🏻👍🏻 do try! 
Yuzu Cheesecake - If you like citrusy sour flavour, go for it. Can’t really taste the Yuzu, cheesecake is more distinct here.

Dark chocolate speculous - I like this besides the Orh Nee cake as well. The dark chocolate is so rich. This is one good chocolate cake and the cake taste abit salty? Reminds me of peanut butter (can someone tell me if peanut butter is salty LOL) The chocolate pops is a plus point.

Mango passionfruit - The cream is also thinly layered. Refreshing, suitable for light palate. 
All cakes are $8/slice, $80/whole cake. Delivery available, check out @luna.singapore
