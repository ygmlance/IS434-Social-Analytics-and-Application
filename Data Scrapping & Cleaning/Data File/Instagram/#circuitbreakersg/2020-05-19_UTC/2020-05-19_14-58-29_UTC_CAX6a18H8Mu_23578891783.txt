Are you worried that lifting weights will make you bulky?🏋️‍♀️🤷‍♀️

I can tell you now that it definitely WILL NOT! What it will do is:
.
✅Help you rebuild lost muscle mass (women lose a pound of muscle a year after 30 unless we work to maintain it)
.
✅Increase your metabolism
.
✅Get you looking lean and toned
.
✅Increase your energy
.
✅Increase your bone density(a Super important health factor for women as we age)
.
✅Improve your posture

I could go on-but you get the idea! 🌟 To build muscle, you ideally should be working each muscle group two days per week. Lift a weight that starts to feel quite heavy after 8-12 reps at set one, and then left it for another 2 sets, for at least 8 reps again if possible. If it feels like you could do more-lift a heavier weight.
.
It really is as simple as that-💁‍♀️the same goes for body weight exercises-if it feels too easy, try to modify it to increase the intensity. Doing more reps does not mean you are necessarily growing your muscle mass-you may only be increasing your muscle endurance. This is why a lot of aerobics type classes can feel very difficult, as they require stamina, but they don’t cause many noticeable changes in our physiques.
