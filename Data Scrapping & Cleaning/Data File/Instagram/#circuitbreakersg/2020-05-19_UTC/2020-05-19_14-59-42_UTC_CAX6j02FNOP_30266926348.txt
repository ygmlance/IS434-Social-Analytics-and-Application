CB DAY 44 -

No HBL with school today because the teachers all went for swabbing. So we went out for a spin and played bricks after nap. It was all good fun. Tried to get him to do some number activity with me but he was more interested in reading on his own. Of course I didn't force my way! If not he is gonna resent me. ðŸ˜Œ Love it that he can read on his own. Meimei was quite a handful these few days. Most probably dropping nap!
