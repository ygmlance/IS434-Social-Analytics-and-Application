had some leftover cheese in the fridge so i made some breakie mac&cheese
-
for the mac&cheese, this is roughly 1.5cups worth of mini macaroni, cooked with milk and water in a rough ratio of 3:1 (didn’t measure bc this is something you can eyeball). add in 1tbs of butter once the macaroni is fully cooked and the milk is slightly thickened. then, add in roughly 30g of cheddar, 30g of brie and 15g of parmesan (roughly) and stir till it’s creamy 🧀 -
i added around 2 tbs worth if fried bread crumbs made with stale bread and a knob of butter for extra texture and topped the entire dish with a sunny side up ☀️
