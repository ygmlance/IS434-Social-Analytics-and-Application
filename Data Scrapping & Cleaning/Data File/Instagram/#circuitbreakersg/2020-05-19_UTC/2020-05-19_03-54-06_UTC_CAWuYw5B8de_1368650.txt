🌟Counting my blessings and found this #throwback picture of exploring Japan 🌟 2 More weeks till end of #circuitbreaker I hope everyone has been alright ❤️ In case you didn’t know, it is okay to feel sluggish, anxious or unproductive because this is not the normal that we know ❤️ Staying cooped up at home is suffocating enough, but sometimes facing our family members require us to self-regulate our emotions, or working from home might be stressful and tough due to feeling handicapped ❤️ Breathe, remember you are doing your best and you can get through this. Sending you good vibes till our feet can hit the soil quick and when the wind would ferry the reverberations of our abundant laughters again ❤️
