When you get that news alert that life right now is pretty much the new normal till further notice, what happens next? Go to the supermarket again? ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
It’s been a long and arduous road with no end in sight for a couple of months now, and it sucks. The mental warfare continues. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Being adaptable is a fundamental life lesson that 5 years of dental school in a foreign land taught me and dentistry continues to teach me. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
At 19, I started life afresh in this foreign place called Cork, Ireland (can’t wait to visit again!) I learned to stop being a quitter when things got hard. I evolved into being that dedicated Asian #nerd who wakes up to walk in the rain and chope/save a seat in the study room at 6am. Juggling lectures, seeing patients and still cooking so that I could save money and have a taste of home was pretty much everyday. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
What did that result in? ⁣⁣
Independence and empowerment. ⁣⁣
Graduating with 2 awards for being top student in endodontics and winning 1st place for an aesthetic rehabilitation case. ⁣⁣
This is the same girl who was always in the last class in school and told she was not suited to be a dentist. ⁣
⁣
Being able to cook freestyle or anything I feel like as long as I follow the recipe. This is the same girl who microwaved a chicken in aluminium foil at 19. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Trivial, some may say. But to me this is a gentle reminder to myself mostly, that when we wait, struggle through the walk and look back at the journey, being adaptable leads to no regrets. ⁣We evolve to be better tomorrow than we are today. ⁣
⁣⁣
Keep walking with faith. ⁣⁣
Things are getting better and we are getting through this together. ❣️⁣
