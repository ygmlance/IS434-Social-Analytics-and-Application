So if you noticed the general pattern, tonight is #angmoh night. The Hubs requested #sliders🍔🍔🍔, though he had a burger just 2 nights ago 😆. We were looking specifically for simple, diner-style sliders, without too many flavors/condiments. In the end we ordered cheeseburger (not shown) and chicken burger sliders from @pscafe (Martin Rd), as well as a bolognese pizza 🍕 to supplement. There was sufficient meat to balance out the carbs, and cravings were indeed satisfied! 
However, we are still on the lookout for classic American-style burgers and sliders. If anyone has recommendations, do let us know!
