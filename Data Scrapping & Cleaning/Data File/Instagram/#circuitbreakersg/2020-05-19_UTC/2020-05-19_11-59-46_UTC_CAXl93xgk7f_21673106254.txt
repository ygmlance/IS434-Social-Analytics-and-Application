Sambal Udang Nanas. Or Prawns and Pineapple cooked in a chilli-onions gravy. My mum hasn’t cooked this in a long while. I’m not sure if other #Peranakan families cook this too but this recipe has been in my family from my grandfather’s time. This dish has a strong spicy, sour-sweet, and umami taste. Spicy thanks to the chilli paste of minced onions, fresh chilli or chilli paste, candlenuts, belacan (hard prawn paste) and a tablespoon or less of turmeric powder. Sour-sweet due to the fresh sliced pineapples and assam (tamarind water). Tomatoes are optional. And Umami due to the fresh prawns. It seems complicated but once you get the sambal (chilli-onion paste) done, and the frying of it, the rest is easy enough. I haven’t searched for this recipe online yet so I’m not sure if the Malay community have this dish. Bon appetit! #dinner #peranakanfood #peranakanchinese #myheritage #stayhome #stayhomeandcook #circuitbreakersg #singapore #singaporefood
