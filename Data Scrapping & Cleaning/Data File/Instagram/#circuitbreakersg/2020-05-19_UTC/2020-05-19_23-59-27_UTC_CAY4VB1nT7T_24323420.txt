Yaa RABB🤲🏻
Guide me all the way 
to your Jannah
Don’t let me go astray ‘cause I need you.
By my side, I wish to be close
Close to You throughout 
my life.
Be with me all the way❤️ .
.
.
Yaa RABB🤲🏻
I know that sometime I do
I do forget that my last 
breath could be the last.
Forgive me ’cause I can't 
thank you enough
Forgive me when I doubt 
your love❤️ .
.
.
Yaa RABB🤲🏻
I know that You could easily
Take away everything 
You’ve given me
And I try to remember
Not to take anything for granted
‘Cause I know that one day
Suddenly this will all 
come to an end
So my last wish is for You 
to be pleased with me❤️
