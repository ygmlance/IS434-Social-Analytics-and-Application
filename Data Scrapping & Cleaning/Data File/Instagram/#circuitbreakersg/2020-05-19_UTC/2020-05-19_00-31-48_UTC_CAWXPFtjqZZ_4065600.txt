Not sure what’s up with all her expressions though she certainly has every right to be wary of new creams and lotions because a baby’s skin is super sensitive. Always test new products on a small surface area of baby’s skin (eg. heel, back of hands) to ensure that there’s no reaction / rash. Glad to be supporting this homegrown brand of sunscreens! Both types were easy to apply and quickly absorbed, without leaving bb Gen feeling sticky afterwards. 👍🏼 We can safely head out without worrying about the sun after this #CircuitBreakerSG period. Can’t wait for her to start learning swimming too, an activity I loved when I was a kid. Pop over to @thelilgiants and @aquaducks_sg to find out and participate in their giveaway! Results will be out 25th May.
