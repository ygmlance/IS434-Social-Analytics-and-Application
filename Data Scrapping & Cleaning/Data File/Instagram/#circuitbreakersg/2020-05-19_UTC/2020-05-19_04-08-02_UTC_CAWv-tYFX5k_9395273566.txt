"My kids absolutely love the math assignments on this platform because they think it's "a job" and they earn KooBit coins for each completed chapter. These coins can be used to redeem game plays on the platform! The games are fun, interactive and promotes bonding between C and M. Yes, i told C to teach M and he loves being the teacher.⠀

This is, by far, the only math assignments both my kids ask to do everyday. Keeps them occupied and gives me some me time." - @mummyslittlebb⠀
