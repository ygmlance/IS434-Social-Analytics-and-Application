🦞And tonight’s Lobster Night!!🦞We finally got down to buying some live lobsters from Evergreen Seafood and making something outta them🥰⁣
⁣
Did our lobsters 2 ways- First one was boiled for 5 mins and finished off in the oven with cheese and Mentaiko💗💗This was so damn good! The second was boiled and served with a Garlic Butter lemon and white wine sauce ( if you swipe left to our video, you will see us drenching the juicy lobster flesh in all that sauce 🤤🤤)⁣

If you wanna buy some quality live or frozen seafood such as crabs, salmon, squid, oysters, fish, prawns, mussels, clams etc, you can check out Evergreen Seafood! You will be Spoilt for choice 😍⁣
