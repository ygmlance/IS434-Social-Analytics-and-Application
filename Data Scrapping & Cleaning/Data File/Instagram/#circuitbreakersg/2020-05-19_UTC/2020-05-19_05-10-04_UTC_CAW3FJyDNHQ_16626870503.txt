Adding a little colour with butterfly blue pea flower to the otherwise plain pancakes just for the fun of it. ⁣
⁣
This is gluten free pancakes using buckwheat and rice flour. ⁣

⁣
I use milk as I don’t have almond milk on hand today. ⁣
⁣
As I only have some dried butterfly blue pea flower but it’s very light, compared to powder form.  So, I added a little charcoal powder for a little darker tone. ⁣
⁣
I don’t usually buy buckwheat flour, so I mill it using Thermomix for 1.5 mins to get freshly milled flour.  I store the extra in fridge. ⁣
