Having the 2nd creme brulee! Made with @sallysbakeblog 's recipe. It is a soft, melt in your mouth texture yet still firm looking.

I might adapt the recipe to have some milk to replace the heavy cream and see if it would make the custard lighter. Cus I can't take too much milk/cream and 2 spoons of this was enough for me. But I wanna eat it all. Lol. 
Thinking if I should give earl grey creme brulee a try. Since I have the tea leaves. Or maybe coffee? ü§î the possibilities are never ending! .
