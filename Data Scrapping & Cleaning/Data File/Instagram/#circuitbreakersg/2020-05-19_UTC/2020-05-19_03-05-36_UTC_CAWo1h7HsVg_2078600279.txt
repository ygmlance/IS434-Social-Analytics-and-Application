At our recent fireside chat, @thecrystalstream and @krys_say discussed the immense health benefits of Shaking: a non-linear movement effective in resolving mental paralysis and inertia through physiological pattern disruption.

Come and experience the invigorating power of this technique at the Shake and Flow Meditation live on Zoom this Wednesday, 6.30pm SGT, hosted by Stephanie Bovis – a leading fitness and wellness expert in Singapore. Sign up via the link in our bio.

Learn how to harness the powerful techniques of breathing, active meditation and movement to dissolve the tensions of the day and activate the restorative potential of the body’s lymphatic system. We'll start off with an energetic shaking of the body, before transitioning to gentler, freer movement. All of this directs the body and mind towards one final destination: pure stillness and observation.

Come prepared for the session wearing loose clothing, and in a space that allows for whole body movement.
