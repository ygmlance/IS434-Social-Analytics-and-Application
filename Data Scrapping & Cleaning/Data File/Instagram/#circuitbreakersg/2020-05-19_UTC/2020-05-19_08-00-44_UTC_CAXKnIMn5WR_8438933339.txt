Who is calling for HELP??? Especially during this #COVID19, I'm sure a lot of parents are screaming for help, one moment or another. Even as this #CircuitBreakerSG looks to be ending, hey life as a parent doesn't stop here, you know 🤪

This book is my saviour! I got introduced to this by my investment specialist 🤭 This book is so easy to read. Seriously an important point cos parents simply got no time at all, (dont tell me to finish a book! Ha!) You can complete this!🤩 Very simple logic and concepts, breaking down parenting much needed life skills. Please do not let this book get into the hands of your children or all magic will be gone... 🤯

Gonna read this again and again! Afterall, practice makes perfect. ❤✅ #stayathome #stayhomeforSG #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakerSG
