Day 43 of #stayhomesg #circuitbreakersg *
I want to climb the highest mountain (if only I didn’t have height phobia)...
I want to dive into the deepest ocean ( if only I didn’t have fear of deep water)...
I want to trek into the deepest jungle (if only I weren’t scared of insects and wild animals)...
... just so I can bury this doll.

The doll I’ve been struggling with is finished. As in I’m done with it. It is unfinished. Maybe it will be in this state forever. I don’t know. I don’t care. I can’t motivate myself to knit the remaining leg and shoe. So the doll will be one legged. I hope it’s not too cruel but I’m so done with the doll. It’s been exhausting dealing with the seams after seams. Knitting this doll has killed a bit of the joy I get from knitting. Maybe this pattern is too hard for me. *
Pattern from My Knitted Doll. (with apologies to the author)
