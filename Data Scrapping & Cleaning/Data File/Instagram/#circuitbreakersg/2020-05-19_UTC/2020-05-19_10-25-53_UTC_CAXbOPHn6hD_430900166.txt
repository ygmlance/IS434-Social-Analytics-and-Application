Thank you for being our friends! This CB period is tough on everyone - the virus is no respecter of persons. And yes it’s true, independent fashion retailers like us are hard hit as we’re not open for business. But during this season, sooooo many of you have purchased online with us through Instagram & FB, DM us, WhatsApp us ... we’ve received preorders for our Summer collection... ON OUR WEBSITE!!!! and I’m super grateful because I know our photos are not the sharpest in town! We are not the most organised folks when it comes to online business... in fact, we’ve just finished a short photography course during CB to brush up our ‘skills’! 📸📸What really touched us was when our customers buy our merchandise to gift to their friends! In one instance, the friend who received the ‘gift’ also knew us & called us immediately because she thought we sent it to her wrongly ... our delivery person said delivery was FREE, but she didn’t want us “lose money”, so she called to ask us how much it was, she was going to pay us back! ( for something she didn’t choose?!) Super sweet, super thankful. 🙏🏼💖 Just do you know, everything was cleared up eventually... we didn’t take her money of course! 😂🤣 But we got her feels... and it made our day! Here’s to friendship! Our journeys are only as wacky as the friends we keep! 😜🤪💞💞🥂
