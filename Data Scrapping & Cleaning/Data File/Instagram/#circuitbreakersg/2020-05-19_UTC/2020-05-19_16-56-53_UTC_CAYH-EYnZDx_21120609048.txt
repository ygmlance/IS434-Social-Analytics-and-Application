。2020年5月17日。have always used the acros simulation on my X100F and have always been curious how an image looks like on the neopan acros film。I think both digital and film are comparable so to the fujifilm engineers，programmers and designers，👍🏻 number 1。kudos to the fujifilm x series team🙏🏻。second image has streaks running vertically down，any idea what can cause this？。strange thing is that it only happen to this one frame and not the entire roll 🤷🏻‍♂️
