📍San Salvador // Rosario Church, designed by Ruben Martinez, one of El Salvador's most prominent sculptors and completed in 1971, is a fascinating place of art & architecture. There are no columns and pillars inside the church, so as not to obstruct any view of the simple altar, yet is built to withstand the earthquakes that occur from time to time. From the outside, the church looks like a concrete bunker or airplane hangar, but once you are inside, the stained glass arch simply awes and amazes 🌈
