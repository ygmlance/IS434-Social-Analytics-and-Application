Winding down with a short workout and long stretching after a productive day working at home today was pure rejuvenation for the body and mind. Watching Taiwanese travel shows over dinner made the evening even sweeter but it made me miss paintball even more. I can't wait for everything and paintball to be back in action so I can go everywhere to see my paintball friends and play paintball.
