Mrs Ghosh, one of our #HighSchool biology teachers, has found using #GoogleJamboard as a great way for students to work collaboratively and share their ideas on a common platform. "Itâ€™s very visual and engaging as students can scribble, post sticky notes, add images and also connect on #Meet to discuss and present their work. I have used it extensively this week for my Grade 11 & 12 students for lessons, quick review quizzes and also to collect feedback when required." How's #homelearning going for everyone today? ðŸ˜Š
