Day 41. Woke up early to get grocery for the next few days. Lunch is a dry noodle (回魂面) with braised pork and ramen egg. Tea - made a batch of Taro Mochi Dorayaki. Doraemon's fav snack with a tweak. Love how soft and chewy the mochi is. The fluffy evening clouds resemble the mochi that has been devoured. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #realfood #homecookedmeal #mochi #dorayaki #stayingathomeisfun #instafood #铜锣烧
