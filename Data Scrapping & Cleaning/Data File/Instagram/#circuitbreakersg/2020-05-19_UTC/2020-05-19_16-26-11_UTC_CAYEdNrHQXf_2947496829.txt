I usually travel during the holidays as a way to recharge and rest.

Looking at travel pictures and missing my past mid-year travels... |
1. Camel riding and desert camping in China, 2015
2. Teaching English in a local primary school in Thailand, 2016 
3. Road-tripping in New Zealand, 2017 
4. Hiking in Spain, 2018 
5. Stuffing my face with Ichiran in Japan, 2019

6. Staying home in Singapore, 2020 ðŸ™‚ 
Since I (we) canâ€™t travel this holiday, Iâ€™ve picked up a new hobby, buying beautiful plants and keeping them alive! Becoming a full-time #PlantCher during #CircuitBreakerSG

Nobody asked for it. HAHA! ðŸ¤­
But I will start sharing my collection of plants here tomorrow together with some interesting bite-sized info! ðŸ™ƒ
STAY TUNED! ðŸ¤“
