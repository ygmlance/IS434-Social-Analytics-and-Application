Since you loved our single-pot recipes, weâ€™ve another zhnged-up instant noodle recipe that can be made entirely in a single frying pan. The Ramelette is a literal combination of â€˜ramenâ€™ and an â€˜omeletteâ€™, topped with cheese and ham to make a quick supper snack.

Ingredients
1 packet instant noodles
1 tsp cooking oil
3 eggs
Cheese (optional)
Ham (optional)

Steps:
1. Cook the instant noodles in boiling water, without adding the seasoning. After itâ€™s cooked, drain the noodles and rinse with cold water.
2. Pat the noodles lightly with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.
3. Whisk the eggs with the instant noodles seasoning. If you prefer less salt, you can add less of the seasoning.
4. Lightly oil a heated non-stick pan. Add the noodles and use the back of a spatula to gently flatten the noodles into a circle.
5. Let the noodles cook until they turn crispy on the bottom, before flipping over to the other side.
6. Pour in the eggs and let them cook on one side, before flipping over again.
7. Put cheese and ham pieces on top of the omelette, fold it into half, and serve.
