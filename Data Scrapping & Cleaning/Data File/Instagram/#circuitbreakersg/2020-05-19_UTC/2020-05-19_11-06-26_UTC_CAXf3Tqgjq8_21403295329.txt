I've never tried patchwork, I've never made pants, I've never made pockets. I drafted the pants by myself without knowing if it will fit or not. Really risky business considering the time I took to cut, place, and sew the patches. I prayed really hard that it'll be okay; thank God it came out good enough. ðŸ¥³
