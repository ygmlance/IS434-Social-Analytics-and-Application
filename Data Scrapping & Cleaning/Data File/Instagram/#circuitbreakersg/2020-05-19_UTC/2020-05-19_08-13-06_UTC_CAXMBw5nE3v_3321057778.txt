Things to do with the kids #60

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Hey, Vanilla, I'm the #kingofthecastle get down you dirty rascal." "Titus, I am down, I'm on the ground below you, if you hadn't noticed" "So, you acknowledge my superiority?" "If you mean your superior annoyingness at 3am pretending to be Caruso, then yes." "Don't be facetious, Vanilla. Besides, Caruso's is an excellent little Italian bistro, known for its authentic pizzas." "Titus, you know what I meant, and you're talking about food again." "Honestly, Vanilla, you mentioned it first." "Do you actually like pizza, Titus?" #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
