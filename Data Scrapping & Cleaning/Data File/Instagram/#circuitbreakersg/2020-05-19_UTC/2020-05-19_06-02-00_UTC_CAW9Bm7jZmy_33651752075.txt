What’s the workout?
StretCHING Yoga with Ching

Yoga for all levels. (Hatha based). Focusing on simple yoga poses and alignment with a hint of core and balancing work to fire up the body for a challenge! Plenty of engagement of the muscles with deep stretches and holds. A well balanced class for stretching, releasing tension and some relaxation!

Have a wall, chair and towel for class this evening. If you don't have enough wall space, not to worry you can just have a chair and towel. 
Why not make the most of the things we see the most during circuit breaker and have fun in the comfort of our own home!
