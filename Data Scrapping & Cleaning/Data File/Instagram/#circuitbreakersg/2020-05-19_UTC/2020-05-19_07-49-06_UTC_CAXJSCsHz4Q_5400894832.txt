One of the things that I truly love about @nativebarsg is how when they serve a drink/cocktail it always comes with a story. Just goes to show how much thought is put into every cocktail. And while I got this bottle of Yuzu gin as a gift. It also came with some garnishes, (freshly sourced, as I was told by the person who delivered the gift), tonic water, plus an extra boost of a cocktail! They also sent a message on how to best enjoy the drink. These little things kind of make up for the fact that weâ€™re not able to visit Native bar during this time. They even offer a $5 off your next purchase if you return the bottle. ðŸ˜Š .

Congratulations again on placing 6th on this yearâ€™s Asiaâ€™s @50bestbars . 
Canâ€™t wait to have some drinks with you guys and hear the stories that come with it ðŸ¥‚ðŸ¥ƒðŸ¥‚ .
