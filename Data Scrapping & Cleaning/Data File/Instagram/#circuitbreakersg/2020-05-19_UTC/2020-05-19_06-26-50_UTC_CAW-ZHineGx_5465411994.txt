This may not be healthy but we canâ€™t deny the goodness when itâ€™s eaten together with tau suan or peanut soup ğŸ˜œ 
I love it served and fully dipped in a bowl of warm porridge ğŸ˜ŒğŸ˜‹ (actually I just had it for breakfast hahaha) 
Btw, does anyone know thereâ€™s a famous porridge place at Hougang? And... thereâ€™s a damn good you tiao at opposite Kopitiam? Best combo of porridge and you tiao ever! ğŸ˜‹
