Dinner this evening, was not the usual fare of local dishes, but a foray into the Thai realm, with the simple, yet popular Pad Kra Pao, or Stir-fried Minced Pork with Basil. My version has a lot less fire than traditional recipes, using regular chillies instead of the more fiery chilli padi, or birds eye chillies.  Minced garlic and sliced chillies were sweat until fragrant, minced pork, a few dashes of fish sauce, superior light and dark soya sauces were added, and these were fried together at high heat. When nearly cooked, chopped long beans were added, and the mixture cooked at high heat. Just before it was fully ready, the Thai Basil leaves were added, and stirred in at high heat. This was served hot, with steamed rice and a fried sunny-side up egg. Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #padkrapao #mincedporkbasil #thaifood #thaicuisine #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
