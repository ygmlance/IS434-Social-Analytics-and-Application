Brunch today, was Char Kway, or Black Fried Carrot Cake! Carrot cake base, bought from the market, was first cut into little cubes. I then heated up the wok, poured in some rendered lard, lard cubes, minced garlic and a mixture of sweet and salty preserved turnip and sweat them till fragrant. The carrot cake cubes were then added, along with a few dashes of fish sauce, and the mixture was stirred well. I diluted some dried shrimp chilli paste with a little bit of water to allow it to spread better and added that into the carrot cake and folded it in. Beaten eggs were then added, and i let it cook until it was about set, before mixing it well and adding the thick sweet dark soya sauce and continuing to mix well to incorporate the sauce into the carrot cake. Delicious, when served hot, with a generous sprinkling of chopped spring onions! ðŸ˜‹ #charkway #chyetowkway #teochewfood #teochewcuisine #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
