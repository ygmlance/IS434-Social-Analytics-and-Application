Let's talk about #zinc. ⁠
✅ Zinc is an immune booster and needed to regulate and maintain the well-being of our skin, muscles, bones, nails, teeth, hair as well as the brain.⁠
✅ Zinc serves as an antioxidant: It reduces oxidative stress thereby decreasing the quantity of some inflammatory proteins in the body. ⁠
✅ It reduces ageing: It maintains healthy ageing by repairing DNA and RNA together with preventing neoplastic cell growth.⁠
✅ It boosts the immune system: Zinc is necessary for the growth and development of the body and its deficiency affects many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. ⁠
