Cir Breaker Day 43 Lunch.

Spam and egg don 
A bowl of rice topped with pan seared spam cubes, fluffy scrambled eggs and sliced creamy avocado.

Sure get scolding from some friends when they see my post. Haha. But I was intrigued by this bowl of sinful goodness when I came across the hashtag #spamdonchallenge and the images 'tormented' me for a week until I decided to make my own today.

My favourite spam actually hails from the Land of Kimchi. It's still Spam, but somehow the taste is better and this mild version less salty. I used to cart some back when I travelled there cos they were not available here. However, we can now get them easily on Qoo10 and Shopee, so I stocked up more at the start of the #Circuitbreakersg.
Now, tell me you aren't tempted by it at allðŸ˜œ
