Hong Kong Yee Fu Noodles

If you have left over gravy from braised pork, will be a good idea to use it to cook Yee Fu Noodles

Ingredient: Hong Kong Yee Fu Noodles half packet, minced pork, vege (I use sweet potato leaf baby but you can use others e.g. Nai bai, spinach, cabbage etc.), any mushrooms (I use king oyster mushroom and shimeji here)

❶ Marinate minced pork with corn flour, pinch of salt, 1 tablespoon of soya sauce. Put a pot of water to boil Yee Fu Noodles
❷ Stir minced pork together with minced garlic until pork is 80% cooked
❸ Add mushrooms and braised pork gravy, bring it to boil
❹ Add boiled Yee Fu Noodles and vege. Stir to mix well and cook for another 10 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of dark soya sauce and 1 tablespoon of light soya sauce. Add salt to taste.
❺ Turn to the lowest fire and stew for 5 to 10 minutes. Then it is ready to serve.
