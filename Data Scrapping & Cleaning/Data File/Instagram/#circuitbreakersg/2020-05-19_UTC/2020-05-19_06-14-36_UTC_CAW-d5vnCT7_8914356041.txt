[brunch] | #sglocalfood
Bought black and white Fried Carrot Cake and Pontian Wanton Noodle for breakfast this morning. Do you know which is my share 😉
.
今天的早餐和下午茶：有黑白菜头粿，云吞面和提拉米苏当甜的

TEA-BREAK
🍰 Tiramisu from #oldsengchoong Facebook live sales. Gosh it’s really good and worth the price but just too bad I didn’t managed to get hold of their pandan chiffon due to technical error 😅
.
This round I still bought their mushroom soup and our favorite bread plus spaghetti sauce
