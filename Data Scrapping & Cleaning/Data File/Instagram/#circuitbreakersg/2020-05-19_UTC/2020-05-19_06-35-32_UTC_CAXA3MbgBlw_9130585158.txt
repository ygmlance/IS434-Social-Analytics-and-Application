Quarantine would not have been slightly fun, without the amazing East Coast Park.  Singapore 🇸🇬 has the most incredible parks , especially this gem.  I ran 6 miles in the heat, but the shade along the sea was perfect!  Not letting this Circuit Breaker (Singapore’s fancy name for Isolation) get me down or FAT!🏋️‍♀️🥊💃👟. I hope everyone puts this incredible island on their bucket list.  I’ve been blessed to call this place home for 4 years.  #circuitbreakersg #singapore2020 #expatlife #expatliving #lovethisplace #stayfitdontquit #healthiswealth🌳💰💯
