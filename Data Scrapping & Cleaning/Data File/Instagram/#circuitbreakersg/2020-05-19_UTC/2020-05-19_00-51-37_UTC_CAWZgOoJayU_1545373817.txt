Homemade McFlurry Mudpie 
McDonald’s has reopened for business but they are not selling their desserts for now.  We decided to try making it ourselves as my gal was craving it. 
Here’s how to do it: 
Ingredients:
1. Good Vanilla flavoured ice cream - means the more “atas” a.k.a premium ones. We have tried using a more affordable brand but it cannot replicate the exact taste. This is one ingredient that you will need to splurge on.
2. Milk
3. Oreo 
4. Chocolate Syrup
There you go. With just 4 simple ingredients you can replicate the exact taste of McFlurry Mudpie. It’s good in the sense that you can make it in smaller cups like what we did. It’s just to satisfy our cravings and not grow fat 😉😅
