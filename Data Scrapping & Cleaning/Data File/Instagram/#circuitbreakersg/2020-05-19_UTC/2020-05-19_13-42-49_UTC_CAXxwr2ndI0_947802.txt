Iftar Day 26
Fish and mashed potatoes with cherry tomatoes. Husbang said the highlight of the dinner was the Dory fish ðŸ¥° while that is true. I personally was impressed with how the mash somehow had a tinge of sweetness and tomatoes were very nicely done. Wouldâ€™ve love some salad but unfortunately we donâ€™t have any in our fridge. Nonetheless, alhamdulilah for the great meal. ðŸ¥° ðŸ¥° ðŸ¥°
