#circuitbreakersg day 43

Had some leftover dough from noodle-making the other day and decided to have mee hoon kueh (hand torn noodles) for dinner because it takes far less time to prepare than cutting the noodles by hand.😄✌🏼

This is the first time I have eaten noodles made of refrigerated dough and it actually tasted quite good still. 😀

Am happy today as I had a nice chat on the phone with a good friend that I have not seen in a long time. ☺️ #gratitudediary

Connecting with our loved ones really does make it easier to cope with the current situation. If you haven’t checked in on a close friend or family member in a while, it will be nice to text or call. 😉
