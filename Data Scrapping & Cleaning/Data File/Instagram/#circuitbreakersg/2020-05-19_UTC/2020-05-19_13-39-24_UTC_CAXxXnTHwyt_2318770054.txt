Lately, I've been dreaming about cafes, pastries, coffee and about gatherings before this whole stay home period 😌💭Really can't wait for this tough phase to pass especially with the news today that dining-in is still not allowed since 7 April 2020 😢

Here's something to cheer up with, 📸 featuring @tiongbahrubakery famous Kouign Amann ($4.50) — buttery and sugary crisp on the outside, crisp layers that I can't resist taking a bite!! Along with the Lemon Tart ($7.50), my pastries craving are satisfied just by admiring it 🤤☺️ Then, ending it off with a cup of latte — my favourite 💕
