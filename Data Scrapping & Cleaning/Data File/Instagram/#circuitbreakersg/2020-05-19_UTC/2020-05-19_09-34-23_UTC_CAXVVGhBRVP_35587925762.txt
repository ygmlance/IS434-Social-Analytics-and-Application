Absolutely love pairing these with our black Oreo Chocolate Cake for brunch! Do you know what these are?

Hint: We made these from scratch before the boba shops were shut temporarily! ðŸ¤”ðŸŒš Be it bubble tea (Singaporeans' all-time fav) or cakes and cookies, remember to treat yourself because you deserve it! 520 isn't just about your partner and we want you to send love to yourself too! ðŸ–¤

THAT IS WHY we're also working on some tasty treats in a box we're calling "black beauties in a box" so that all you beauties and beaus out there treat yourself right!! #tapiocaflour #boba #brownsugarmilktea #brownsugarfreshmilk #bubbletea #bubbletealover #blackcakes #oreochocolatecake #oreocravings #brunchsingapore #brunchinsg #dessertsg #cakesg  #bubbleteapearls #diybubbletea #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker  #bakebox #homebakes
