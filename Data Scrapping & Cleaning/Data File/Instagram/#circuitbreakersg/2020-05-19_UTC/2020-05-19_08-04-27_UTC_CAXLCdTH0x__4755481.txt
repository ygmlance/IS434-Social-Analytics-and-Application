Has anyone seen or used #purplerice ? I bought this from #shanghai last year. The salesgirl said it’s like regular rice but I cooked a small batch and found that it was #glutinousrice which I thought would be good for something like lor mai gai. I soaked it overnight and it absorbed all the water and had a porridge-like texture. I ended up using  it by rinsing once, and steaming it with no added fluids, and still it had a very mushy texture. Very curious. Appreciate any info anyone can give. Google wasn’t very helpful and my Chinese is not good enough to try Baidu.
