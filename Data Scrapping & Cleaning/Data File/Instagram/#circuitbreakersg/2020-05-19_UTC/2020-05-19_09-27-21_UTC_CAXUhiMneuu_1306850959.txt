☘️ Happiness is meant for everyone but is elusive as a butterfly. Happiness is beautiful, as a flower. It cannot be expressed in any rhyme. It may only last a fraction of a long hour. But it stays inside the heart beyond all time. ☘️ Happiness is also looking around you and your surroundings and realising how blessed we are to stay in Singapore. Even the pathways and roadside look lovely with wild flowers now. 🥰 Today, I’m eating pancake and decided to turn it into HDB flats. Then, I had a wild idea to include the Singapore skyline. Too wild indeed. 😅 Because I took a long time to complete it and got so hungry that I started munching on the pancake while drawing. By the time I finished, I only left with these 2 small pieces as HDB flats. 🤣🤣🤣 The most challenging part of this drawing is Singapore Flyer and Sir Stamford Raffles Statue! The most enjoyable part is drawing those hanged laundry outside the flats. Notice the variety of clothes there? 😬😬😬 Hope this little piece of chocolate food art brings you nice memories of your office surroundings if you are working in CBD area like me! 😍
