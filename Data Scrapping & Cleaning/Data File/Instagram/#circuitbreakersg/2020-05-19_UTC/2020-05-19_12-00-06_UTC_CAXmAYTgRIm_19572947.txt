It’s been 6 weeks since @littlemisschewy and @minimisschewy stopped attending school physically but the learning doesn’t stop! Even before the start of the circuit breaker period, NTUC First Campus’ My First Skool has been designing and sharing various home-based learning (HBL) activities to support the learning and development of children. MFS’ HBL kits are specially tailored for different age groups in mind, from infants to K2 children. In addition to the HBL lessons uploaded by the teachers, these activities are particularly useful in keeping the kids occupied when the adults are busy with work and household chores. The activities are engaging enough to keep them focused in their tasks, which gives the hubs and I a peace of mind.

Out of the different activities, the kids had the most fun creating puppets using recycled materials before working on a simple story script for “The Three Little Pigs” in both languages. MFS certainly makes things easier for parents during this difficult period of time by providing so many HBL activities.
