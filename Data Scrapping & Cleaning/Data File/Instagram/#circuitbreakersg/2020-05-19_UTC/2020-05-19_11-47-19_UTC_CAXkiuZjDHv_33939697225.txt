~ Tonkotsu Soybean Milk Udon ~ My first soymilk udon was in an Izakaya in downtown Montreal, together with sake bomb. Those happy pre-Simlets time. Lol. Today we had this for lunch. These days, happiness comes from them asking for second helping. :) #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #tonkotsu #soybeanmilk #udon #japanesefood #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #mymontrealstory #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
