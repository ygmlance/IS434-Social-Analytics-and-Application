🌊Blue Sensory Tray🐬
.
.
The second day of our BLUE theme started with sensory play in blue! 💦 The weather has been really hot lately, so we decided to use good ol’ water and blue water beads as the base. ☀️
.
.
In this edition, we added in water beads that were soaked overnight, blue bottle caps, blue sea creatures, water, and a drop of food colouring. Also used soap to create foam that mimicked waves 🌊 🐳🐬🐟🐋 And of course a variety of ladles and bottles for J to practise pouring, transferring and scooping (psychomotor skills and hand-eye coordination!) 👍🏼
.
.
15 minutes later, J decided he wanted a full-fledged ocean instead so we added all the other sea creatures in. Well, good that he now links the ocean to the colour blue! 🌟
