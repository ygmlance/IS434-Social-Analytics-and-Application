Baked curry puffs again. Partly because these were well-received by my family the last time I baked them, mainly because we received some love from our neighbour in the form of fruit tarts and we would like to reciprocate. These again have a curry chicken and potato filling. I adjusted the seasoning better today but need to improve on the dough. Meanwhile, happy to have some sharing and caring during this circuit breaker. 💖 Who else likes curry puffs? 🙋‍♀️ #circuitbreakersg day 43 #sugarlustsg #currypuff #karipap #epokepok #chickenpotato #asianfood #asianflavours #asiantaste #igsg #igsgfood #instafood #foodstagram #foodislove #fresh #homemade #homebaker #igbaker #instabaker #bakersofinstagram #sgbaker #sgbakes #weekdaybaking #tuesdayvibes #frommykitchen #madewithlove
