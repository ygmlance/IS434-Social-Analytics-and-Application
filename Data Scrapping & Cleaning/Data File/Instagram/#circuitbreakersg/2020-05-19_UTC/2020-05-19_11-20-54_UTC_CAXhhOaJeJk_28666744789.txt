One major takeaway I got from my older brother during this circuit breaker " Bodybuilding is a privilege, it is not an entitlement", this shook me hard upon self-reflection. It is important that we keep our body healthy and fit but at the same time, we should take a step back to think what's the sole purpose of bodybuilding What do you guys think? ðŸ˜¬#throwback
