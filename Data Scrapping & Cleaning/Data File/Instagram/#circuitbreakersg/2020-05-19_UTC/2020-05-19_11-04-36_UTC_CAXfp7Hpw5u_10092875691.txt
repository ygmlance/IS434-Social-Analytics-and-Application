Is professional teeth cleaning a “non-essential” treatment? 🤔
Professional dental cleans are in fact very essential dental treatments. Just that the risk of contracting COVID-19 is too great to justify leaving home at the moment. Brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day is vital but not sufficient to maintain good oral hygiene. Dental plaque and tartar cannot be removed by the toothbrush or floss. The dentist needs to remove them professionally. Cleans should not be delayed beyond 6 months as the build-up of plaque and tartar can lead to caries and gum disease. Gum disease has in turn been associated with very serious medical problems. Once professional dental cleans are permitted by the MOH, make sure to book yourself in. Take care of your teeth… and your body!
