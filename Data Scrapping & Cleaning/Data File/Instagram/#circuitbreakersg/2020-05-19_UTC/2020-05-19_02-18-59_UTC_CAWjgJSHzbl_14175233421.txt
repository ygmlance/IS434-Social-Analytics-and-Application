Posted @withregram • @wensdelight #CircuitBreakerSg Day 21! Tonight’s dinner for the family was unagi, teriyaki chicken balls and tamago pan grilled on my pinky #brunohotplate served with miso clams soup, vegetables and Hokkaido rice! Simple and delicious! 😋

Thank you @9sseafood for the flower clams & the big and fleshy unagi! So good! 😍
