Day 43 : Throw back 2009ğŸ™ƒFirst year as a makeup artist, I worked with a fashion designer from Indonesia for her new collections. ğŸ‘—The event was in Raffles Hotel and I met this beautiful model from Venezuela. I remembered she told me she wasnâ€™t beautiful enough to be a beauty queen in Venezuela, but I think she is really beautiful, isnâ€™t it? ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥° #stayhomestaysafe #circuitbreakersg #fightcovid19together #bestoftheday  #sgmakeup #sgmakeupartist  #sgig #sgigbeauty #instamakeup  #love #instagood #onlinemakeupcourse #beautiful #instadaily  #like4like #thelittlebrushmakeup #jovietanmakeupartist #throwback #tbt
