Itâ€™s the 7th week of the circuit breaker, here is another Car Care tip!

#5 Keep the Interior Clean

Insect infestation might be possible especially in long time immobile vehicles. We recommend that you do vacuum, clean up and disinfect the interior of your vehicle. Turn on the air-conditioning and let it run for approximately 10 minutes to help in filtering the air inside the vehicle.

Hang in there, we are almost there! Take care and Stay Safe!
