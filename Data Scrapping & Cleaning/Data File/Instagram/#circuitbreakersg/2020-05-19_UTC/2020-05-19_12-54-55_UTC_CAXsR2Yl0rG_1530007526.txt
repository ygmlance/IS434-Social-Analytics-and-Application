🐖🥣🅱︎🅰︎🅺︎ 🄺🅄🅃 🆃︎🅴︎🅷︎ for Day 43 CB. This is almost as easy as cooking instant noodles because once you've dumped all the spare ribs in the pot, all you need to do is leave it alone till it's almost ready to eat. Yup, even noob cooks can make this!😂 Firstly, blanche your spare ribs in boiling water to get rid of the scum. Throw away the water and rinse the ribs under cold water. Fill the pot with 1.5l of water, add 8 cloves of garlic, 1 tbsp white peppercorns, close the lid, bring to a rapid boil. Then bring to the lowest mark to continue to boil at low heat for 1 hour.

After 1 hour, discard the spice sachet. Close and return to boil at low heat for another 40 minutes. This is so that your soup doesn't taste too thick with the spice yet the meat is tender enough to fall off the bone. Add 1 tsp of salt to taste.

The only thing missing here is youtiao. 😏 Serve with your favourite veggies🥬 and for the dipping sauce, a mix of dark and light soy sauce with chilli padi🌶️. This is real comfort food! 😋
