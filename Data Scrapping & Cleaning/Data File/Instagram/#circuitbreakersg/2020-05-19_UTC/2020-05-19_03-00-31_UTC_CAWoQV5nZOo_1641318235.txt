Bel: Love Mama Earth as inhabitants of her 📷⁣
Bray: Love Me, Love Me Please 💟⁣
⁣
Every day should be Earth Day and not just an annual event. Here's the proud kiddos with their completed "Show Your Love to Mama Earth" Poster after Online Lesson 2 with @MuzArtSingapore 🎨🏡⁣
As with the previous week, Bel with Teacher Tomato, and Bray with Teacher Chili.⁣
⁣
The age appropriate classes had them introduced to egg shell and teabag art. I couldn't relate at first when their material list called for whole egg shells (it ain't Easter anymore 🤪), amongst other recyclable items such as cereal box carton which formed the base of their works, bubble wraps from my last courier package, empty polymer bags from their biscuit snacks, toilet rolls and apple seeds (yeah, Bel dug those out herself) and a bunch of green beans stolen from my pantry. So adapting to each of their age groups, they learnt about egg shell (and tea bag) art at different depths. 🥚🥚⁣
⁣
Of course they learnt more about Mama Earth too, with captivating videos in between their hands-on time making their posters. I only had more pictures with Bray as he needed more help with the tiny items and applying Uhu glue. Bel was more independent and sat through the class earnestly, with giggles in-between, while making her version of the poster. I think their artwork each has a different character but both equally filled with energetic vibes, don't ya agree? 🌏⁣
⁣
The kiddos also had extended activities from their teachers, such as Making a Pledge to Mama Earth, and recapping real life situations how to apply the 3Rs they learnt.
