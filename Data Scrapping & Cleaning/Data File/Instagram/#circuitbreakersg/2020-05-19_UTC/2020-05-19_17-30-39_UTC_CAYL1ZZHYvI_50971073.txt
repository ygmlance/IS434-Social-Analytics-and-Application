Finally tried doing Mee Rebus today... not fantastic but i still enjoys it... .
Dinner was simple... had a one bowl all-in dinner... Fried Vege Fritters + Omelette + Tau Kwa + KaiLan + Iberico Pork + Mee Rebus Gravy leftover from lunch... the shallots and spring onion really levels up the flavours... #circuitbreakersg Day 43
