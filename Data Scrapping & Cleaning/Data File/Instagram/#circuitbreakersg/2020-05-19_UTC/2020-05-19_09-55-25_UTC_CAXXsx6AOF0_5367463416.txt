If you've been to our pop ups, you would have seen or even heard the loud whooshing sound of this high heat, high pressure steamer that we use to rid of the dirt and germs in the fabric of baby strollers and car seats. ⁠
⁠
This high heat sanitisation is an essential step to all of our wash treatments. ⁠
⁠
High-temperature heat treatment ensures the reduction of 99.9% of germs and sticky stains from the fabric which is perfectly baby safe with no chemicals involved. ⁠
⁠
⁠
This could be what your washing machine is missing out when you attempt cleaning at home! ⁠
