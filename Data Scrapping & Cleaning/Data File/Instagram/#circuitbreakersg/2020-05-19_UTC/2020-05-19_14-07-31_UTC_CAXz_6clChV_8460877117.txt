This plank challenges underutilized muscles in a whole new way. The core consists of other muscles apart from the 6 pack abs in the front, such as the glutes, hip abductors and adductors and extensors of the back. These muscles fire the posterior chain which will help athletic performance and improve our posture and are often overlooked in core training. 
If you have worst or shoulder problems, try tweaking your hand position by going onto your elbows or rotating your wrists. Drive your heels into the ground and hips towards the ceiling!
