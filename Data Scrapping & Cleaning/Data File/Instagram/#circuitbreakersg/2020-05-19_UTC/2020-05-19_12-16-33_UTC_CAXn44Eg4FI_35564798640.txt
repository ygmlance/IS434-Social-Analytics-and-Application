Posted @withregram • @breadboooo Ah Ma’s Original Yam Cake ($15/500g)// Thank you for sending these over!! Okay first off, let me jusy say that l’m usually not an orh kueh person. Mainly because its yam flavour tends to be pretty mild and it usually tastes too starchy. Like yeah I’ll eat it but give me orh nee any day pls. BUT THIS YAM KUEH THOUGH. Dare I say one of the best yam kuehs I’ve ever had. The seasoning and flavour were on point - not too salty and super fragrant and flavourful. And love how Ah Ma is so generous with the fillings?!?! This yam kueh was brimming with yam cubes, salted prawn, minced pork, mushrooms and fried shallots!! Ugh, so gooooood. Am really wowed by how much I like it. 
If y’all do order this, do yourselves a favour and PAN FRY THEM. And then watch them transform into golden crisp blocks of yammy goodness. U’re welcome.

Just some feedback - would have been great if sweet sauce and chili were given as well.
