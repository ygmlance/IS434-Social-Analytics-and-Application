Is home cooked food #healthier? 😋
.
Restaurant meals can contain lots of unhealthy ingredients. There is also a lot beyond what’s in the meal that you miss out on when you’re eating from a take-out box.
.
🤷Why you should consider #cooking for yourself? 🤷‍♀️
.
👉🏻It’s proven to be healthier 🎉
people who cook more often, rather than get take-out, have an overall healthier diet🤗
.
👉🏻It’s easier to watch your calories
And if you thought independent restaurants and smaller chains do any better, think again. Those eateries pump in even more #calories😆
.
👉🏻It can be a money saver
In the long run, preparing #meals at home may save you money. A group of basic ingredients often comes in at a lower price tag than a single restaurant dish. You can also end up getting more meals out of a recipe you make at home than if you order takeout, or have leftovers to take to work the next day. After just a few weeks, you could see noticeable savings start to pile up.
.
👉🏻It’s #personalized🎊
Cooking at home gives you the opportunity to eat the foods you love exactly how you enjoy eating them.
.
Yeah lets learn how to make our own meal 😋💪🏻
