“Taking a picture just doesn’t give me the same retention or lusciousness,” says Susan Olij. The Singapore-based artist and teacher has travelled the world with her sketchbook and watercolors, capturing her impressions of places such as Oaxaca and Havana to Naoshima and Yangon. Not only does sketching encourage her to pay more attention to her surroundings, it’s had an unexpected benefit while being on lockdown: “I remember more vividly how I felt then, when I go back to my sketchbooks of those places.” Susan teaches short travel sketching courses at Lasalle.
