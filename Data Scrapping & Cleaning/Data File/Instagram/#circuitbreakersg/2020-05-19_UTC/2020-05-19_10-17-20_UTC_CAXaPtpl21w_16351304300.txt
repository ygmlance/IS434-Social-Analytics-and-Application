If you’ve been on the hunt for good pizza during this circuit breaker, we have a suggestion for you!  Pizzaboy, a home-grown brand, has been in operation since 2016. Their aim is to be recognised as the local pizza brand that offers good quality and affordable pizzas. They opened their first outlet at 116 Changi Road and has since expanded to 3 locations island-wide. 
Fun fact, Pizzaboy is Halal Certified by MUIS and has Vegetarian options as well. Keep an eye out for them as they continue to expand to locations near you!
Pizzaboy would like to say thank you for the opportunity to operate under these circumstances. While delivery orders have been good, they do have concerns about the safety of their workers and are taking the necessary precautions. 
Finally, they would like to say, Please stay safe! Practice good hygiene! 
Pizzaboy is open for takeaways and island-wide delivery.
