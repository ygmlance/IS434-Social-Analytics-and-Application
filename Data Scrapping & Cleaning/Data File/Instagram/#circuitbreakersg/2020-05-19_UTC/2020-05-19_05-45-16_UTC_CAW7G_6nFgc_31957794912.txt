Who loves mee hoon kueh (hand pulled noodles) as much as I do especially when they are home-made? Iâ€™m a carbo addict alright. Felt totally uninspired & wanted something soupy, so whipped up a simple meal of MHK with my signature meatballs, if I may say so ðŸ˜†. Always have had numerous requests on my recipe from the pork balls. Ok, so Iâ€™ve no recipe ( I donâ€™t follow recipes to a T) & i like to add diced squid or oysters (depending on your preference) or even dried sole fish n seasoning to make the balls- give them so much more flavor. Better yet, these balls can be fried n I assure you, they r oh so, moreish! Simply love the bite n chewiness of hand made MHK. Made some really spicy n sour chilli dip too - lovely. The soup is made from dried ikan bilis n soybeans which I just let it sit on the stove to simmer for an hour so that itâ€™s really tasty. 
Ps. My 2 fur babies are also into meat balls & theyâ€™ll always be the first to run into the kitchen whenever I make these. ðŸ˜…

I think all this massive load of cooking n baking has reignited my creative spark. Never had I completed so many music scores from the use of both my keyboard and flute. YES! ðŸ’ª Iâ€™m looking forward to these hymns to be played at church soon. ðŸ’œ
