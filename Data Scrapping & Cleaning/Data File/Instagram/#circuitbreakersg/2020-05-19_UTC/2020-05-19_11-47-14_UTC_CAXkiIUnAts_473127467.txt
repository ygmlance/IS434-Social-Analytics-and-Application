19 MAY 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 43

Day 43 - #circuitbreakersg
🥱
A lazy Tuesday....and don't feel like engaging in heavy cooking.
👩‍🍳
Today the kids had food that we have not tasted for a long time. (Even before circuit breaker)

Lunch - Pork Ball Porridge
Dinner - McDonalds (Kids) + KFC (Hubby)

We usually have KFC or Burger King and today is an unusual treat. Hubby is still a big supporter for the fried chicken. 😀 
Took me awhile to bring the food back but I don't mind having my soggy fries! Hahaha
