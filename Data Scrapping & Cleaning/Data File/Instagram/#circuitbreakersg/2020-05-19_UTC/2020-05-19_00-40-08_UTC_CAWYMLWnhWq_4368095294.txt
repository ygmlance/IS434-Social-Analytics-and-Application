☕CB Day43 - Breakfast☕
.
Trying this for the first time. .
The review: the Bao skin is nice, little Al dents, doesn't stick to your teeth. The chicken filling can be a little more generous. As the Bao named as Hainanese Chicken, so there's ginger; preferably to use sliced chicken instead of minced, coz the ginger caused the minced to soften and lost its texture.
.
Verdict: Unlikely will buy it again.
