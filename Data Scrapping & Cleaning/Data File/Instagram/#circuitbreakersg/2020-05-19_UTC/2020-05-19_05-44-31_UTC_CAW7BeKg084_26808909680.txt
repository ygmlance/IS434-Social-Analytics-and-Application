Last week, Mummy sang ABCDEFG randomly and I continued with HIJKLMMP. Mummy got a huge shock!! 🤭 So last night I started from A all the way to Z. Although some letters are still hard for me to pronounce but Mummy and Daddy are so proud of me! 😎 So we sang the ABC song many many times till I went to bed hahha~
