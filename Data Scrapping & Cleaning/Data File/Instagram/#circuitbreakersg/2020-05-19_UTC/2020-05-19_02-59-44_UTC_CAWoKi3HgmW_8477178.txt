These 3 are the most peaceful in the morning and always have this pretend play which eldest 👧🏻 is the teacher and 👦🏻🧒🏻 as students.

One morning 👧🏻 was carrying younger sis 🧒🏻 around and i asked..
👩🏻 H, are you teacher again?
👧🏻 No.
👩🏻 Teacher assistant?
👧🏻 No.
👩🏻 Principal?
👧🏻 No. Mama dun ask already...

I finally realised she was pretending to be MAMA (me!) cos she was dropping her kids off at school 😅

Didnt expect my role to be one my daughter will imitate. As much as i feel 泄气 at the end of (almost every) day, i think there are some good qualities of me the kids are subconsiously picking up and would like to follow 🥰
