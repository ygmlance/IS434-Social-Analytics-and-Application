[#HerStoryFitness] I've been snacking non-stop during the Circuit Breaker period, and my thighs have been growing sideways! How about you? 
Let's look for our missing slim thighs together by following these simple yoga stretches! Remember to tag your friends and exercise virtually together! Be sure to save this post so you can find it anytime!

Featuring @vivreactivewear 's Motive Active Crop Top and  Breathe Easy Performance Tights. I feel extremely comfortable when exercising in it and the material is of really good quality! The thing I like most is that there are pockets located in the thigh area unlike other brands, which is a great plus point! Check them out for a more versatile and well-curated range of activewear!
