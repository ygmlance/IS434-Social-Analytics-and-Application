So we’ve heard...we’re exiting #circuitbreakersg on 1st June (did 56 days almost zoomed past just like that?! 😔), and we’ll continue to mask-on 😷

Can you already tell this kiddo is all ‘bout “green” and “food” even when choosing his mask 🤣, and still loves twinning with mommy! 💚💚💚🥰 Our sushi-print twinning masks are 2-layer 100% cotton, and comes with nose wire and a slot for your filter - they’re delicately hand-sewn by @sewingformissa! 😍
{PSST, watch this space for an upcoming giveaway to win a set of these! 😜🥳}
