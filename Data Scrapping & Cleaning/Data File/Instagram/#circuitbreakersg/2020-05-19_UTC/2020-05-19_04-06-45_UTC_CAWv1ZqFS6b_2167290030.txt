DAY 42, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
MILO OATS AND CHIA

Here is another great way to have an oats breakfast, or even an evening snack, specially for kids.
Milo is an Sg favourite, and we cant do without it ðŸ˜‚
I cooked the oats in milk, disolved a sachet of 3in1 milo in a few tsp of warm water to make a thick paste, and mixed it with the oats.
I soaked chia seeds in milk, overnight.
Do not add sugar or honey if you are using 3in1 milo. 
Add fruits of your choice if you want.
Set it in layers to make it look attractive for kids ðŸ˜Š .
