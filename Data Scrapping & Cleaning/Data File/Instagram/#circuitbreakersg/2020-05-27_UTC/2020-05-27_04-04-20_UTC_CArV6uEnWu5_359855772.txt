The last time I attempted Pork Floss Spring Roll, I failed quite badly. Not sure if it's due to me using pork fluff instead of pork floss, or because of the random brand I used, the air fried pork 'floss' spring roll, tasted like rocks. 
Since this CB I have the time to spare, might as well give it another try. 
INGREDIENTS: • ½ packet of small spring roll pastry (125 mm x 125 mm ) - quartered
• 250g of pork floss
• 2 tablespoon oil
• some water or a beaten egg (to seal the spring roll)

DIRECTIONS: • Put 1/2 teaspoon of pork floss to lower end of every quartered pieces of spring roll skin (in diamond shape orientation)
• Fold the lower ends of the skin up to form a double triangle • Fold the sides inwards to form an envelope
• Roll tightly and seal the top edges with water or beaten egg
• Preheat the air fryer at 180 degree Celsius (5 mins before frying)
• Lay the rolls onto a tray and lightly brush the spring roll skin with oil
• Layered them into the basket without overlapping (divide the rolls into batches)
• Air fry the rolls for 8 mins at 180 degree celcius
• Pull out the basket and shake halfway during frying so that any overlay bits will be air fried too
