I have been doing a variety of yoga classes for 15 days in the morning or noon.

Today, I've decided to switch to something else and test what Yoga have improved, in term of physical functionality.

Its my first time using hiit down dog app so i didn't want to give myself something over the top. 
All settings are at lvl 1.
20min with 30/10 seconds.

I feel like i could definitely do more. so I will probably end the day with a gentle flow yoga class later in the evening.

All in all, I'm definitely happy with what 15 days of yoga did to me.
