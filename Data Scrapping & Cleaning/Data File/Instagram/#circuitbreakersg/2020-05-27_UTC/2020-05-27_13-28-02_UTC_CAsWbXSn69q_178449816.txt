Day 51 of #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a helping hand is extended, make the most of it. Because you never know if they plan on actually helping you, or are plucking out the raisins instead.
.
Featured here are oat raisin cookies. Good to make if you are short on flour but have spare oats. Will add the recipe if anyone is interested.
