My very first #homebaker purchase from @shesells.seashells.sg 🐚💕got her bakesale set ($38) that comes with matcha Yuzu madeleines 🍵 🍋, pickled cherry blossom financier 🌸, pistachio and macadamia cookie 🍪🤩 super love the cherry blossom financier ~ you can taste the infused condensed milk flavor 🥛✨ the pistachio is great for nutty lover 🥜the matcha Yuzu is just the best of both world✨🥰 I love the sweet note and this really makes a great treatself or carepack for your friends🙆‍♀️( I shared some with my friend so it’s missing a set haha! There are 4 of each pastry!)
