27 MAY 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 51

Day 51 - #circuitbreakersg
✍
Come to think about it... I have been pretty accustom to circuit breaker probably because I have been in CB mode through childhood. Spending my holidays in the house drawing alot. 😉
#anime drawing is one of the skill I picked up then cos you only need a pencil and maybe a black marker. 😀
It feels good to draw again and remembering a passion that I always have
