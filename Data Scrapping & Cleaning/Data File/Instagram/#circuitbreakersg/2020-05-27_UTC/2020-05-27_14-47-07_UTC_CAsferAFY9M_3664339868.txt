In a time when it seemingly looks like the rug has been pulled from under our feet and stability appears to be compromised, wisdom remains the age-old friend that keeps us sound and empowered.

Raise Your Voice is a series of 12 20-min FB Live Sessions curated to build wisdom for practically navigating a new world ahead of COVID19.

With four different themes every week, we will also have guest speakers peppered at certain sessions to share insights from their different industries, backgrounds, and life experiences.

Wisdom will say that in times of peace or in waves of the storms, it is always a good time to learn.
