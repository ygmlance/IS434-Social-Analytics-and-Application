“Didi copy me!” You’ve probably heard this whine a gazillion times like me if you have young children at home. (Make that two gazillion if the age gap is two years or less!) Why do kids imitate their elder siblings? Should you try to stop such behaviour?

We imitate those we love - this is at the heart of most sibling mimicry. Young children see their abang or jiejie doing things that they want to do, so they start by copying that behaviour until they figure out how to do it themselves. This is known as the social learning theory.

I’ve seen this happening many times with my K2 son - for instance, peeping over his elder brother’s shoulder when he’s reading or attending an online class. I initially dismissed this as another of those annoying, harmless antics younger kids get up to, until he surprised me by solving his brother’s P1 math problem on the spot. Then one night, Mr. Cheeky Copycat - who’s nothing like the avid reader his gor gor is - actually started reading a Geronimo Stilton book aloud!

So, congratulations, your adorable yet annoying forever-baby-of-the-family is probably learning secretly all the time. On the flipside, it’s perfectly natural for the elder sibling being imitated to feel annoyed and exasperated (hence the gazillion whines). We find it helps to explain that this is an expression of their sibling’s love, and they should take it as a compliment and try to be a role model. Until the copying starts again, and the whine-o-meter continues counting to infinity...
