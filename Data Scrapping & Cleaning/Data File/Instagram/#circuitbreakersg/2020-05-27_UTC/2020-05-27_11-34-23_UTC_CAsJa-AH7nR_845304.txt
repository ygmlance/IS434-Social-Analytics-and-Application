This barren piece of land used to be pretty well maintained -⁣
Flat land, short grass, prim and proper, just like everything Singapore is.⁣
⁣
51 days of CB later, it’s now this lush mess of overgrown grass, wild bouquets of shrubs, dotted with yellow and white flowers in the midst. Smells fresh too.⁣
⁣
Some of the unexpected urban outfield experience thanks to CB.⁣
⁣
Also, thankful for good running weather today. :)⁣
