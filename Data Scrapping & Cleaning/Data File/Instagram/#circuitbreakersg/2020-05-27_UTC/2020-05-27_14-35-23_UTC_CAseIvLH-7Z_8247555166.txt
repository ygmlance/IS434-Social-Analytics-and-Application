Ordered some steamed buns from @smhfoodsg‘s official store at @shopee_sg! 🍞
✨
Got the honey bbq chicken and coffee paus! I prefer the former as the dough is very soft and fluffy. The filling is also 👍🏻 with huge chunks of bbq chicken within. It’s quite similar to those served in dim sum restaurants, or maybe even better than some IMO! As for the latter, it’s quite fragrant but I’ll prefer it to be more intense in coffee aroma. I like that the filling isn’t too sweet, but the dough portion is a little too chewy for my liking! 🍗☕️

These 2 flavours aren’t available in supermarkets, but you can get them from @shopee_sg to be delivered to your doorstep! My delivery reached me the next day after I ordered! Super prompt! 🚚
