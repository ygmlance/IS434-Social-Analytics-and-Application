#stretchyfit100 halfway there! Had to dance my way through again ðŸ˜‚ It was hard to keep form even though I was actually doing it really slowly so I just did 50. I don't want to aggravate my lower back issues. I pay back the reps I didn't complete sometime in the future maybe never ? Hahaha Just having there's no prize except the knowledge that I gave it a try! â€¢
