Weâ€™re back with more single-pan recipes, this time, it's an egg sandwich with a twist! This One-Pan Egg Sandwich is wrapped in a warm omelette burrito and oozing with cheese from the centre. Hereâ€™s the full recipe.

Ingredients:
4 eggs
Salt
Black pepper
1 tbsp butter
2 slices bread
Shredded cheese
Ham slices
Bell peppers, chopped
Rocket leaves

Steps:
1. Crack four eggs into a bowl and beat them, seasoning well with salt and pepper.
2. In a frying pan over medium heat, melt one tablespoon of butter before pouring in the beaten eggs. Tilt the pan to evenly spread out the egg.
3. Immediately place two pieces of bread into the egg mixture and flip them around after one side is coated. Let the egg cook for one to two minutes.
4. Using a large spatula, flip the entire omelette over and let the egg cook on the other side.
5. Sprinkle shredded cheese, chopped bell peppers, ham, or other ingredients of your choice onto one half of the omelette.
6. Using a spatula, fold over the excess omelette wings such that it looks like a long rectangle.
7. Fold the rectangle in half by flipping one slice of bread over the other. Cut the sandwich in half and serve.
