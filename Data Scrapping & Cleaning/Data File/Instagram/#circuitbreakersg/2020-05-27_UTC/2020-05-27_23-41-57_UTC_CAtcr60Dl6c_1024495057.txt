The calm and quiet of the house before I do my daily chores.

Almost a decade ago, I received the red elephant from @jhwphay, which I have kept all these years but don't know what to do with 😅

Look it finally has a home now....on my tray 🤭

What did you do with yours @laneylian? Putting the pressure on you 😅

Happy Thursday everyone❤️❤️❤️ Sending positive vibes... 💕
