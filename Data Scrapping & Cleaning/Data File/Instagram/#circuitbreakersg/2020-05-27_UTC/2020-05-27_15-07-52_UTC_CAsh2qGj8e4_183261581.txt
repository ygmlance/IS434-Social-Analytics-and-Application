#furkidwalks #morningvibes 
Lovely cool morning so brought furry kid out for stroll and his first encounter was a cutie feline hibernating among some scrubs n ferns. He sniffed n spotted it and as usual tried aggressively to get to it ðŸ˜‚
Feline was equally aggro and never flinched n instead laid down on its fours and stared back at furry kidðŸ˜‚
Next was another beauty he tried as well... unable to video him chasing after it... butterfly was too quick for furrykid n meðŸ¤£
