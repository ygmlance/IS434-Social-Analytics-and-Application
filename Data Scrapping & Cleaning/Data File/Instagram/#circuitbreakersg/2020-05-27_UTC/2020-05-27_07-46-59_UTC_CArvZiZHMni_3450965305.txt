The circuit breaker is slowly ending and entering of phase one of the softening approach!
.
.Clement's heading back to school soon and I've been lazy in teaching him the past week coz I'm down with really bad migraines... Feeling much better now, today I've decided to do a DIY alphabet threading game for the boy to memorise his ABCs by heart! Swipe to see video of him singing the abc song on repeat while he's doing the threading:)
.
.Reinforcing is key!!! Since his attention span is really short and he doesn't like to think so hard on lessons, he tend to give random answers sometimes even though he already knows the answer... Which makes me worry for him constantly... So, I gotta drag out my own lazy butt to teach him as much as I can now at home!
.
.P.S It is through the last parents-teacher call that I learnt this boy cannot sit still in class! Hais ðŸ¤¦ And although the teacher praised him for his vocabulary and articulation, he's got one of the worst attention span... Simi sia?!!! Cannot sit still nevermind, still go around and disturb his classmates somemore! Too bad the teachers are not allowed to spank kids! Otherwise I'd gladly allow them to do so!!!
