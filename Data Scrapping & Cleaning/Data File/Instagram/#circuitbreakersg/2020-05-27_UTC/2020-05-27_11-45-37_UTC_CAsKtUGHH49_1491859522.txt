MURPH. 53:12.
*
My yearly ritual, this time done together with my fellow cobras via Google Meet.
*
Thank you my fellow Ace Brigade family for grunting out with me through this. Good to know that we're all still fit! ACE SETS THE PACE!
*
In memory of Lt. Michael Murphy, who was the leader of a Navy Seal Recon team and sacrified his life in Afghanistan to save his team members.
