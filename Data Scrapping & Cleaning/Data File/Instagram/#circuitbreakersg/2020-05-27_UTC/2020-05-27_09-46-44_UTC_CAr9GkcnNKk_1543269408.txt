New York from Liberty Island, New York, 2019.
.
So close, yet so far. You can imagine the relief when one saw land as the ship passed the Statue of Liberty. You’ve made it, you’ve survived the treacherous journey. Yet, as you are quarantined on Ellis island, despondency sets in, doubts of a better life creep in as you don’t know if you will even set foot in America.
.
Our #circuitbreakersg is a little like that. Little less than a week before it ends BUT is it really ending? I won’t be able to waltz into my local for a drink or a Coffeeshop for a meal; I won’t be able to meet my friends and family for whatever reason; until they say it’s safe to do so. They say virtual is the new normal; but the physical interaction is what makes us human. I don’t want “SkyNet”.
