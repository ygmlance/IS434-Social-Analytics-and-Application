This is what happen when I don't do any bakingðŸ˜–
.
Usually during the downtime that we have, we would sometime do inventory check and prep what is needed to be done.
.
Not only that I would spend the time probably with my husband, parents or family. Or just sit down doing nothing & start scratching(scrollingðŸ¤ª) the phone
.
So yesterday, I watched a live on bedsheet (so typical like my mom already) and their designs. .
OMG! I spent almost 3 hours watching their live just to wait for the size & design I wanted ðŸ˜…
.
Initially I only wanted to buy bedsheet, but I'm stuck. .
I continue purchased blanket, pillow case & on top of that I won their lucky draw. .
Which is an espresso maker (worth it lah)ðŸ¤£
