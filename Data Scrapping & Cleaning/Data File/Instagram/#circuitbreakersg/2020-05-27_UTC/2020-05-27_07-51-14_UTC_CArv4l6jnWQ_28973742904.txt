Kitsune Soba is Mr Kâ€™s favourite style of soba as he likes the simplicity of the slightly al-dente soba noodles soaked in katsuo dashi (bonito stock), topped with pieces of inari age (seasoned sheets of fried tofu skin) and scallions.
.
Recipe for homemade katsuo dashi: - Add 15g of dried bonito flakes in pot of 1 litre of water and bring it to a boil.
- Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
- Strain the dashi over a fine-mesh sieve.
- For seasoning, add 1 tbsp mirin, 1 tsp light soy sauce and 1/2 tsp of sea salt to the dashi.
