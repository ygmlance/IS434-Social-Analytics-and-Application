Day 49. Time really flies, especially this week. Low clouds as usual, and cool breeze as expected. Lunch - grilled lamb leg with capsicum. Missy loves this Jap sesame and chilli flakes recently. Told a photo of Nom when he was napping. Oh man, he has put on a lot of weight during this period! Evening sky is gold. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #mybunnyathome #instadaily
