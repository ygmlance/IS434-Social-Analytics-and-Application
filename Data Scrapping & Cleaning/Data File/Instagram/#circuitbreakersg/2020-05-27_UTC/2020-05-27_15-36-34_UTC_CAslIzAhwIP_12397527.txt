Lunch was late and impromptu, hence I had to come up with a quick version from scratch. This is a #shortcut #recipe and I just used whatever I had in my pantry. Here's what I did:

#AromacookeryRecipe30MinPasta
•
Ingredients:
1 small onion
200-250gm bacon
1 small can button mushrooms
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 can stewed/plum/chopped tomatoes
Dried Italian herb mix
Salt, sugar, pepper
Dried pasta (refer to *Note)
•
~ Prepare a big pot of water to boil pasta. Turn on the fire as this will take some time to come to a boil.
~ Chop up onion. Slice mushrooms in half. Cut bacon into strips.
~ In another frying pan, saute onions in some oil. When onions turn soft, add bacon.
~ Add button mushrooms and Italian herb mix.
~ Add tomato paste.
~ Add canned tomatoes. Use kitchen scissors to cut up the tomatoes so they break down faster.
~ Add half a can of water (use 🍅 can to measure, add more if you find the sauce too thick).
~ Season with salt, sugar (to temper the acidity) and some black pepper.
~ Cover and simmer over low fire until the sauce reduces/thickens.
~ Start boiling the pasta. Time your pasta to finish cooking after the sauce is ready, else the noodles will turn too soft.
~ Taste the sauce. Adjust flavours with more salt/sugar/pepper if needed.
~ Mix the pasta into the sauce, or just pour sauce over the noodles if you prefer.

*Note: I used 220gm dried pasta for 4 pax.
