[20.20 May 27: Circuit Breaker Day 51] On strike a few days but have to clear the fridge, so today's menu shall be Niku Udon. #SerenesCookbook2020

Ingredients:
Beef slices
Onions
Udon
Leftover Cha Shu marinade
Spring onions (garnish)

I bought the marinated beef slices from #DonDonDonki, fry it with onion and set aside.

Dilute the gravy to make into soup, boil Udon in it, top with beef slices, garnish with chopped spring onions and serve!  @rebeccaxseah thanks for the marinade. Perfect for Udon soup.
