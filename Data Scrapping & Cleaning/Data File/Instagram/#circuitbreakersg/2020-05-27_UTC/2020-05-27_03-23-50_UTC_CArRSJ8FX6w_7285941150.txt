Haii how’s everyone doing so far? ☀️ .

#socialdistancing #circuitbreaker .

So far i’ve been doing better that I thought i would be 🍃 Being at home a LOT more, makes me more grateful for the littlest of blessings, read more book, learn new skills, get in touch with fam and friends more, journaling and one of the things i love is that i can finally take nap haha🎐 .

What is your favourite activity during circuit breaker? .

Hope everyone is doing well and I pray that we will all stay safe, happy and healthy always ☀️ .
