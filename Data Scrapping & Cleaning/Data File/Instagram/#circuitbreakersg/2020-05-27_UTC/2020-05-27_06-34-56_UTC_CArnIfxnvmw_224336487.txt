How is everyone doing with their home workout routines?

From yesterday's session led by @geniemule and @nurulsuhaila, if you guys missed it.

Squats & Front Kicks
4 direction Frog Jumps
Lunges & Side Kicks
Sit ups & Punches
Lateral Walk Push-ups
Commandos
Side Plank Leg Raisers 
Repeat x 3 no break in between

I only videoed the first exercise. Hahaha.
Have fun guys!!! The 4 direction Frog Jumps killed me!

Anyways, a tiny note. Dont give up on your workouts! Keep going!
