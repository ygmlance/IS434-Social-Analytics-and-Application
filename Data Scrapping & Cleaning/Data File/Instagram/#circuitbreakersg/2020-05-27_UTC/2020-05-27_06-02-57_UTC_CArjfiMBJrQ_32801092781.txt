Circuit breaker Day 51: Sarawak kolo mee & laksa 👍👍👍 Very authentic and superrrrr tasty Sarawak fare. Noodles were springy, flavour of the curry in the laksa was on point. Each item was $5, very value for money & way more worth than JiaXiang. Would totally buy this again, can’t believe I didn’t find this earlier!
