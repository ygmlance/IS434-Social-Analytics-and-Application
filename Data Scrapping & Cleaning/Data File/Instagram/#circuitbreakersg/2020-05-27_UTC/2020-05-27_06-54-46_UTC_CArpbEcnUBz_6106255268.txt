Hi there! This is a note to all who wrote in requesting to collaborate or become a stockist at Essential Extra & Ship Of Time.
.
We received several requests & we are unable to reply to each of you. Sorry. We are a very small team & we just can't cope.
.
At this point, we will not be accepting new brands or collaborations. We are not in a rush & made a conscious decision to take care of the vendors who are already with us. We do from time to time edit & review our product & vendor mix, but that will likely be towards end 2020, or when #circuitbreakersg is over for good.
.
Our priority is to make sure we come out stronger with what we already have - our vendors, staff & resources - instead of adding more. The world is changing. We don't need more, we need deep and meaningful engagement. I think we are heading towards the right path. Slowing down to appreciate the seeming ordinary.
.
We have become what we are today because of each & everyone of you who shopped with us & remembered us. So thank you. And sorry for this insensitive mass reply. We will see you very soon. #hanginthere
