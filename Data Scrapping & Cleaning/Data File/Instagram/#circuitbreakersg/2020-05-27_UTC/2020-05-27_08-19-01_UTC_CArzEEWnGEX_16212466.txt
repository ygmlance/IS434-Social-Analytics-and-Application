I'm happy because Korean Fried Chicken has 'Crash Landed On Me'!🥰 ⁣
⁣
I've been thinking about fried chickens ever since watching a few K-dramas during this CB period, especially after binge-watching the super popular 'Crash Landing On You'!🤩 ⁣
⁣
For the wings, I just marinate them with soy sauce, ginger juice, sugar, garlic, yellow onion and coat them with corn starch for deep-frying. About the sauce, just fry some diced yellow onion and garlic for 1 minute and then add gochujang, spicy chili sauce, sugar and sesame oil. Simple and yummy! 😋
