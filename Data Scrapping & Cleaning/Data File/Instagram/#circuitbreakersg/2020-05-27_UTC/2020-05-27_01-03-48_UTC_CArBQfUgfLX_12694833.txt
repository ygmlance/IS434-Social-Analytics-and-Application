MY IMPROMPTU OKONOMIYAKI
.
.
Lazy to buy breakfast this morning, I suddenly decided to use up some of my pre-washed (with vinegar water) cabbage that is sitting in my fridge for so long.  Surprisingly, they still look and taste ok.
.
.
Other than the key ingredient cabbage, mayonnaise and bonito flakes are significant ingredients that contribute to that classic okonomiyaki flavour and taste! MUST-HAVE!

The ingredients I used are: .
ğŸ”¸Cabbage, thinly sliced (I didnâ€™t measure, I used about 10 leaves I think)
ğŸ”¸Carrots, shredded (just a handful for colour)
ğŸ”¸80g All purpose flour
ğŸ”¸10g corn flour
ğŸ”¸3g sugar
ğŸ”¸1/2 tsp salt
ğŸ”¸1/2 cup water
ğŸ”¸1 egg
.

Toppings:
ğŸ”ºMayonnaise
ğŸ”ºDark soya sauce
ğŸ”ºBonito flakes
ğŸ”ºBlack pepper

Mix all the ingredients up and pour and spread everything evenly into a non-stick pan with some vegetable oil and cook the pancake on both sides. . (I made a mistake by cooking my cabbages in the pan first and ended up with some burnt pieces)
