Last few days in lockdown (circuit breaker)! Time for a reflection: ⁣
⁣
I haven't said much about how I'm doing so far, but I'm ok. My initial reaction to being alone for 2 months was panic, but I slowly got used to (and maybe comfortable) being with myself. My new favourite activity is online board games now, while video-calling friends I haven't spoken to in ages.⁣
⁣
The downsides are forgetting to eat sometimes because there's nobody around to give me a semblance of mealtime, and forgetting to exercise because I'm just plain lazy and I usually pick making music over fitness. ⁣
⁣
My gigs were cancelled and this pandemic made me realise that I'm lucky I didn't depend on gigs for my full income. I'm also grateful to some of the people and organizations (@carousell.sg, @cr8studiosg, @creativenationsingapore, @jonanwong, @souldotsg, @acappella_allstars, @iamfallingfeathers, @pinkflamingorecords, @apollomusicsociety, @jurongopenmic etc.) that gave me a chance to do something online with my music in this time. ⁣
⁣
I know there's gonna be a new normal but don't you find it kinda exciting to be living through a pandemic and being able to experience this first-hand instead of reading about it in your history books or watching it in dystopian films? ⁣
⁣
Anyway, I'm trying to make my music sustainable even during a pandemic, so I've recently started a @patreon where my arrangements and audio files are readily available. If that's something you're interested in, or if you want/are able to support my passion for a small amount, please head over to the third link in my bio. ⁣
⁣
Otherwise, if you want to support me but can't do so monetarily, likes, comments, shares and follows on any or all of my platforms are always welcome :) ⁣
⁣
You made it to the end of the chunk, thanks for reading! ⁣
