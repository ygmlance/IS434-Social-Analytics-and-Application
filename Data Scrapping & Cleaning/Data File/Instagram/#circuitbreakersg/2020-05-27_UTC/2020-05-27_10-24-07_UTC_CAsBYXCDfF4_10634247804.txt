I’ve swam over 30 km (19 miles) in my 13 meter (39 foot) lap pool in the last 3.5 weeks. Tomorrow, I’ll knock out the final 2.9 km and successfully complete my May goal: swimming the English Channel virtually. #stayfocused #swimmingkeepsmesane #theconquerorchallenge #swimming #stayhomestaysafe #quarantinelife #quarantine #circuitbreakersg #goals #stayfit #stayfitdontquit #metime
