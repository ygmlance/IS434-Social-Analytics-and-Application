Weâ€™re just a few days from the end of the circuit breaker (even though it really doesnâ€™t change much considering most of us canâ€™t go back to work or go to the mall or even eat out) and Iâ€™ve been having A LOT of random thoughts. I decided to turn one of them into a doodle because it felt super profound and my mind started going off on it and thus I just needed to put it in a visual form (simplistically of course). Swipe to read the little thought nugget that I just had to pen down but was too long to put in an Instagram caption so I took screenshots and added it after my doodle (which was inspired by those thoughts) ðŸ˜Š
