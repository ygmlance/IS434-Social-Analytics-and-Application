Little boat upon the sea, I wonder where you would take me... ⚓⛵🐳🐠
Unsure of what the future holds amidst the whirlwind in the world out there, but I'm thankful & grateful for today & everyday of #circuitbreakersg as the nation stayed home and we get to spend more time with our loved ones. Hope everyone is staying well and safe too! ❤
