Hank Mobley / Lee Morgan - Peckin’ Time, 1958. Is this record underrated cuz it’s a double bill? Both Hank and a young Lee Morgan are very good here but I’d give Wynton Kelly equal billing as well. For me, he ran the show on the piano and gave the headliners the platform to show how good they are. I think this record would sell better with just Hank headlining. He did most of the work anyway writing 4 of the 5 tracks.  #hankmobley #leemorgan #peckintime #wyntonkelly #paulchambers #charliepersip #bluenoterecords
