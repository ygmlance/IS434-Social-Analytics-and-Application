I got tired of trying to keep up with counting how many skips Iâ€™ve made with the skipping rope so I bought one with a counter.  This came with a rope less option which works great for indoor skipping and for the occasional klutz that I am who trips over the rope. ðŸ¤ª

With this, Iâ€™ve been able to clock more skips as I donâ€™t have to concentrate and remember which number I was at. Itâ€™s quite liberating. With the calorie counter, it is also quite motivating to see what Iâ€™m theoretically burning. Itâ€™s a huge plus to be able to skip in the living room without the constant whipping sound of the rope. I can finally watch some show with the family and concentrate on the show!

AND the boys have been intrigued by this counter and theyâ€™ve borrowed it to skip too. Another indoor energy burner for the win!
