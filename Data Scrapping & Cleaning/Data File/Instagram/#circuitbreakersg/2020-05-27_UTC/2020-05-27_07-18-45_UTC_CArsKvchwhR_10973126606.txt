Anyone heard of Korean Braised Egg? After seeing @omad.log video on the making of eggs in soy broth, I couldn't wait to try it out myself.

It was so good! Definitely making it in a bigger batch next time.

For those who asked, here's the recipe!

5 hard boiled eggs, shells removed
50g brown sugar
100ml water
100ml soy sauce
half big onion (diced)
half spring onion (cut)
one red chili (cut)

How to‚ùì
1Ô∏è‚É£ Mix brown sugar, water and soy sauce together.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add in big onions, spring onion and red chili. Mix them all well together.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Lastly, add in the hard boiled eggs and leave in the fridge for at least 6 to 24 hours.
