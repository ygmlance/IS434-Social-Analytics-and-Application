We are going to start resting up and calming our nervous system in June. 
The extended lockdown brings about a lot of mixed feelings. Research has shown that a drastic change in circumstances and facing the unknown will cause immense stress in the body and mind.

June is a recuperative month at #yicsingapore.

We invite you to join Cat every Tuesday night for a restorative practice to release, relax and rejuvenate ✨

Drop in students are welcome ⭐️ Please pay $10 via PayPal to contact@yicsingapore.com

Restorative Yoga Tuesday | 8pm - 9pm
