My family is a big fan of teochew fishball noodles, hence when @ahhuateochewnoodle offer scheduled islandwide delivery, i knew i had to jump on the wagon.
.
The food travelled very well from the far west to our home in the east. We were surprised it arrived so warm, considering the time it sat on the road before it reached us. The noodles were al dente and did not clumped tog.
.
Little foodie and I had the bee tai mak, which was very fragrant and tasty esp after we gave it a good toss to wake up the sauce as well as balance out the fried pork lard and its seasonings. I love how everything is handmade right to the silky fish dumping (herh kiao) and bouncy fishballs. They even had the ‚Äòrippled fish ruler‚Äô and fish rolls, wrapped with carrot and cucumbers inside.
.
Tho i found myself reaching for water after the meal, this is one bowl of noodle we will travel to the west for, once the CB eases up!üçúüòã
