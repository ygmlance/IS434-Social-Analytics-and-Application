📖💬⁠FOMO-ing from missing my IG live storytelling? I can’t rewind the clock but we CAN relive it on IGTV! 😝
.
🔊The audio from IGTV was not in sync and I was reluctant to share that as it wouldn’t make for a comfortable watch, butttttt hallelujah, my brother did a screen recording! 🥳
.
📲 I couldn’t read most the comments then, since we had to use the back-facing camera most of the time to ensure the words were right side up (the front facing camera automatically mirror flips, which is NOT conducive when you’re showing text/words) 📷
.
💖 Now though, I can finally see the comments, answers and hearts that the live home audience was sending, and reading them gives me a happy bubbly feeling! 🥰
.
👩‍👧‍👦Even better are the photos and videos that some of you shared, showing your little ones singing and counting down together with me! 🎶😍🎶 Talking to camera instead of face-to-face is different, so seeing their adorable reactions make the hours of prep and waking up early (by my standards) TOTALLY WORTH IT!

Check out my last post to see snippets of my very cute audience 😘
