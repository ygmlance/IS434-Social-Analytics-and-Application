@chengdusg has launched their gorgeous “Chengdu Bowl”, which is like the popular Poke Bowl, but with a Chinese twist!

Islandwide delivery is available, order through the form on @chengdusg page. Minimum order of $20 applies.

The bowl comes in three sizes: Small ($10.60), Regular ($12.80) and Large $14.90.

My favourite was the Chicken with Chilli Mala Bowl 成都辣子鸡. The chicken was feisty-savoury and with good bite. It went really well with the moist and fluffy rice, which had a texture similar to Japanese sticky rice.

The rest of the “Sichuan side dishes” were surprisingly good too! The chewy mala-flavoured enoki mushroom was my favourite. The scrambled eggs, potato strips and edamame were also really fresh and delicious.

Overall, everything came together perfectly to form a vibrant, hearty and satisfying bowl.

The restaurant has recently launched their Chengdu Bowl Referral Programme as well.
