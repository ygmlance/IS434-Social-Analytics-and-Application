When life gives you lemons, roll them away with your nose and put a smile on your face! 🍋😊

Happy to be home with my fam after going to the emergency vet last night for IV drip and also my usual vet, The Joyous Vet since this morning as I have not been eating and drinking (I didn’t like it at all when they placed me in a metallic cage with a nearby doggie who kept yelping like what I usually do, my fam said bye to me and the vet/nurse poked painful needles to find out what’s wrong with me and inserted this weird tube ☹️). Now, I got a “wristband” and scarf” around my neck. I think the hoomans wanna make sure I get enuff strength so that I can “ruff” happily again and get well soon. .
Good thing is I found the strength to bark and vocalise again.... I was woooffffing non-stop at the clinic till I got my fam worried.... I can sleep alongside my owner hooman who seems to have stolen my bed 🐶 🛌 so that he can  watch over me all night. Home sweet home 🏡😊.
.
Grateful for all the love 💕 and concern from my fam (immediate and extended), friends, @petopia.singapore and the vet too. I am a truly lucky and blessed doggie 🐶🤗 Fighting!

Update as of 28 May morning: I even found the energy to drink water on my own... ahhhh water tastes soooo goood and refreshing!! 💦👍🏻 all the more reason to smile! 😁
