The aphorism. The fragment - all of these are notebook thinking ; are produced by the idea of keeping a notebook. One could trace history of thought / art in relation to the forms of transcription: letter manuscript notebook. Decline of the letter, the rise of the notebook! One doesn’t write to others any more; one writes to oneself. Why ? Parsimony ? Don’t squander one’s pretty phrases, one’s wisdom on someone else - a distant recipient why may not have the courtesy to save the letter.
Save it for yourself! - Susan Sontag
