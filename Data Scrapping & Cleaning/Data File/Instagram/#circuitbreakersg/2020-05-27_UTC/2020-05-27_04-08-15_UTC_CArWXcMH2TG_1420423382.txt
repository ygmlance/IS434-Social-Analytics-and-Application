Today is a double joy kind of day!! Firstly, I'm completely ecstatic that @orchardhealthclinic is finally open after 6 weeks. Those of you who's been following, knows how I've been experiencing lower backache, so I've really been looking forward to today the day CB started!

And then after i stepped in, i literally screamed when i saw @chenhanwei1969 there for his session as well! Well, story was, he got there 10mins before i did, so the clinic already told him I'll also be there. But he still 假假 call me to chat and tell me he's at home blah blah blah and what he's been up to. So obviously 1 min after i hang up and i see him sitting right there, i got a shock and screamed!! What a pleasant surprise it was!! I missed him!! Ahh, the simplest things we took for granted. :)
