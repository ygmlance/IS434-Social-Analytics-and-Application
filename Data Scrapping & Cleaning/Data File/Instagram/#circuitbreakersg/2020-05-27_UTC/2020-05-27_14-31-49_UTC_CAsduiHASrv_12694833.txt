BUTTERFLIES FLEW WHERE FLOWERS BLOOMED

Went out to get some groceries and noticed lots of butterflies attracted to the flowers along roadside grass patches.  I guess we donâ€™t see them in the past that often because grass were regularly trimmed. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
This pandemic halt that is changing the world has also allowed us to catch the lovely sight of nature! â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
