THE BRANCHES INSIDE YOU ⠀
The more I study anatomy the more I am in awe of the intricacies and parallels that can be drawn between the internal and the external. I like to think of this as Sacred Anatomy, a reaffirmation that we, humans, are truly microcosms, of the macrocosm that is our world, our planet, our universe. ⠀
Like the trees around us that branch far and wide, ⠀
you have a tree inside you as well.
