Baking is one out of the many HBL activities that we did together during this Covid-19 circuit breaker period.⠀ ⠀
In today’s episode, Alyssa is going to share with you her baking experience which she learned from My First Skool’s YouTube channel – Baking a Banana Cake!⠀ ⠀
Alyssa loves banana and this recipe came in just in time to satisfy her cravings and our dessert for this evening! With some help and guidance, Alyssa managed to recognise and pick out the essential ingredients for baking. That’s not all! She also learned about simple measurements in kilograms and litres, changes in heat and the effect of adding baking powder! We are glad that she enjoyed the activity, especially when her final product turns out yummy!⠀ ⠀
We all know that My First Skool prides itself in providing healthy and nutritious recipes for children and we are really thankful for the collection of recipes available on their YouTube channel (https://bit.ly/2TpPsNa) so that we will not have to worry about what to cook next all the time!⠀ ⠀
