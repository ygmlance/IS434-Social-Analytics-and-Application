~ Creamy Leek Pappardelle ~ We have some leftover leeks from making broth. So we tried something new today. The younger Simlet is usually the picky monster so I topped up with an onsen egg so that it is closer to carbonara. Instead of bacon, I airfried pork loin shabu shabu strip till crispy and mix them into the pasta. For our version, I added my favourite black lava salt to enhance the taste and look. Both of them ate the pasta without problem. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecooking #healthykidsfood #instafood #pasta #leek #pappardelle  #italianfood #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
