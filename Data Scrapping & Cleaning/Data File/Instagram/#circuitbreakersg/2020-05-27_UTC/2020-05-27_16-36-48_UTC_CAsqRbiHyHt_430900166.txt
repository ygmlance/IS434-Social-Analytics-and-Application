Late night reminder that some things take time to “happen”. The ideas may be there, the plans may have already been laid a long time ago ... but we are taking longer than expected to reach our goals. There’s a pandemic out there so it’s ok to be not ok. It’s ok to not have all the answers figured out. Hey... we don’t even know what the questions are yet?! But still, we’re moving forward - as a team. ❤️There may be some detours... but we’re growing & learning along the way. Sometimes it’s as important to realise this is NOT where we want to be, make a U-turn and PIVOT elsewhere. Will that be the right place? I don’t know. But I do know that we’re taking things one step at a time & we’re sticking it out together. And that’s good enough for us, for now. 💫💫
