Hitting the mat with my best motivational partner today @sherilynsensarus .
Joined @ytptofficial for their session! Thanks @stephytjq @jordinntay .
Part 1 (AMRAP, 2min/3min/5min)
- 7x Side to side squat
- 7x Side V-ups
.
Part 2 (EMOTM 7mins)
- 7-10x Burpees
- 7-10x Stargazers
.
If you can't do 10x, do 8x. If you can't do 8x, do 6x, if you can't do 6x, do 4x. It doesn't matter how many you do as long as you're doing it properly.
