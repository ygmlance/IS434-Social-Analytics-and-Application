Mango Fro Yo Sorbet

I have shared this with you a long time ago.
3 ingredient recipe!

Hung curd - 1cup
Mango puree - 1cup
Sugar 3-4 tbsp,  depending on how sweet the mangoes are.
Mix with a hand blender to get some air in there, pour in to dish, set as a block or in moulds as lollies. Freeze. Serve. 
I call it yoghurt sorbet as it has a slightly icy texture.
The taste depends entirely on the type of mango u use.
