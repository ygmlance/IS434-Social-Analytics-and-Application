[Homecooked] Cir Breaker Day 51 Lunch.

I saw Dr Leslie Tay's post on a quick and easy yaki udon recipe yesterday, and since I have all 3 essential ingredients at home, I made it for lunch.

It's pretty yummy, though I would suggest reducing the dark soy sauce to just half a tbsp  as the teriyaki chicken cubes are already quite sweet. The chicken is a lot as well, and you can just double the udon and vegetables with the same amount of chicken for 2 or 3 pax.

Below is my slightly modified recipe.
---
Ingredients
---
1 pack of udon
1 pack of CP glazed teriyaki chicken (you can also use the CP black pepper chicken)
Half a sliced red onion
4 big leaves of cabbage, chopped in big pieces 
Half a tbps dark soy sauce
1 tsp light soy sauce 
1 tbsp vegetable oil
Bonito flakes for topping
Dash of Japanese chilli powder or shichimi
---
Steps
---
1. Wash and separate udon in a large microwave safe bowl or claypot
2. Add dark soy, light soy and oil to udon. Mix well.
3. Layer onion and cabbage on top.
4. Add chicken and any remaining sauce in the packet. 
5. Cover with lid and microwave on high for 8mins.
6. Remove from microwave and mix well. Top with bonito flakes and shichimi. Enjoy while hot!

You can use any other ready ingredients like smoked duck breast, fishcake, cooked seafood and mushrooms. Do give this recipe a try. It's healthier than eating instant noodles alone or deep fried fast food. The whole process from prepping to cooking takes less than 15mins.
Thank you Dr Tay @ieatishootipost for sharing this recipe
