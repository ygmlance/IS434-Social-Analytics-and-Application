[Homecooked] Cir Breaker Day 51 Dinner.

2 dishes tonight and none requires me to use the wok. Phew. --- Oden soup with added dumplings, shanghai greens and enoki mushrooms
--- Steamed egg with minced pork and coriander 
Just realised that we have been eating all meals at our dining table for 51 days already. Does that make you feel accomplished or depressed? I'm a mix of both. Hahaha.
