Psst! My room smells so nice after spraying @febreze on my header board & mattress 💗 I also used it to clean the many soft toys Sophie has. It’s hard to clean fabric by yourself & I’m glad that @febreze solves my problem! It removes odours & *eliminate* 99% germs :) Feeling clean, fresh & germ free after spraying! 💫⁣
Chose your scent - Blossom & Breeze or Anti-Bacterial? :) Both smells so nice!! ⁣
