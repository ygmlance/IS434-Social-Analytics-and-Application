💖Plan & execute💖
Gloomy morning but still up early and dusted my legs workout. 💪🏻
Having a plan keeps you on track especially during this #circuitbreakersg period. Plan not just your to-do list but also the exact time for each activities. The time you wake up, the time you work out, the time you have your meals and the time you sleep. Having a good rest is equally important as working out. I have a fixed weekly workout routine that changes once a month. I also have the habit of planning my meals weekly. So I have meals to look forward to post workout especially on legs day. Like my huge bagelwich for today’s lunch! Heehee. ☺️ Glutes was constantly on fire but I kept telling myself faster finish than I get to enjoy my bagel later. 😜
