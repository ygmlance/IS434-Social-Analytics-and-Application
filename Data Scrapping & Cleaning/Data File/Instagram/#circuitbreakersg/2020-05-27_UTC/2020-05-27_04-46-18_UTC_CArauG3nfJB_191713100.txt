🕘Breakfast: Homemade Bao Zi

Fresh hot homemade bao/pau for the morning tummy. Made two types of fillings, the mushroom with pork and char siew.

Bao, just like dumplings, you can fill them with whatever you like.

My virgin attempt making them, although as not perfect as i hope, but these are definitely light and delicious. 
Shall not lose hope and gonna try again soon.
