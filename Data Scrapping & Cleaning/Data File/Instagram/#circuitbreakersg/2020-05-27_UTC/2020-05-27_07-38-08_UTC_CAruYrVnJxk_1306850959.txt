🍃To be interested in the changing seasons is a happier stage of mind than to be hopelessly in love with spring. 🍃 It’s nice to have something that we really like but life is such that, it’s impossible to only accept the things we like. Because life is not perfect. Life is made up of nice stuff and also the less favourable stuff. It’s only when you embrace the less unfavorable stuff, then you will be able to treasure the stuff you like. And, I think you will be happier. 🙂 This morning, I still have 1 curry puff left from yesterday. So I decided to recreate it into a rock in underwater world for Ariel! I often see artists drawing Disney princesses effortlessly but omg, I find it so challenging to draw Ariel, especially her eyes!!! They were big and I decided to just let my Ariel continue with big eyes because I couldn’t make them smaller. 😅 I’m glad that Ariel turns out to be quite sweet-looking in the end! 🥰I initially intended to draw Flounder too but was too hungry to continue with Flounder. 😁 It’s ok. Ariel is not lonely as she is accompanied by many cheddar fishes and 2 eclairs (recreated as sea rocks). 😁 Maybe, I shall try other Disney princesses next time! Have a magical mid-week! 🤩🤩🤩
