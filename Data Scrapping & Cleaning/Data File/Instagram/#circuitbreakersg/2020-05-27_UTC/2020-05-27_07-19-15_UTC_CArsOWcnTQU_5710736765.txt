It’s a wednesday so lets #tb to a full pink ootd 🌸 Genetically we all hold fats differently and I don’t normally see any abs peaking through until about 4-6weeks out. And losing fat around the waist does not mean doing 500 crunches a day because there’s NO SUCH THING as spot reduction. You have to start losing overall fat before your body decides “hey its finally your turn(wherever ur stubborn fat is) to go.” Learn to stay consistent and trust the process!!💪🏼💯
