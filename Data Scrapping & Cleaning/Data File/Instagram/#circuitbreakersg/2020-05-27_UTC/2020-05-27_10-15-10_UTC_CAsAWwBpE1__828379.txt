During this 2 months of staying home, Royce and Ryo had done alot of HBL and art & craft activities while away from school. This is another activity that we have done together and is also one of my favourite art & craft pieces that they have did üòç. The artpiece is now hanging at my main door. Really thankful to the teachers for sharing these simple, creative and easy to follow HBL activities for us to engage the kids üß°

Last Friday, Royce had a zoom session with his teachers, classmates and other parents to help us prepare for back-to-school! Royce is all prepared and eager to head back to school to catch up with his friends.
