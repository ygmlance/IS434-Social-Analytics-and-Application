🕞 Italian Ciabatta, The Slipper Bread

Yes, I made this Italian slipper bread again! 
However this time round, it’s a 48HR FERMENTATION dough with 80% Hydration. And the result of this bread is heavenly delicious! 
It’s so so light, soft and airy. Totally worth the wait.

Looking at these big airy holes, put a smile on my face
