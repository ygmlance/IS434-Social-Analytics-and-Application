#circuitbreakersg day 51

Received some love in a box today. ðŸ’œ

An old friend of mine sent this lovely blueberry tart from @enjoue.bakery to me. The blueberry tart was light and amazingly fruity and arrived just in time for my late lunch today. ðŸ˜‹ .

Although we have to socially distance ourselves, Iâ€™m grateful for the love that I have received both virtually and via food of love during this time. ðŸ§¡ #gratitudediary
