“Art is as natural as sunshine and as vital as nourishment.” -Maryann F. Kohl.

I chanced upon this online art jamming session on @artfullyyourssg. It reminded me of our canaries and how much the kids love birds. They’re always asking to go to the Bird Park but I diverted their attention because it’s so far! Anyways I figured this may be something they would like.  For me, I like that this art tutorial is pre-recorded and we can access it anytime we want. Before they start to paint, we watched a video to learn about parrots, read a story book about parrots and if they didn’t feel like painting, there are also coloring PDFs.

So proud of both of them for finishing it with little fuss. Drawing by me, outlining and painting by them. The recommended time was 2 hours and we spent 5 hours on it with lots of snack breaks in between of course. We split into 2 afternoons, no rush since we’re not going anywhere. That’s 5 hours away from screen time with no fighting or crying to deal with. Highly recommended if you’re looking for a way to spend a lovely afternoon with your lil Picassos😎😎 #circuitbreakersg #notsponsored
