My wife and I just had a @fook.kin awesome lunch! I dont normally post about roasted meat but this is easily the best tasting one around. Despite taking away, the crackling roast pork is super crispy and juicy. The caramelised char siew is a must-order as well. The char siew is premium and the fattiness is just right. We also ordered their in-house BBT and what better way to wash all the glorious roast meat down with BBT! A pity we could not eat the meal at their cool restaurant along Killiney Rd.
