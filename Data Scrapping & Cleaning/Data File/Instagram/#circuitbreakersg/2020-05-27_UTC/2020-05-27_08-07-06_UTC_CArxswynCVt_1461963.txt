Day 51 of CB - Made Bak Chor Mee for lunch in 2 hours. Attempted to make fish balls but the blender died on me so could only make fish meat balls. Added the her keow from @9sseafood as well. Mushroom magic sauce to round up the dish. Soup was da bomb so the kids cleaned out their bowls.  #homecooked #umamilicious #circuitbreakersg
