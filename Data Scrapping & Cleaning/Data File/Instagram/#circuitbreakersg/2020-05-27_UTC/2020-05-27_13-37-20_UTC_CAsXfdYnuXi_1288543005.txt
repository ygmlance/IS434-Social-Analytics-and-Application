My neighbour jio me to order Lian He Ben Ji (联合本记煲饭) claypot chicken rice.
.
This claypot rice is really delicious 😋. Now I understand why the stall has a long waiting time of up to an hour.
.
We ordered the portion that was meant for 2 - 3 pax. The portion was generous with chunky pieces of chicken, lup cheong and salted fish (is real big pieces). The salted fish just goes so well with the dark sauce rice. Not forgetting about the chilli sauce too. It is damn shiok.
