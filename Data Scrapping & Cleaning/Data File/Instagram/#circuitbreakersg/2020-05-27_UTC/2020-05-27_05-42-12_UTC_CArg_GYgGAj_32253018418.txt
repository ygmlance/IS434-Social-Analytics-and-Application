The first music video of an original song by Whiskey Bones. The video was made in association with Spartans Boxing Club to inspire working out at home during the Circuit Breaker. All scenes were filmed at home.

Spartans Boxing Club's strongest pillar is it's community, where people from all walks of life can come together to keep fit. During this pandemic, they embraced the community by providing them with daily online Live Workouts, Spartans Community TV (featuring celebrity guests) and their weekly Spartans Community Game Nights! So check them out @boxingspartans_jc, be a part of their community and be a Spartan!
