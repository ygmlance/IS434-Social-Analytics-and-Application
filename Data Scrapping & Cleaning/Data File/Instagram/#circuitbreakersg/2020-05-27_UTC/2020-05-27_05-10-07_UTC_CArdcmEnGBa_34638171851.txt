[Mdm Ling Bakery]
.
Selling an assortments of buns and premium biscuits, @mdmlingbakery is a to-go online bakery for me! They also offer free delivery for orders above $45 only!
.
Salted Egg Yolk Bun ($9.90): All of the oozing goodness that i love! It tastes as good or even better than some dimsum places! Love how generous the salted egg was; it was overflowing when i opened it 😂 .
Red Bean Bau ($7.90): A huge bun that is so soft and filling. I love how the red bean paste was not overtly sweet! .
Pink Himalayan Salt Chocolate Almond Cookies ($16.30): Chocolate cookies with himalayan salt for a savoury boost. Love the mild salty aftertaste and the cookies are more chocolaty and salty with a nutty taste than sweet. This is a yes from me!
.
New Zealand’s Premium Butter Cookies ($16.30): Creamy and buttery cookies that melts in your mouth. It’s not overly sweet and i can eat more than 7 in a go 😂 That’s how good it is! This is also a must buy from them! .
