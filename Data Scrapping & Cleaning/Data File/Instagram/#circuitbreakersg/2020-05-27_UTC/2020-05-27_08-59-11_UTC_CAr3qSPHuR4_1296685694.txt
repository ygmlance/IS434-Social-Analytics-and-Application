20th wedding anniversary today on 527 (我爱妻), make do with simple celebration at home since it’s circuit breaker period. Initial plan to revisit our honeymoon destinations in London and Paris had to be scrapped.
. 
Made a heart-shaped Mango non-bake cheesecake as I’ve got ingredients like Lotus Biscoff, Philadelphia cream cheese, Greek yogurt and mangoes at home. I made extra batter to make into cheesecake bottles too! 😋(swipe 🔙☝️to watch a short video on how it’s being made).
.

It’s the mango season now and mangoes are plentiful and cheap, so If you’d like to try this popular non-bake cheesecake in my blog, google “Baking Taitai Healthy No -bake Cheesecake” for step-by-step pictorial recipe. .
