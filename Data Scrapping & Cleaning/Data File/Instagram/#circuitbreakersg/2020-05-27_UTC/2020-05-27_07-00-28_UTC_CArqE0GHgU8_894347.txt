Day 51 : Throw back today in 2007 ,its my wedding day 🥰. I always wanted to share this but couldn’t find a chance.  This is one of the reason for me to become a makeup artist. You can see me in 4 different photos. I love No1❤️❤️, and No2 is totally disaster😩😩 and it’s happened on the most important actual day. And look at No4 remind me on a Bling Bling singer. 
I have 3 different makeup experience with makeup artists from different places. And only 1 mua make me feel pretty. 
This is why I always ask my bride to do trial before the wedding. Bride need to make sure the look is what you want and not compromised with something you not really ok with. 
I am glad that at least I love one of the makeup I’ve done. But I really regret for not doing the trial for my actual day look. Thank goodness 🙏🏻 that I found Bobby from The Makeuproom and this is why I end up learning makeup from them too.✌🏻 Guess which makeup is done by Bobby? 😁
