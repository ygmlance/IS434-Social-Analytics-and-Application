Laksa

I think one thing that I missed from hawker center during circuit breaker period will be laksa. So decided to make it my own by using laksa pack from @primataste. I must say this is impressive!

Ingredients: 
Noodles (I got this from wet market stall and realize it is perfect for laksa. The texture is in between glass noodles and thick bee hoon)
Chicken breast (season with salt, sesame oil, light soya sauce for 30 minutes. Then steam for 10-15 minutes depending on the size. Then shred it)
Boiled egg
Bean sprouts
Dried bean curd or Yong tau fu

❶ boil 2 pots of water. 1 for laksa broth and the other one for noodles and bean sprouts
❷ cook laksa broth according to instructions from the pack
❸ at the same time, boil noodles. Then bean sprout after noodles are done
❹ when the laksa broth is boiling, add dried bean curd or yong taufu and cook until boiling
❺ assemble noodles, bean sprouts, chicken breast and egg in a bowl and ready to serve by adding in laksa broth ⚠️please don’t forget the sambal pack that come together. It is a must for laksa.
