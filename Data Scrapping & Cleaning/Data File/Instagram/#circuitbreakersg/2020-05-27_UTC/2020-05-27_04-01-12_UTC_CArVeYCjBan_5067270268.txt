SPACIOUSNESS SIDEWAYS⠀
⠀
Of the 6 degrees of freedom, lateral flexion (side stretches) are argueably the least common way we move. ⠀
It's equally important however to mobilise the spine this way as it creates spaciousness and awareness in the ribs and muscles along the side body (e.g. obliques), affecting how you breath and how you feel. ⠀
⠀⠀
Here's a bite-sized lateral flexion exercise you can adapt for your home practice: ⠀⠀
1. Come into cow face legs (shown) or firelog pose, right leg above the left. Ground down through both sides of your pelvis, inhaling lengthen your spine⠀
2. Keeping the length, rainbow the spine over to the right, crawling your right fingers away from your right hip, option to keep the spaciousness in your right side ribs while you let the right elbow touch the ground or a block.  Left arm reaches overhead. ⠀
3. Inhale slowly returning to center. Exhale let your spine drape over your legs and knees in a forward fold (flexion). 4. 2 options here -#1 turn to your left, place the palms on the ground, keeping the feet as they are, lift and walk a full circle and sit back to the same position on the opposite side (This is my favourite!) OR #2 simply uncross and cross the legs so the left comes on top. Repeat 1-3 for the left side. ⠀
Afterwards it can be nice to lie on your back (supine) and come into happy baby (grounding), and/or bridge pose (energetic) depending on what you'd like more of.
