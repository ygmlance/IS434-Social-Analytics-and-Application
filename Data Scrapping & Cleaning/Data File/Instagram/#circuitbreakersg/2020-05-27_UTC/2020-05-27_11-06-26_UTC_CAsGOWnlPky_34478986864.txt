We both agreed on #japanesefood tonight, but something a bit more meat-heavy/western. So we ordered from the nearby #hamburgsteakkeisuke, another one of our favorites. Their delicious bento boxes were beautifully packaged, and came with a tomato and corn salad 🥗 and Miso soup (not shown). I had the plain hamburg and Hubs had the cheesy one...perfect if you would like an extra burst of flavor!

No eggs unfortunately 😔  I soooo miss the #eggbuffet 🍳 at the restaurant, that was actually my favorite part 😭 One day we'll make it back there... 🤞

For now, order via @deliveroo_sg or even better, call or whatsapp (number on their website), where you can mix and match from other #keisuke restaurants if you are within a 3km radius! 🍱🍜🥟🍣 #sgfoodies #sgeats #singaporerestaurants #savefnbsg #circuitbreakersg #onemealaday #sgdelivery
