Accepting Rolling Submissions!
.
.
.
 PSA: we’ve decided to keep this call open and will continue to accept ongoing submissions, - ie. no deadline! We know stories, conversations, and relationships take time to ferment and unfold. While we’ll soon see the gradual relaxation of measures, we also see with increasing clarity that recovery and response is a slow process. We want to encourage and urge the keen observers amongst our midst to keep seeing, listening, and relating to what is emerging. .
