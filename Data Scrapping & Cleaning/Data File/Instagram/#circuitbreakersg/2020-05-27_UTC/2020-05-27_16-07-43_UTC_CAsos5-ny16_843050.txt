*Cranberry & Raisin Scones*

Got the scones done right on my 2nd try! I tried Jamie Oliver’s recipe this time and the scones turned out looking so rustic just the way I like it! It was also crumbly with a crisp outside and fluffy inside. .

1 of the mistakes I knew I made previously was over mixing the dough. So after watching Jamie’s YouTube vid, I reminded myself to just smush the ingredients together roughly. Had to really refrain myself from making everything “neat” and was a wee bit worried that the ingredients weren’t well-incorporated. 😂 .

This just makes me feel that baking is like taking a leap of faith. You can follow all the instructions and still fail; you think you got some parts messed up but in the end when you just chill and go with the flow, you get the most unexpected results. When I overwork my dough coz I wanna make sure I incorporate everything, it’s like I’m trying too hard “my way”; when I choose to trust that I’ve done enough to the dough and choose to stop & rest the dough, that’s when the magic happens... when I rest, that’s when God can come in to work on the dough and make it rise and ready for the oven. That when I choose to rest and let God do the work for me, even though I may walk through the fire, I will still turn out glorious, all for the better. Just like these beautiful golden scones. 🤩🤩🤩 .

All my life, I’ve never thought I could bake, even though I always owned an oven, I only used it to bake meals. I was worried about the preciseness of baking, thinking that it would be too much for me. The thought that 1 wrong move would ruin the whole project just put me off baking all these years. I don’t know what was it that really moved me to pick up baking this #circuitbreakersg.. but I’m so glad I took a leap of faith and conquered this challenge.
