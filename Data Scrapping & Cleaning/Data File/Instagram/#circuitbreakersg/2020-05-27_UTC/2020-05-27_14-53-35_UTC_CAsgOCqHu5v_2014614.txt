Haven’t been cooking these days so here’s a #latergram of the 𝐏𝐚𝐧-𝐟𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐘𝐚𝐦 𝐂𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐄𝐠𝐠 I cooked over the long weekend. Served the crispy yam cake with #老乾媽 chilli at the side. Oh, not forgetting my daily #caffeinefix - a cuppa #homebrewed @yakunkayatoastsg coffee. ⁣⁣

PS: Nope, I didn’t make the yam cake from scratch~ Bought the @oldsengchoong yam cake from @misstamchiak’s FB Live. Actually, I just wanna buy the pre-packed Claypot Chicken but ended up buying the yam cake, mushroom soup and truffle butter as well. #noragrats ⁣#thisiswhyiambroke⁣
