Dinner this evening, was a dish of stir-fried Nai Bai, or Milk Cabbage, a reheated, defrosted Pork Rib with Radish Kimchi Stew from 5th May, and the Cabbage Rice cooked this morning. Totally sweat inducing on a warm evening, but tasty and totally satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #porkribkimchistew #stirfriednaibai #cabbagerice #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #reheatedleftovers #nowastemeal #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
