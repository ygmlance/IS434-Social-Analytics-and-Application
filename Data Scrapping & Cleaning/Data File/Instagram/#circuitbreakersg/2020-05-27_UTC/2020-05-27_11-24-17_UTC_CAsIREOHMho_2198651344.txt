Our family had a creamy fusion Baked MAGGI and Cheese Salmon Noodles for lunch today! 🥘
.
I tossed my @maggi_sg Chicken Noodles in a homemade cream sauce (made of fresh milk, butter, parmesan cheese and some flour) and then topped it up with some oven-baked salmon, cherry tomatoes and dried herb flakes. Overall, it was a nutritious one-dish meal. Swipe ⬅️ for more pics.

Have fun and be creative at home with your MAGGI noodles during this Circuit Breaker period. 😉
