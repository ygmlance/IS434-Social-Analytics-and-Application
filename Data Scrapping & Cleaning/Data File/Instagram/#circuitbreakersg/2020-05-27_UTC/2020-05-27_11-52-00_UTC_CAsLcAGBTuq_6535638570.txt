Had such a feast for lunch thanks to @being1ton. The wanton mee business which has been around for over 30 years doesn't just sell the heaviest noodles ever; they also serve up a la carte sides such as the fatty, succulent and thick-cut Charsiu ($4/5/6) that's different from their regular wanton mee charsiu; delicious and crisp Chicken Katsu ($5/6/7); Fried Shrimp Dumplings ($4/5/6) that possess an ASMR-worthy crispiness filled with meat and shrimp; moreish and flavourful Wanton/Dumpling Soup with pork lard that's quite frankly worth raving about (?!); and Wantons/Dumplings with Sauce ($4/5/6) for something a little less sinful. 😋⁣

Of course, the star dish will always be the signature black sauce Wanton Noodle ($4/5/6). Using springy noodles that absorb the flavour of the sauce, the dish also comes with fried wantons and charsiu that's thinner than its a la carte counterpart, but still retains a tender and fatty texture with a juicy, mildly sweet flavour. I also love how it is well wrapped before being put into a takeaway box to prevent spillage or messes from happening while in transit.⁣

Overall, the food here is really, really satiafying, and I'd dare say it's surely improved from the first time I tried their dishes. Definitely would recommend ordering from them; islandwide delivery is available with NO minimum spending required — delivery charges depend on distance so do drop @being1ton a message to inquire about that and place your order as well!⁣
