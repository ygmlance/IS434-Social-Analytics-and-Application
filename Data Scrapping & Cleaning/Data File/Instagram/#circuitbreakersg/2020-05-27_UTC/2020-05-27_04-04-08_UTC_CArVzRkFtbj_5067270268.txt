MIMOSA PUDICA (SOMATIC)⠀
Given that most of us spend a lot of time sitting in a chair, the deep squat, is a highly beneficial pose. This practice takes inspiration from opening and closing of the mimosa pudica plant: the rounding (flexion) and arching (extension) of our spines mirrors the inward spiral of your lungs and nestling in of your heart, and the outward spiral of the lungs and the moving forward of your heart. ⠀
⠀
TIPS: ⠀
1. Being in a deep squat, knees in the same line as your ankles, avoiding strain in your knees - keep your heels lifted if they don't easily ground. Exhale here. ⠀
2. Let your chest brighten and blossom open, arms spreading our, inhaling. At the end of the inhale, begin to round the spine and close like a mimosa plant, closing back into deep squat, exhaling⠀
3. Repeat step 2 slowly, picking up the pace if you'd like, even straightening your legs gradually building strength with momentum on inhale. Feel steady through your roots before rising and eventually coming up to standing.
