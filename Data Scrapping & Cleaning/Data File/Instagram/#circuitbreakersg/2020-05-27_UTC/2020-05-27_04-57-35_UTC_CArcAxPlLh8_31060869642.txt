Basque Burnt Cheesecake, whole 8” ($62.00)
I’m a number #1 fanatic of all burnt cheesecake so trust me when I say this has officially taken over my personal favourite for best burnt cheesecake in Singapore 🤤 Straight up just from carrying this cheesecake, I knew this was a DENSE cheesecake given its weight 🤪 And boy was I right... Bakery Brera’s cheesecake is on the richer and thicker side compared to other places such as The Kin’s which opts for a lighter and softer style of burnt cheesecake. The aroma of the cream cheese hits you instantly and the first cut into the cake made me salivate once it’s smooth interior was revealed🥺 It hits the absolute right spot with the appropriate amount of richness of the cheese and the texture was so satisfying as it is meltingly soft and if you keep it in the fridge for a while, it almost resembles ice cream. Needless to say, I will be back an ungodly number of times to get my hands on their burnt cheesecake again 🤪

I also tried their rustic country sourdough bread which was HUGE and really good too! Their other pastries weren’t bad too but their basque burnt cheesecake is the real star of the show🤩 Will be back to try their Matcha and Hojicha-flavoured burnt cheesecakes!
