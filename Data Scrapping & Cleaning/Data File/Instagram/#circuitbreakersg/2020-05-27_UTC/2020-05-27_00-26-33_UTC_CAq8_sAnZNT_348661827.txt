My god, I hope you find beauty when it’s sweltering hot and humid. And imagine the wind blowing through your hair when the air is so still and muggy. I hope you find happiness in early morning sunrises and the smell of your favourite spots when all you want to do is curl up in bed under the covers. I hope you find freedom between your rib cage when you’re breathing in and out to stretch that tired body of yours. I hope you find love between fits of laughter and tears you share with loved ones. I hope you’re singing at the top of lungs whenever you hear your favourite cheesy tunes in the car without a care in the world what the other person next to you thinks. I hope you let your heart melt when you’re completely smitten by that boy or girl instead of being guarded. I hope you fall in love with the messiness of life and the fuck ups. I hope you’ll be kinder to yourself when you couldn’t in the past. And I hope your cup will always be half full.
