Don't miss out on your little one's toys when you're cleaning! We suggest to soak softer plastic and rubber toys without batteries in warm water, wipe down with a cloth and lastly disinfect with our trusty surface sanitiser. ⁠
⁠
The process is really simple for older children to join in to clean their own toys! Try that out and let us know how it went in the comments 😊⁠
