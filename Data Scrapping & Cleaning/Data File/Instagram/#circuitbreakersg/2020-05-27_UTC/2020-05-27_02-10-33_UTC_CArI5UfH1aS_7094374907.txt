A cheeky nod to the iconic McSpicy, this mala chicken burger from @fatboyssg comes close to what I would consider, a winner winner chicken dinner.

The chicken cutlet, in all its crispy glory, is dredged in a flour mix comprising a combination of aromatic spices and seasonings and given a generous saucing of their house-made mala aioli. Garlicky and creamy with a slight tang and nuanced flavour of Szechuan spice, the aioli was what made it for me.

Where do you guys go to satisfy your burger cravings? Let me know!
