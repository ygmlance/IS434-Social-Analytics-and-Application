Spotted this video of @h4usalon in Facebook, & I'm certainly impressed! What do you think of this added feature for social distancing?

Here’s what they said in their post, "终于把防疫工作做好了，为了顾客和工作人员的安全，口罩，一米距离和消毒之外，现在再加一层防护膜就更放心了。"

Kudos to them for putting their customers' well-being in first place. Well, I'm sure we'll feel more at ease visiting their #H4Usalon come June 2 when more businesses will be allowed to resume operations.
