Breakfast this morning, was Cabbage Rice, because i didnâ€™t feel like washing up so many things! This contained cabbage, leek, carrot, cubes of lard, fishcake and sliced lap cheong, or Chinese Sausage, and was seasoned with both superior light and dark soya sauces. Simple to cook and clean, and very satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #cabbagerice #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbreakfast #onepotmeal #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
