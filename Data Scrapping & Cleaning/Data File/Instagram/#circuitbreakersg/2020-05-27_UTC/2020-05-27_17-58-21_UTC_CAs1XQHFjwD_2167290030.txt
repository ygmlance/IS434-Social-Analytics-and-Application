DAY 51, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
(Countdown ... 5 days to go!)
STUFFED PORTOBELLO

It was a mushroom affair last night üòç 
Creamy mushroom soup with crispy breadsticks and stuffed portobello mushrooms. 
I saut√©d some finely chopped onion and garlic, in some butter. Mixed it with some chopped luncheon meat and ricotta cheese. Stuffed the mushrooms, put some grated cheddar cheese on top, baked in the oven at 280¬∞C for 15-20min..
