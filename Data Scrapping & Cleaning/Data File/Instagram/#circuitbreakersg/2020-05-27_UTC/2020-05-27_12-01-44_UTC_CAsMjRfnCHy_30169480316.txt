#whatsfordinner Proudly present my putien 反沙芋 (sugared Taro). My 1st attempt on this as a self challenge 🤣 It was very well-received by my only Guinea pig at home cos it's the 1st sweet dish I could possibly cook thus far. It requires a freaking 4 tbsp of sugar (I have reduced it to 3 tbsp 😌)! Definitely not my usual cooking style as I don't add sugar to my cooking. But glad that it turned out well!
Other dishes include steamed threadfin fish 🐠, stir fry choy sim 🥬with garlic and lotus root with with peanut and pork rib soup 🍲
