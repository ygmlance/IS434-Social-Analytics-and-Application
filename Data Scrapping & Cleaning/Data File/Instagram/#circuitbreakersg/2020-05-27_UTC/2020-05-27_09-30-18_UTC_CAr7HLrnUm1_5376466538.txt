I look forward to girlsâ€™ night with besties where I can chat with them about everything over a great meal. Ever since being a mum, girlsâ€™ nights are so rare and precious that I will specially dress up and put on a little makeup to make myself feel great. But I have to admit that the only makeup that I know how to put on is a lipstick no matter how many makeup tutorial Iâ€™ve attempted to watch online. Now Iâ€™m challenging myself with this lipstick challenge by putting a vertical strip at the middle and spreading to a full coat by just moving my lips ðŸ’‹

Stay safe my friends (sending lots of kisses) and see you soon at our next girlsâ€™ night. .
