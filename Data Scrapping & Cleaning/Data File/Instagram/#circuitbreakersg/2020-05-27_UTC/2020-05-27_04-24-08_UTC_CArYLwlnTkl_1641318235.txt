I think we've made ourselves enough toys to last this whole circuit breaker! 🎪🎡🎠⁣ ⁣
All thanks to Bray's #HBL activitiesssss from NTUC First Campus’ My First Skool! 🤩⁣

Latest addition this school holiday is this "Car-bot" game booth made out of an old toy box, complete with game coupons and play money! Bray helped assembled the obstacles and made the tracks in his "Car-bot", and carefully pasted directional signs which he learnt to read, after which we role-played carnival booth to buy game coupons with the play money. How comprehensive and encompassing is this home based learning activity! And the extended activities around this game booth is just endless! Even Bel wanted to play!⁣

We can't wait for school to reopen now and in the meantime, we are checking out other "Car-bots" made by his friends too on the My First Skool parent portal app. Not just the app where we picked up our home learning activity worksheets, his teachers continued to update us of the works completed by all other children too. Very much a continuation of how they have been updating us of things happening in the classroom too.⁣
