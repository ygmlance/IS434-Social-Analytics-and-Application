Do your kids love puzzles too?

Puzzles are highly beneficial to a child’s brain development, that’s what I believe.  There are many articles written to substantiate this and here are my consolidated thoughts:

1. Promotes shape recognition
2. Helps with hand-eye coordination
3. Teaches problem solving 
4. Enhances memory
5. Increases attention span
6. Build spatial awareness
7. Cultivates patience

And here’s what I feel is the most important factor in my opinion:

8. Develops perseverance

In this video, my soon-to-be 6yo is seen doing The Small T’s box 1 and it is extremely challenging. Even though it is age appropriate, I would suggest starting with the easier Box 2 as it

9. Builds a sense of achievement

After completing Box 2, he moved onto Box 1 with my guidance.  We have not completed Box 1 yet but I thought I’d share on how intriguing these puzzle sets are even for myself as an adult.

@the.smallt ‘s mind boggling puzzles for kids are not for the faint hearted.  It can most definitely help your child move one step closer to achieving all of the outcomes listed above.

Maybe someday, a Mensa membership?  Till then, keep calm and solve puzzles!
