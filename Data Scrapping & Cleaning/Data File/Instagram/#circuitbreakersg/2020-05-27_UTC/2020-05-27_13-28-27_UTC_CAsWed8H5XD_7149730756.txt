Founded in 2014 as a community farm, @comcropsg, one of our #ChangeMakersSG, is Singapore’s first and only rooftop greenhouse making use of advanced hydroponic techniques to farm their vegetables, which allows them to use 90% less water than traditional farming.

The result? Fresh and affordable produce that are free of harmful pesticides and herbicides delivered to our local supermarkets.

However, the current COVID-19 situation has caused a disruption in our country’s food supply chains, and ComCrop stands among those who are working hard to maintain food security within Singapore while at the same time fulfilling the government’s '30 by 30' goal: to cultivate enough food locally to meet 30% of the country’s nutritional needs by 2030.

Geneco has committed to do our part by subsidising ComCrop’s electricity bills for a year in support of their sustainability efforts.

We choose to Power Sustainability, alongside ComCrop.
