Movie nights and game nights are our favourite way to unwind and chill with the fam; definitely how we like to take a break from the #covidlife madness of juggling #homebasedlearning, work and family duties! .
We created our MOVIE NIGHT MUNCHIES menu inspired from our own foodie wish list! The perfect grub to dig into while you watch your family fave on #netflix , or squabble over scrabble and monopoly! 😝
.
.
Available in sets for 2,4 and 6 pax, with discounts for bulk orders. Orders open for the upcoming weekend! .
Swipe images to check our menu, customer feedback and details on how to order! ☺️
