Enjoying some chocolatey goodness with my homemade flourless chocolate fudge cake! 🍰
✨
First attempt with flourless bakes and I’m glad it turned out to be better than expected. Love the amazing fudgey texture which is just right without being cloying. Used 70% dark chocolate from @valrhona_asia and it’s so lusciously rich. What’s more, it’s actually quite healthy! Can be served warm or chilled - it’s more moist when warm and drier when chilled. I prefer mine chilled! What about you? 🍫

Swipe ⬅️ for more. Think this will go very well with some ice cream. I also dusted on a layer of Valrhona cocoa powder in the end for more chocolatey goodness! Now should I try a matcha version? 🍵
