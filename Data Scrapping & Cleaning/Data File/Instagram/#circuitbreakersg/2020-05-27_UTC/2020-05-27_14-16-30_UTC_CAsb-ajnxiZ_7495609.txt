{DIY Lava Lamp}
.
I think #charmerteo Kor Kor is over with kiddy activities & he is more into STEM experiments. When I told him that we were going to make our own cool lava lamp 🪔, he gave a face 😒 & said “boring~~”. Spent quite awhile to coax him into the activity & Mei Mei #louisateo was as excited as ever (except exercise). When he saw baking soda & food colourings on the table, he finally got it that it was going to be a SCIENCE EXPERIMENT 🧪. Both enjoyed so much that we spent an hr playing with the food bubbles... they said they wana do again tomorrow! Going to find another way to make those beautiful lava lamp without using so much oil (so expensive!).

Ingredients:
3 tsp of baking soda + fill the jar with oil to 3/4. In a separate cup, pour about 100ml of vinegar & add food colouring (one colour). Then using the dropper/syringe, drop bit by bit into the oil jar. Let the magic being...
.
Now... the 2 jars are in our bedrooms...
