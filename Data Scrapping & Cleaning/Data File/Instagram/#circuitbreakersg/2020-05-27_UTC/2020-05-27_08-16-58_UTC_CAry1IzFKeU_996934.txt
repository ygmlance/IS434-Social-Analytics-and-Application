#circuitbreakerday50 x Mandatory Leave Day 7 // Not quite a #metasingapore #donburi, but a tasty lunch nonetheless, after the first #campuspastor meeting I’ve managed to attend for a long while. .
Amazed by how much admin, tech, and logistical work is required to hold an event, and grateful for all the people whose gift it is to tease out the nitty-gritty detail of such practical matters. .
It’s important that such people are godly too, because this isn’t just about another seamless MICE experience; it’s about the faithful proclamation of the truth - so the method of proclamation must be compatible with the message.
.
Since it is about truth, then “...having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:1-2).
