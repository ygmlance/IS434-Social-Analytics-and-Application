Painting is Art ðŸ–¼ 
Painting can be a great podium for children to progress and discover their creativity, to develop hand muscle skills and decision-making skills. They need to plan ahead as they choose which color should be used for different parts of the painting.
Through the use of different colors, they can also express themselves without the use of words.
