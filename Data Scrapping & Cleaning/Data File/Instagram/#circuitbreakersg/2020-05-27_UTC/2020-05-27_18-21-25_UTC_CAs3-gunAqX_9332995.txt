🅱️🅰️🅾️ is very happy to be part of this fun project Livin’ COVIDa Loca (a corona-parody)! Below are words from lyricist/ director @ltcjon ! "Check out the full video at :

The circuit breaker is ending! Or maybe it’s just relaxing. A teeny bit. Ah well. Better than nothing.
Still, it’ll be awhile before we meet each other for movies/makan/parties/theatre/shopping.  But we wanted to reach out and congratulate all of us for two remarkably patient months of kicking corona-ass by staying home! And to cheer everybody on for what’s to come- we are amazingly strong together, and we will come through this as one. 
So a bunch of us performers got together and produced a little home-made parody music video as a tribute to our time together apart! Enjoy, and we hope it makes you dance a little bit. 
Please spread the love by sharing this with your friends stuck at home! [ disclaimer: while this parody is not connected with the other parallel parody (official new term: parallelody) of the same song that came out a couple weeks ago (featuring many talented friends of ours), it is wonderful to know that SG’s parody game is strong! ]" #day52 #circuitbreakersg #hanginthere #phase1coming #notscarednoimage #siaozabor #千面女郎 #dyingtoperform #theatrekakis #baoreallypatternzuayguaybadminton #staypositive #stayfunny #audreyluo
