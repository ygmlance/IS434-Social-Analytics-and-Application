🚩🍎Red Themed Montessori Discovery Basket❤️🍷
.
.
Though J has internalised many colours, I still find these colour themed discovery baskets visually impactful. I change them out once a week and J looks forward to opening his “Treasure Box” every morning because the colours are so bright and there’s a wide range of items in it for him to explore! 🍒

He would also understand the concept of colour of the week... and this week, he pointed out all the red things he saw in the house! 🍉🍎🌶🍓 So for instance, instead of merely calling an apple an Apple, he would say, “Red Apple”. .
.
Although I tried to incorporate as many natural items as possible, I didn’t have that many available on hand. However, I did try to include items of different material, shapes, sizes and texture for him to explore. Pieces that required some psychomotor movement like unzipping, snap buttons etc were his favourite! 😍
