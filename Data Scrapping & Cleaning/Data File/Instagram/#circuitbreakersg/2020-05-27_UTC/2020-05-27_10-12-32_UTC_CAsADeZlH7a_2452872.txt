I am with you, particularly on the cataclysmic climate change that’s coming into view and that will cause so much needless suffering. As for faith: I don’t believe in the Christian god, or the Muslim one, or the Jewish one. I’m sentimentally attached to some of the Yoruba and Greek gods- the stories are too good.
What do I believe in ? Imagination, gardens, science, poetry, love and a variety of nonviolent consolations. I suspect that in aggregate all this isn’t enough, but it’s where I am for now.
