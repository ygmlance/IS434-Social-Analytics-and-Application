Chicken Cheese Buldak (Fire Chicken) | Combined the sauce recipe by @adamliaw (but reduced amount of chilies because I'm faint-tongued) with @maangchi's recommendation for rice cakes and a mozzarella topping for a satisfying Korean comfort food experience. Perfect for sharing with the fam during this lockdown or best enjoyed with some soju and beer for Friday Happy Hours haha!
