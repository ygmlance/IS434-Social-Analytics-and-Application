Focaccia - with Cherry tomatoes, rosemary and cheddar. 
Did an overnight dough for this and I’m so glad it turned out so well. Husbang ate and asked if there’s anymore left for him and Arissa also enjoyed some of it too. It was definitely worth the many rounds of proofing! Thank you @melkmetko for sharing!
