To mark Day 50 of #circuitbreakersg I went down to @ponggolnasilemak to queue for a pack of this famous #nasilemak ! And I was not disappointed! While it might not look like much, the #coconutmilk #rice was still as #fragrant and #yummy and became #irresistible when the sweet #chillipaste (in the tiny packet) was mixed into the rice! I would have been satisfied with a meal of just the #coconutmilkrice , #chilli , cucumbers and #ikanbilis ! #supportlocal #savefnbsg #staysafe #sgunited #latergram
