“Is this apple juice nice?”
“It’s damn F*CKING NICE”
“Okay we’ll get it 😛” .

We first tried this with a bunch of friends at a small Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn. Definitely couldn’t say no to the waitress’s strong recommendation 😂, and indeed, it was REALLY good.

You can get this “Sterling Foods Tsugaru Kanjuku Ringo Juice White Label, Apple” from @amazon.sg 💛 Try it! 🙂
