It's hard to get mushroom from Japan in SG & feel so lucky I managed to found them from SnackFirst. They are aromatic & tender even after long hours cooking 🍄 .
Never thought that their freebie became my lifesaver during my first trimester of pregnancy (ya those days struggled with "all day" sickness)😂😂😂
.
Their dried apricot taste so so so nice! So... I ordered again with other snacks from them just to help me stave off my morning sickness. .
The dried fruits became Ms Seng's favorite snack too😌😌😌 so end up I need to hide them somewhere she couldn't reach😈😈😈
