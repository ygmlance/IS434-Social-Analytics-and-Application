Are you craving for Japanese food but don't want to hurt your pocket?
.
Japanese food is always one of my favourite cuisine. Teriyaki Salmon and Teriyaki Chicken are always my favourite choices.
.
WATAMI provides enjoyable and casual taste of Japanese delicacies for customers outside Japan as well as a comfortable and great dining experience at reasonable prices with friendly services. It is offering a Family Value Bundle promotion (Buy 2 Value Meals Get 2 Budget Meals FREE). Super value for money! 👍
.
Featuring the Value Meals (Wagyu Tendon Nikomi bento and Teriyaki Salmon Bento) and Budget Meals (Teriyaki Chicken set and Roasted Mackerel set). Our favourite is the Wagyu Tendon Nikomi Bento. It is quite tender. The roasted mackerel is well roasted and not dry.
