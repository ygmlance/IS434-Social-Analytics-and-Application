We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue our daily food delivery of over 200 meals to the residents of Sunlove nursery due to the generous support of our partner @extraspaceasia! 
To date we have proudly planned, prepared and delivered 6327 meals and almost 2000 homemade cookies. It fills us with immense gratitude and humility to be able to continue doing this until mid June.  #latteriamozzarellabar #strongertogether .
