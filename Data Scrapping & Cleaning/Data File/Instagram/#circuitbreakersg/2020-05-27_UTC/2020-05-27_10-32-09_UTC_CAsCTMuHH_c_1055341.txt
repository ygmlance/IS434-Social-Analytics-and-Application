Hi guys, I decided to put up some plein air to break the monotony of seeing food still lives. Hope you all are doing well. I’ll be putting up stuff made in Taipei awhile ago when I was there. I’m also commemorating the new re-edit videos of my trip there. This is from day one of Taipei 101. You got to get that in somehow! Don’t forget to tune in to the series via YouTube, links in my profile. 🙂
