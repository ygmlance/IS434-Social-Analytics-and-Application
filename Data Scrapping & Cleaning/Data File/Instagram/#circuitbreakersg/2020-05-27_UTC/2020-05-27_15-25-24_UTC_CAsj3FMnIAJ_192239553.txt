Almost reaching the end of cb and taking stock of how consumption pattern may have evolved somewhat
.
I love browsing bookstores and so does #theAteamSim but buying online has brought them immense joy when the deliveryman comes and quiet moments in the home as they inhale the pages
.
When veggies, fruits were scarce, online vendors offered variety and delivery
.
Sugar was a natural mood lifter so we indulged in some really luxe kueh salat
.
But these are temporary gap fillers and heading to the malls as and when I like, remains my favourite option
