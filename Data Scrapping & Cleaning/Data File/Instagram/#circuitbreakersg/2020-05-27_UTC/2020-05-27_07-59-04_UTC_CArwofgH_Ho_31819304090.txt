• Life is what you make of it.

If you solely focus on the negative, that’s all you will ever see.

But if you care to look beyond that, you may find the golden nuggets in the mud.

There’s no rainbow without the rain. And it’s only after the rain, comes the sunshine.

Press on, keep going. You’re one step closer to your dreams! 🏆💪 @greateasternsg
