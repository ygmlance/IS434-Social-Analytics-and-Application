We love using rice in our sensory bins because it is a great fuss free sensory medium.

Whether it is the texture, the familiar smell or the vibrant hues, children have always shown a great interest in playing with rice. If you've ever run your hands through rice, you'll know how soothing it can be.

Our rice is dyed with food-grade colouring so they are taste-safe and non-toxic. We make it fresh for each order so that the colours stay longer.

Visit www.lilfairies.sg and choose from an array of colours and pack sizes. Can't find what you need? Drop us a note and we'll customise something for you.
