That sums up our 2nd year wedding anniversary at home. Thanks to Covid - 19, well CB anniversary still ended way better then we expected. Special thanks goes out to our families and love ones for showering us with loads of love and pampering us with yummy food & desserts â™¡. The whole day from 9am till 10pm, it was filled with surprises after surprises with me opening the door every 2 to 3 hrs ðŸ˜‚. It felt like it was our birthdays! Thank you all for making our wedding annniversary extra special. Loads of â™¡.
