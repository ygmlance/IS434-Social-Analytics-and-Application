20 May, Dinner, SG - We had our favourite style of fish tonight: Hong Kong-style steamed fish! We love how the savoury and sweet taste work so well together and often got chided by our parents for drenching our rice in the sauce as kids hahaha. Served with spinach and carrot stirfry and prawn omelette.

Somehow... we don't remember the type of fish used again o_o #goldfishmemory
