When people send me emails at 1.30pm and expect an ‘urgent’ response by 2pm. It was not an emergency and also not life and death, just the sender being anxious and not knowing the concept of lunch time/toilet break/not gluing the laptop to my head wherever I go in house 🤦🏻‍♀️ #bangheadonwall #circuitbreakersg #ckcats #hdbcats
