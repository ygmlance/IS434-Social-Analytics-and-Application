❗Salmon is an excellent source of vitamin D ⁠
.⁠
There are two main forms of vitamin D: ⁠
✅ Vitamin D3 - cholecalciferol - which is found in some animal foods, like fatty fish 🐟 and egg yolk 🍳⁠
✅ Vitamin D2 - ergocalciferol - which is found in some plants, mushrooms 🍄 and yeast.⁠
.⁠
Animal-based D3 seems to be almost twice as effective at increasing blood levels of vitamin D as D2.⁠
