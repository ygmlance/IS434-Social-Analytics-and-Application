This is the longest time we've gone without seeing each other since we've been officially together.

And while technology is helpful for keeping myself and my boy connected, it isn't the same as meeting face to face. This time apart definitely strengthens our relationship.

We all go through millions of emotions in our relationship, and those emotions create brain chemicals that change the way we feel. Sometimes we are in a positive frame of mind (hopefully most of the time), and other times we can be neutral or even having negative feelings about our partners and ourselves.

I believe being able to trust your lover with your feelings is part of having a great relationship. Because when you share something personalâ€”perhaps that you areÂ anxiousÂ about something at workâ€”and your partner is supportive, it builds trust. It also gives you more strength to deal with whatever your issue is.

Happy 3rd year anniversary! @mrtimothyhuang
Jiayou! Keep safe and we can overcome this period.
