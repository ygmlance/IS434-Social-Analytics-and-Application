Circuit breaker is ending...so...🥶officially declare no talent in cooking still 🤩 .
.
and most of this are prepared by hub as it includes frying and i have never tried frying before till now, not that i am health conscious but am scared of oil splattering/ splitting around 🙃🤓
.
the one that i prepared, the steamed chicken, tasted like rock pieces 🌝  #circuitbreakersg #lunch #stayhome  #homecookedmeal #ineverfryanything
