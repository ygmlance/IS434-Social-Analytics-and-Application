🎁 G I V E A W A Y: Mustela x BabySafe 🎁
-
My children have been holding me ransom for what’s on this limited edition Happy Family Tips poster 😩 They have every right to, and they’d remind me with “Mummy, I thought you put ‘Make Time to Play’ with your name on it? Why are you always on your <handphone/laptop>??” 😔
-
I’m guilty as charged. With kids, it’s so important to make time to PLAY and... just be silly and have a good laugh together! To be honest - it’s not a walk in the park when #HBL + #WFH + #schoolholidays collide! 🙊Thank goodness I bought a pack of UNO cards for this #CircuitBreaker period🤣
