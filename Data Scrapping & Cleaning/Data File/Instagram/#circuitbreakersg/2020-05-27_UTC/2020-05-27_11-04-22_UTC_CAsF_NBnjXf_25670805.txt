exactly one year ago — decked out for Happy’s birthday dinner, followed by Straits Clan’s 2nd anniversary bash 🥳
.
boy, so much has changed since then, and like you, I’ve heard plenty of online sages advising us to “embrace the change”.
.
I promise I am trying: glam now happens with my fam, but in dressing gown and robe for nightly theatre, dance, or movies online. I’m cooking loads, but increased exercise means my abs are tighter than in this pic (but still no six pack!). my reading, writing, and mindfulness have increased, although one can never do enough of any of those. and my bonds with friends, even without mingling, remain tight.
.
yet I continue to long for physical interaction with my tribe, to discuss geopolitics, holidays, children, tall tales, fashion. I miss the soft touch of a friend’s hand on my arm as we giggle over something absurd. I miss the fairy air kisses, which sometimes leave my cheeks stained with lipstick from girlfriends who are like family. I miss my parents’ especially hearty embraces. I miss their human touch.
.
change is hard.
.
as much as I’m contented at home, existing happily with familial love and human connectedness through Zoom calls, I still long for more human exposure.
.
Phase One means I won’t be able to embrace those who bring great meaning & joy into my life, but at least we are on a path to our new normal, which somehow I will adapt to, absorb, and embrace. we don’t really have another choice. 💙
