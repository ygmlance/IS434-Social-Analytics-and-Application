chiffon cake with matcha and chocolate flavors!! aka camouflage cake as what the recipe calls it...was inspired by matcha kitkat and wanted to try patterns on chiffon cake hence the jumble of flavors ðŸ˜› a bit ambitious bc I had to repeat the steps thrice to make 3 diff flavors and then I was just randomly pouring the batter not knowing how itâ€™d turn out but guess it was decent! tbh for this amount of effort will just make 3 separate cakes next time ðŸ¤­
