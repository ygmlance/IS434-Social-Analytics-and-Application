Recipe for my Pork & Water Chestnuts Dumplings
.
Ingredients:
500g minced pork / chicken
200g of fish paste (optional)
100g Carrot, diced
200g Water Chestnuts, diced
2-3 stalks Spring Onions, chopped
3 tbsp #kwongwohhing premium light soya sauce 
3 tbsp sesame oil
White Pepper 
Mix all together and set aside to marinate at least an hr, longer even better. This round I omitted the chinese wine as the sweetness from #kwh light soya sauce is good enough. Chill dumplings before cooking.
.
300g medium prawns, deveined & halved 
Sui Kow Skins
When wrapping the dumplings add half a prawn in.

.
Chilli Dressing for Dry Dumplings:
1 tbsp #kwongwohhingsauces premium light soya sauce 
1 tbsp of #kwhsignaturesauces Black Rice Vinegar Deluxe, need I say more 
1 tbsp Dried Chilli Anchovies 
Mix altogether and spoon over cooked dumplings. I always add a little soup in the sauce.

Soup base:
My huge winning from @foodyo_cafe @hupchong No MSG pure Pork stock - it was so good and a perfect pairing for my dumplings. I added Chinese Spinach and coriander to finish this dish.

My Sui Kow & Hongkong Wantons Skins are from @handpicked.sg They have to be the best Iâ€™ve used.
