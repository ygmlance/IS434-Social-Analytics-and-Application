#Throwback to when @rubberducki3 had our Paella di Carne.

Who can resist Australian Midfield Farm Grass-fed beef, pieces of boneless chicken-thigh-meat, pork-and-beef-mix chorizo sausages, bubbling away in a pan of tomato-and-saffron stock, olive oil and rice.

Order some with the LINK IN BIO(https://take.sg/s/6582186969) or get in touch with our Contact Button.
