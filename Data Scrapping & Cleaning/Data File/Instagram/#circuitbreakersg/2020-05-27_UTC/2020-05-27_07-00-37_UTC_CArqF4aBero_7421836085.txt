Traditional study of Feng Shui is the study of land and water. There is nothing to do with putting items in the household. Understand that there is no perfect Feng Shui in this world, as long as the location (external Feng Shui) is ideal, and the interior (Internal Feng Shui) is configured correctly. Your Feng Shui is already well-taken care.
