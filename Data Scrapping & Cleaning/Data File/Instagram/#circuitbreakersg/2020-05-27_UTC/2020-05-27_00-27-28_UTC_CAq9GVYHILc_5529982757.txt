Trivia: Egg yolks will range in colour â€” from pale yellow to deep orange to even a bright redâ€”based on a hen's diet. Because free-range hens often eat more pigmented, nutritious foods that range from insects to grasses, eggs from these chickens often have richer-coloured yolks. On the other hand, conventional, grain-fed chickens will produce a lighter yellow yolks.
