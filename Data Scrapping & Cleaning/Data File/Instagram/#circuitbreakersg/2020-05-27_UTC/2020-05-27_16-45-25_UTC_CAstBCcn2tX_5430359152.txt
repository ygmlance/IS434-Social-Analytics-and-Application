Learning continues. Am unhappy with how the blueberries turned out on my previous post, decided to search for tutorials on how to achieve the colours.
.
I tried 2 different methods. On the left is technique from Anna Mason where she only use one colour - Winsor & Newton Payne’s Grey (mixture of Ultramarine, Mars Black & sometimes Crimson). The white powdery blue is applied as a base layer as the lightest tone and then work the darker tones on top. And each layer is build wet on dry.
.
Then the 2 tiny blueberries on the scrap piece of watercolour paper is technique by Youtuber Maria Raczynska where she achieve the colours with Verditer Blue + Quin. Violet and then build layer by layer wet on wet after each layer is dry.
.
P/s: I’m using what I have so the colours aren’t accurate.
