I can’t believe I’m just 3 years shy of turning 40! 😂 my hair is definitely lesser than before, my wrinkles are more than before, my eggs are old (I can’t reverse my biological age, that’s for sure! 🤣) but my heart and soul are forever YOUNG!
.
.
I’m officially THIRTY-SEVEN! ❤️
.
.
Being 37 means I need more time to style my hair, not because I want my hair to look perfect all the time, but at least I want my bald spots to get covered up! .
.
.
Being 37 means there’s a good chance my panda eyes will never disappear but hey I’m still a happy panda mama 🐼 .
.
.
Being 37 means I’ve realised age is nothing but a number
.
.
Being 37 means I know that the best years of my life are probably still in front of me! .
.
.
Being 37 is just as awesome as being 17 or 27! So bring it on! Celebrated my 37th birthday yesterday with my family at home. Every day I’m just counting all my blessings ❤️
