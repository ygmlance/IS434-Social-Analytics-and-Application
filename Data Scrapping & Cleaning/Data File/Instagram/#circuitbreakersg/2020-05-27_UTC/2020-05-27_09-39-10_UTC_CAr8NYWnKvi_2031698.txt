Day 51 circuit breaker thoughts:

When I own my breath, no one can steal away my peace and never feel ashamed of loving the strange things that make my weird little heart HAPPY ðŸ’•âœ¨
Focus on one strange thing at a time. Enjoy it, taking the most pleasant weird memories of it into the next strange experience ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ
