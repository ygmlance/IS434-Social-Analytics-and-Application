KITCHEN JOY PRODUCTS from @cpfoodssg 
Tonight I tried 2 of their frozen vegetable range which are sliced lotus roots and rapeseed flowers
.
Verdict
- surprisingly the lotus roots taste just as good as those fresh one from market
- rapeseed flower wise still maintain a good shade of green but taste wise a bit soft perhaps it will be good to make cream veggie soup
