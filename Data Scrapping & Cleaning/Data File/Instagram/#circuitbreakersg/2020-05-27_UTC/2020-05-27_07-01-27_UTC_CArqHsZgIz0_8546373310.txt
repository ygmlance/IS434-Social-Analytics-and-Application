You’ve had regular chicken soup but nothing quite like our Azteca we’re sure. A Mexican-inspired chicken soup featuring layer upon layer of flavour, our Azteca is every bit as nourishing with so much more. We even top it with crispy tortilla strips (in place of croutons), Mexican cheese and sliced avocado over top for added oomph!⁠
