Incorporating learn through play!

This was such an unintentional learning opportunity for us while Sophie was painting with the colour Red. 
We started naming items that are red and this little girl never fails to relate them to FOOD!

Watermelon, strawberries, pomegranate, cherry and chilli.. we are slowly expanding her vocabularies and dictionaries with her new found interest in the colour Red!

宝贝有一本《我的情绪小怪兽》@flipforjoybookstore ，书里的红色怪兽，代表着小朋友愤怒的情绪。

那…红色给你的感觉是什么？

当小朋友在接触颜色时，可以利用这个机会跟他们讨论那颜色对他们而言，有什么意义。 .
