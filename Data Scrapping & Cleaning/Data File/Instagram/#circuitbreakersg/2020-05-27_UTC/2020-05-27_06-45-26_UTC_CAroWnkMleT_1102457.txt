#CircuitBreakerSg Day 51! Thank you @rojakstory for the treat! Perfect for this super hot weather and save me from cooking lunch! ðŸ˜ŠThis Shake, Mix, Eat!!

The flavour is pretty well balance and refreshing with lots of interesting stuff in it like the fish cracker, quail eggs, cherry tomatoes, cod fish flakes, mango, green apple & pop corn chicken! ðŸ˜‹
