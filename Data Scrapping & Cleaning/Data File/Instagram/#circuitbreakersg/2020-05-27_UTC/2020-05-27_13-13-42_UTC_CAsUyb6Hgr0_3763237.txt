❤️Whipping up an AMAZING DINNER with @angiesoysterbarsg DIY cooking kit! We had the Salt Baked fish on Opeh leaf as well as the Truffle Kombu Cold Pasta. Both were fantastic and so tasty!!💯💯⁣

I was really impressed at how nicely packed these kits were and how easy it was to cook them given the step by step instructions ❤️ Idiot proof really since they labelled every single ingredient for you! Swipe to the last post for a video on the process😍⁣

@angiesoysterbarsg now offers island wide delivery of their DIY kits as well as ready to eat menu. We had their lobster roll from their ready to eat menu and it was great as well! Really fresh ❤️❤️Do check out their ig @angiesoysterbarsg for more details on their menu!⁣
