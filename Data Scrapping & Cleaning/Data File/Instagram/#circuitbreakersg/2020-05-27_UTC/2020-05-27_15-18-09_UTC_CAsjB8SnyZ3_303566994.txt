Mummy: "Berry, what do you want for your cake?"
Berry: "Hmm... want pink, purple, strawberry, blueberry and a pink ambulance!" Sent this request to @giebakes early May and ta-dah! Receives this awesome cake today.
 P.S. need to give credit to the 1st pic is taken by Giebakes cos the moment the cake was out of the box Berry start to sneak a taste of it every chance she gets! Fluffy sponge with slices of strawberries and suprisingly it is not too sweet. Ask Berry to make a wish, her wish was to eat the ambulance. Wish granted but luckily she didn't finish Amber. hahah later sugar rush no need to sleep. Happy 3yo Birthday. More pictures tomorrow~
