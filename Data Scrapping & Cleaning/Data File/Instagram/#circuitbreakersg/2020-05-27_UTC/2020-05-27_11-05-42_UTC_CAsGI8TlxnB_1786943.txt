One of my goals is to recreate this amazing drink I had at @matchacha_seoul and until this day I cannot for the love of God seem to figure it out. I guess if it was 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 easy people wouldn't visit them 😂⁣
⁣
In the process, I kinda accidentally created this drink which is delicious as well but not what I'm looking for. ⁣

In my attempt to make yuzu milk foam (cos I tasted slight notes of yuzu from matchacha's drink) I discovered that 2 tsp of yuzu concentrate mixed with milk using @nespresso.sg 's aerocinno3 milk frother makes this amazing yuzu milk that goes super well with the matcha! Tip: use the warm function cos all the yuzu concentrate melts into the milk 🤤⁣
⁣
I don't know if I'm supposed to add stuff to the milk frother but you know it's all about experimenting so pls don't scold me nespresso 😆 ⁣
⁣
The drink is a nice blend of yuzu and matcha flavours, although it is nth near the matchacha drink. ⁣
⁣
Hopefully I'll figure out how to make it in due time 😆
