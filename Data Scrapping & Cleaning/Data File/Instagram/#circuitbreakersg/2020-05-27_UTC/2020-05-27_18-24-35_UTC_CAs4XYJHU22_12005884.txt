As i have a small kitchen, i donâ€™t like to spend too much time heating myself in there. I like to cook all dishes at the same time in order to get warm food when served. 30mins preparation and 30mins to cook is the amount of time i give myself. 
Tonightâ€™s dinner, pan fry bulgogi, while deep frying the fish fillets, air fryer the fries and oven bake shell scallops with cheese (not shown in pic). Plan well and you can cook all at the same time and kill it in 30mins! ðŸ˜‚ Viola! .
