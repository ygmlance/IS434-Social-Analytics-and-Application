🥭🍈🍌😷🍍🍉🍊.
.
Started from Sunday (Apr 12), people not wearing face masks will not be allowed to enter the 40 markets managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or NEA-appointed operators.
The move is to safeguard the health and well-being of all stallholders and patrons at the 40 markets, which are relatively popular and tend to attract crowds over the weekends .
