This post came again so timely. This time, right after I snapped at my 19 month old for climbing and running on the sofa and nearly toppling down his bowl of pomegranates. I was working on my laptop at the other end of the sofa. He looked at me, so apologetic, and sat down next to me immediately. My heart broke. I took a deep breath and explained to him for my snapping. He just looked at me, said nothing, reached his little hands into his bowl of pomegranates and fed me one. My heart broke even further because I realised I didn't need to snap at him in the first place because he was just being 'a kid'. But I did anyway just because. 
I surely am his nurture, his home, his comfort, his everything. Even when mama is not all sane, he forgives me and he comforts me. If I am special, he is so much more. And everyday I am thankful for him. - Ashley
