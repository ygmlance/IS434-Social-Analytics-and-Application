#SGUnited ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ’™ Another functional exercise is Lunges! 
Improve core stability, balance, strengthen legs and bums at the same time improve flexibility / range of motion at hip joint! So important for all of us to keep moving to maintain flexibility in our joints and lower body muscle strength! We all move less due to Circuit Breaker Restrictive measures. Give this exercise a try and feel free to add more waterbottles or reduce waterbottles.
