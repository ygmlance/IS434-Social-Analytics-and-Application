Cir Breaker Day 23 Lunch.
Supporting our local F&B industry and of course satisfying our tummies at the same time with lunch delivery from Soi 19 Thai Wanton Noodles Thomson outlet.
I tried the Ipoh curry bee hoon for the first time, and it's pretty good. The curry gravy may not be the super gao kind, but it's fragrant enough and went well with the bee hoon and chicken cutlet. The Mister ordered his usual favourite wanton noodles with black sauce, which needless to say is delicious.
Happy bellies, happy people. Now to plan for dinner next ...
