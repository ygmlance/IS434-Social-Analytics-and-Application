During this Covid-CB, people like Joanne are even more hard hit because she now cannot sell her homemade cookies - her main source of income. Charities like Society of St Vincent de Paul are also short of funds with the cancellation of masses and people have not be as forthcoming with online donations (we know there are many who are still not sure how to). 😓 SSO is also not giving her much money as long as she owns a flat. She is adamant about keeping it as it’s her 🏡 and the only roof over her and her 2 girls. Without the flat, they will have nothing left. 
Do we not wonder then how most of us are so blessed? For me, I have many things to be thankful for - not only do I have a roof over my head, I can eat whatever I want, the freedom to spend money simply because I have a job that helps to pay the bills, and above all, I am well and healthy. So tell me, how can I sit back and not pay it forward by doing what I can to help this poor woman who is constantly plagued by financial worries and health problems (she is like a walking time bomb - just waiting to explode - she may not even live for very long to be honest considering the many health problems that she has 😢). I know that you guys must be quite tired of hearing me go on about Joanne’s cookies time and again. I sincerely thank all of you who have come forward to lend your support and love by ordering her cookies. 🍪 ♥️ It means a lot to Joanne even though she may not know how else to say it, so on behalf of her, a BIG THANK YOU!!! You know who you are. 😘 
May God continue to bless us all. 🙏
