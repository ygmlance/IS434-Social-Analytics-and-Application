谢谢 Aunty Chan 给的猪脚面! Pig Trotters Noodle! I suggested my mom to eat together with the crispy chilli from Kwong Cheong Thye 廣祥泰. More shiok! 🤣😋First time I ate tau kwa that has fish tofu texture? Is it vegetarian tofu or fish tofu? 🤔 Loving my BCM Soup for lunch! #circuitbreakersg #homecooking #dinner #lunch
