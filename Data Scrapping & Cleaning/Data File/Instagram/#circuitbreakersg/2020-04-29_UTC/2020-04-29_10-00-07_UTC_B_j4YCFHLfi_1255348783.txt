@davidbeckham and @aiasingapore, here's how I’ve been staying active at home and #EmbracingNewNorms for #HealthierLongerBetterLives!

Being such an introvert, I thought the #circuitbreaker was going to be a breeze for me. Little did I expect that I would get so stressed from being with my kids 24/7 that I got my first major #autoimmunedisorder flare-up of 2020. I’m in the midst of regaining my balance and I think a lot of you guys must be in the same plight. The world is now undoubtedly different and we have to work on #EmbracingNewNorms together.

One thing that is keeping me sane is my daily workouts and embracing this change. I recognise my “new normal” now involves working out with my kids. So welcome to the @kandiefamily’s weekly obstacle course! Guess who won? #霏姐 or #A等? (Swipe to see)
