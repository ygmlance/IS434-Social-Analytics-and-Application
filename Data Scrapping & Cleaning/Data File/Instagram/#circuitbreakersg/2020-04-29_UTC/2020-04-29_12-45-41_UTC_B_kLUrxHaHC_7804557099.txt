Dessert for two! #CircuitBreakerSG Day 23

Fresh White Sweet Corn 😋

Our favourite corn varietal after we stumbled upon it at a wet market in Hokkaido.
In true japanese pride in their produce, they  gave out freshly cut samples and they were oh so sweet! (We had never had raw corn before🤭) so this was pretty eye opening or as some fresh would say #lifechanging 🤣
