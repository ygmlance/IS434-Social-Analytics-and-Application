Stay home struggles are real. #CircuitBreakerSG means 24/7 with family, which can result in conflicts.

For your kids, a predictable schedule helps them feel secure and better understand expectations. If needed, parents can work on complex tasks while kids are asleep, or work in shifts.

Involve your kids where you can, like using role-play to help them understand positive behaviours or getting them to help decorate your workspace.

Older children mature enough to take on extra responsibility can help care for younger siblings, but give clear instructions and ensure tasks are age-appropriate.

Work on a routine your spouse and you are comfortable with, that includes designated eating times VS doing your own thing each day, chit-chat VS working in silence. Help each other out, eg cheer them up with memes or distribute house chores.

Split opinions on how to act during the pandemic can create tension. Don’t let anger control you—check your attitude and consider how your spouse feels. Agree to take needed breaks from each other.

Come up with a fun to-do list together, eg declutter, gardening, look through old photos. Families can also try indoor scavenger hunts, science experiments or DIY games: thecraftables.com/diy-personalised-monopoly/, slinkygibbongames.com/herding-cats-with-goblins
