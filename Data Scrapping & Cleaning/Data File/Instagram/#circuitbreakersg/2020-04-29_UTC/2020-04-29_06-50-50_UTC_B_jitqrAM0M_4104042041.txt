A car moving on a circular track. Since the car is moving in a circle, there must be a centripetal force. However the weight, normal force, driving force and dynamic friction do not point towards the center of the circle and they do not contribute to the centripetal force. Therefore the static friction acting on the wheels that is preventing the car from slipping out of the circle, provides for the centripetal force since it points towards the center of the circle. #circularmotion #acsbarker #acsi #acjc #hcjc #yjc #srjc #cjc #olvlphysics #alvlphysics #ibphysics #singapore #sgtuition #tuitionsg #physics #stayhomesg #hbl #hblsg #sghbl #sgcircuitbreaker #sgunited #stayhomeforsg #igsg #circuitbreakersg
