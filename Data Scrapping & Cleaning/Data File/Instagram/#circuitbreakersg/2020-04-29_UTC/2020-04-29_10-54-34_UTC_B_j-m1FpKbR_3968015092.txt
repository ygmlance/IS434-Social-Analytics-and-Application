🚍 My first trip out far from home after staying home for 5 weeks. 😂 Happiness can be simple when you are doing what you like. 😍 Never cope up at home when you are feeling down, do what you want so long its safe to do so 😷.
Although its just a trip to another supermarket but the feeling can be very different. 💝 During this 3 hours trip, I get to see how people adapt to changes during this period.👏 We will get out of this COVID-19. 🙏
