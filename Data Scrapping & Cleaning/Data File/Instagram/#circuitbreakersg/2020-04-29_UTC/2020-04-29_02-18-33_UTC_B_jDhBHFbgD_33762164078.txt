I love this NP leave in conditioner. It has a wonderful smell and leaves my long hair feeling so soft and replenished. . I have long thicker hair and this has become a new staple in my routine as it keeps my hair from getting crazy. Would highly recommend!!😍👍#selfcare #selfcarechallenge #bucketlist #iloveaveda #avedahaircare #avedanutriplenish #circuitbreakersg #AthomewithAveda #AvedaDaymaker #AvedaSingapore @avedasingapore @aveda
