My big boss told me to ration my food and asked me to cook a big pot of porridge so they can eat for lunch and dinner. Everyone ate 2 bowls but 1st bowl I served my big boss 3 big prawns and lots of ingredients then 2nd serving I told him no prawns for him bcoz I need to ration and keep for dinner.

I am a porridge n congee lover, super love tho I am not a rice lover. I grew up eating plain porridge with light soy sauce or sometimes my grandma would cooked rice and soup but I would pour everything together in a bowl and ate like porridge. I miss the juk at Seoul so I thought since the fam are eating porridge, I should also cook myself a small pot of cauliflower seafood porridge to satisfy my craving. Using the frozen cauliflower from @TheIronGrocer , the difference is evenly diced cauliflower and it's Âè£ÊÑü is also different,  less raw. I tried cooking before, using cauliflower that I grated but this should be much better or either that, I very long never eat liao so this time it's just super awesome. For mine, I cracked a Kampong egg into my claypot to cook and freshness of the egg from @TheIronGrocer just brings the extra oomph lah. You need to try it to understand what I mean, not I cook for you but you can go buy the ingredients shown here and ownself cook for ownself wahaha.‚Å£
