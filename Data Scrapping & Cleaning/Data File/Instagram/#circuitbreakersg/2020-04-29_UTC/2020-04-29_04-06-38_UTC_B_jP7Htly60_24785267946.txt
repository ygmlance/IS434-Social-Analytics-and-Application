Meat is a perishable food, thus proper handling is important to ensure safe consumption. Bacteria multiply quickly if the meat is placed in temperatures above 4°C. ⁣
⁣
To guarantee the long shelf life of meat, refrigeration alone will not work. Here are some quick tips on how you can retain its quality and safety for consumption:⁣
⁣
• Examine the recommended shelf life when you refrigerate or freeze the meat. Do not overstock your meat supply.⁣
• Separate raw meat from cooked or ready-to-eat food to prevent cross contamination. ⁣
• If you need to freeze the meat, divide into portions based on your serving size.⁣
• For frozen meat, thaw only the amount you need. Do not re-freeze meat that has been completely thawed out in the refrigerator or meat that has been thawed in microwave oven or in cold water.⁣
• Do not leave chilled or thawed meat at room temperature for more than 2 hours.⁣
• Prepared meat such as minced meat or meat cubes have shorter storage time.⁣
