29.04.20 Brekkie - Tortilla melt🌮 This is a quick fuss-free breakfast that can be done within 10 mins. Not much of a preparation required, just need 2 tortilla, a bunch of cheese and the fillings you like. My 👦🏻 loves ham🍖 so his came with cheddar cheese 🧀 and ham while the 👨🏻 ones came with bacon 🥓 and cheese. The 👧🏻 is not a fan of wraps, burgers or sandwich so she just get her regular dose of breakfast cereal 🥣 #whatimade #whaticook #homemade #homecook #tortillamelt #breakfast #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #橘子麻麻的廚房 #自己做 #早餐 #墨西哥芝士薄餅 #防疫 #隔離生活 #煮婦人生
