Day 23 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (29 Apr 2020) - Made #turnipcake #lobakgou #萝卜糕 #nofilter the night before for the #firsttime and pan-fried it for a dim sum lunch. Quite a bit of work, but such a rewarding harvest, made enough to deliver to family and friends. So #superyummy ! (Should have pan-fried a little longer though but couldn't wait! 😁). Ate with some chilli padi, light soy sauce and a drop of rice vinegar topped with spring onions; needless to say I didn't stop at 3 pieces, fried all the odds and ends from the cutting and ate them all! #stayhomewithascott #stayhomestaysafe everyone! #homecooking
