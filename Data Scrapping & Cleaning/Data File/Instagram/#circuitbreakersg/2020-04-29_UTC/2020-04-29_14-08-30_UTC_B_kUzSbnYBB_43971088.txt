To say itâ€™s a challenge to come up with a menu that every person in our household of six will enjoy is an understatement.
Mia is a picky eater - with an affinity for all things sweet - only. 
For dinner tonight, I cooked a noodle dish with some pork and homemade fish paste - topped with some leftover bacon (which I prettied and garnished at the end because I didnâ€™t have lard ðŸ˜†).
It was a hit with all parties except Mia. 
At least she made up for it by drinking two bowls of the coconut and black chicken soup I made (super nourishing soup for adult and children).
This morning, I attempted to make kaya with my #philipspressurecooker - and I was surprised by how little effort it required! The only slight problem was I went a tad overboard on the pandan - which gave a little bit of a green/bitter aftertaste (which I actually personally quite like.. hehe).
I wouldnâ€™t normally attempt to make kaya if I didnâ€™t have this miracle pot to help me cut down the cooking time significantly. I canâ€™t wait to enjoy this with my toast tomorrow ðŸ˜‹.
Iâ€™ll take orders soon! ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†.
