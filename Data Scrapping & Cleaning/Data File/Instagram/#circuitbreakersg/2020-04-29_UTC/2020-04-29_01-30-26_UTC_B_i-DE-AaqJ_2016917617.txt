Since we're still allowed to exercise outdoors, I've been doing just that;🏃🏿‍♂️ going for runs, cleaned up mt diet, edited some videos, connected with family and friends and done some reflecting. 
I've really been diving into #lofihiphop and lots of jazz lately, Billie Holiday🎼 to be exact.

Oh, we've also moved to a new apartment through all this craziness.🎬 Gonna film a video about it all today and I'll keep you posted when the upload comes.

Hear ya lata.
