Chinese pomfret porridge. Prep time: 15 min. Cook time: 30 min. Swatow restaurant serves this porridge and we have craving for porridge for our meals because its so comforting & hearty. this is an adult porridge because the whole fish is cooked with the porridge means there will be bones in the fish but, that means extra sweet porridge too. Key to this dish: sole fish must be fried till very crispy and brown. Powder half of the sole fish and put into the pot to cook with the rest, the other half save it to top off the porridge when served. 2 medium sized pomfret, washed with low grade shaoxing and cut into 5-6 fillets, marinate with 1/2 teaspoon shaoxing, light soy, fish sauce and dash of pepper. 2 inches ginger put into cast iron pot with water and rice. Bring to boil.  Soak 1 dry squid and 5 dried scallops in hot water to soften it. Cut them into smaller pieces. Put soaking liquid into pot for flavour. Medium heat fry dry squid and dried scallops until fragrant. add into pot of cooking porridge. Once your desired porridge consistency is achieved, put in fish and this last step should not take long so fish will not be overcooked. Serve hot with spring onion and remaining half of sole fish. ðŸ˜ƒ
