After much attempts , I finally made my own successful cup of Dalgona Milo ! üòã‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Ingredients used : ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
1) Ice and Milk as base ‚Å£‚Å£
2) 1 can of chilled all Purpose Cream ‚Å£‚Å£
3) 1 packet of instant Milo powder , using Milo Gao Siew Dai as it‚Äôs less sweet ‚Å£‚Å£
4) 2 tablespoon of sugar ‚Å£‚Å£
5) Some digestive biscuit crumbs as topping ‚Å£‚Å£
Whisk item 2 to 4 together . It‚Äôs really so much easier after using a electric whisker , thanks @rydenlee for getting it ! ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Topped with some digestive biscuit crumbs and this ice cold Dalgona Milo is good to go ! ‚Å£‚Å£I‚Äôm so glad that I learn and try out this latest trend during this circuit breaker period . Not gonna waste this time ! Probably I will do up more desserts posts to share soon ! Stay tuned , stay home , stay safe ! ‚Å£‚Å£
