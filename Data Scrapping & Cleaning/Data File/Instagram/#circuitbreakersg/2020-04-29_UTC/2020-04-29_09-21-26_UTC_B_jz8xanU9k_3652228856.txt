Coming to an end of a 8 weeks journey project. I am damn amazed by what Ketones can do. I was 95% expecting to bounce back and gain back all the fat at the rate I'm eating 😔. Cakes, brownies, cookies, ice cream, desserts, 3 meals🍔🍟🍕 + 3 desserts🍨🍩🍰 a day. I kept avoiding cos I didn't dare to take my photos. But I'm damn glad that I did sia!! 📸 If not I got no photos to compare liao. 
I was feeling f... lousy and overwhelmed with self guilt after all the gyms closed, my activity level 🏃‍♀️ also decreased drastically. Viscous cycling between eating to feel better 🔄 feeling bad for eating.

Anyways it is what it is! Going to continue drinking ketones 2 times a day especially when this CB is still on cos it just keeps getting BETTER ❤️ if y'all need some of this magic powder drink but paiseh can DM me secretly 😉😆🤫
