Singapore Eurasian Tea Time

I’m lucky to have such talented friends and so touched that they remember me!! Thanks for the shiok AF treats, Tinoq and Dylan! And thanks so much for making the trip down!
I’m rationing the sugee cake, although the peanut cookies are gone ... and I can’t wait to head back to ur place to dine on your great peranakan food once this covid madness is over! Let’s just hope I can even get a reservation la.
