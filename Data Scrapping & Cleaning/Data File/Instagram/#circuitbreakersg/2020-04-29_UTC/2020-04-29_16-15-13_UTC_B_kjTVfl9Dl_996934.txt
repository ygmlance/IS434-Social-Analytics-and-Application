#circuitbreakerday23 // Left the original #veggiegarden to the snails for their midnight munchies, and started on this garden rack instead. .
The #naibai, #chyesim, and #kailan seem to be enjoying the morning sun and afternoon thunderstorms, and are growing alright...but already, I‚Äôve noticed some telltale signs of overnight nibbling... üêå .
.
Spent another hour pruning the kaffir lime tree, that had such a bad attack of mealy bugs that few leaves were left after I was done.

Not a massive deal compared with the suffering of so many because of #covid19, or with us fighting day after day the recurring sin in our lives. Yet, the #coronavirus sufferers, the fighters of indwelling sin, and messed-up nature all look forward to the same thing:
.
‚ÄúFor I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.
And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?
But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.‚Äù (Romans 8:18-25)
