Starting out my mid-week positively with my go-to stretch. We never realize how beautiful the sky is until we learn to stop, breathe, look up and appreciate.

It’s almost the end of April, which means Singaporeans have survived close to a month of #circuitbreakersg and finally have seen a drop in community cases over the last few days.

I say our government and all of us are doing well, supporting each other and learning once again to adapt in hard times. I’m really proud to be here in our tiny little island #sgunited .

To the rest of the world, I believe that we’re almost seeing that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Let’s continue to hang in there and we will get through this together! #happyinternationaldanceday #internationaldanceday
