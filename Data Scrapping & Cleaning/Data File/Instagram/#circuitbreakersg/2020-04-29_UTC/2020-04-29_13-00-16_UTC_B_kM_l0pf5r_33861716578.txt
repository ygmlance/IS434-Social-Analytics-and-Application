Oriental Pork Chop | 中式猪扒｜

Kitchen Cheat | Premix Sauce

Brand: Lee Kum Kee Oriental Pork Chop Sauce 
Price: SGD 1.90

This sauce reminds me of 排骨王 Pork Ribs King. We didn’t have pork ribs/ pork chop, we used pork shoulders.

Prep time: 15mins 
1. Chop pork into bite size & dice an onion. 
2. Tenderise meat with a little Baking Soda. 
3. Coat pork cubes with corn flour. 
4. Pan-fry pork chop until golden yellow and done. The corn flour gives the pork a nice crunch. 
5. Add in diced onion and stir-fry for a minute. 
6. Stir in Lee Kum Kee Oriental Pork Chop Sauce and heat through.

Verdict: 3 out of 5. 
真的很下饭! This goes really well with rice!  But a little too sweet for me. Or maybe we shouldn’t have emptied the whole packet of sauce! 😅

Do you have any nice premix sauce to recommend? .
