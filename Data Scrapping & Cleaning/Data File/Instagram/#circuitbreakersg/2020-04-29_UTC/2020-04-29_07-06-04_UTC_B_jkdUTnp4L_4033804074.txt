What‚Äôs one of the best things about teaching online, apart from rolling out of bed and straight onto the mat? ...Being able to connect and interact with each other, virtually. I have discovered that I really missing personal and social human connections.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
That is why I am happy to be teaching online. The energy of the yoga class feels so much better, when we practice together (and have the video on). ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
I teach a blend of yoga that incorporates slow flow, mindfulness and tension release. Please see the link in my bio. I would love to have you in my classes ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚†Ä
