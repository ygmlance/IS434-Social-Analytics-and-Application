“When this is over, will you open P’s Fougasses, Focccias & Challahs?”⁣
“Of course not.”⁣
“You can add in a sign ‘Anyone who asks for sourdough will be banned.’”⁣
“I already know what font that will be in.”⁣

I miss being gifted freshly-baked loaves of challah. But I have to keep reminding myself “P you are in Singapore now.”. And pathetic as it sounds, I feel a little sad. ⁣
⁣
But I have an oven, two hands and a brain. So I’ve been playing with more challah. Then I found @la_boite Lior Lev Sercarz's golden challah recipe. It has turmeric and Nigella sativa in it.. exciting!; so I decided to whip up a batch of hawaij spice, a Yemeni Jewish staple to fold into my Yin-Yang challah. Sercarz also says add in yoghurt or labneh. For that one little tablespoon, I cured a litre of creamy fatty yoghurt into the tangiest cream cheese ever. Some of it, to smear atop the fluffiest and softest challah I’ve ever had. Drenched in Ligurian olive oil, and anointed with my own macadamia candlenut dukkah; of course I had to sneak some Peranakan in!⁣
⁣
And also test driving my very own preserved lemons, by roasting them with cherry tomatoes and za’atar. Dear lord. Oh my lawdy lawd. Maybe we need to make that Anti Sourdough sign after all.⁣
