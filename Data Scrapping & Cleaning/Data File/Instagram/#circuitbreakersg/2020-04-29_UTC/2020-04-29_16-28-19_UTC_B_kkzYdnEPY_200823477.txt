𝐍𝐈𝐍𝐉𝐀 𝐅𝐎𝐎𝐃𝐈 𝐎𝐏300 3.7𝐋 𝐏𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐒𝐔𝐑𝐄 𝐂𝐎𝐎𝐊𝐄𝐑

𝐍𝐢𝐧𝐣𝐚 𝐅𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐢 has 2 separate cooking lids. Pressure lid to sauté, steam, slow cook and pressure cook. While the crisping lid can air crisp, bake, roast and grill. There's no product in the market that one device can do so many functions:
☑️ 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐤
☑️ 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦
☑️ 𝐒𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐤
☑️ 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫/𝐒𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐞
☑️ 𝐀𝐢𝐫 𝐂𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐩
☑️ 𝐁𝐚𝐤𝐞/𝐑𝐨𝐚𝐬𝐭
☑️ 𝐆𝐫𝐢𝐥𝐥
This one-pot cooking also means one-pot cleaning. The ceramic non-stick pot is so easy to clean. This product is very popular in US, UK and now available at Singapore.

I am glad to have this @𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐣𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐠 Foodi multi-cooker delivered to my doorstep last week, hope to explore more #savetimeinthekitchen meals during this circuit Breaker period. Meanwhile, I explored some simple functions first.

When I received this multi-cooker, I was delighted but worry at the same time. I never use any pressure cooker before but Ninja suggests a short trial run with a pot of water to see how's it's done to loosen any nerves about using it and that's me 😅. However, it doesn't take long for me to familiarise it and start cooking. Thanks @gastronomic.kid, @xavvylicious and @singaporean_housewife for all your patience, advise and help during my time of exploring this multi-cooker! 😘
