🕖Dinner:
-Stir fry cabbages with wood ear mushroom
-Cantonese steamed sea bass
( bought a huge arse sea bass, had portion it into two, keeping the other half for another day )
-Stewed Pork with Radish
Stewed dishes are always my favourites. I love all main ingredients in this dish especially the tenderness of the meat that caramelized with the soy sauce and other seasoning ingredients.
The sweetness and aroma of the broth was fantastic And the melt-in-your-mouth texture of all the ingredients. 
A scoop of the stew, almost gravy-like over the rice or noodle is absolutely divine.
