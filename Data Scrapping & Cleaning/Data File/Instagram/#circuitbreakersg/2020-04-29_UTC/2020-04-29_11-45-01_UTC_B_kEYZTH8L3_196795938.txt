#homecooked dish using inspiration from the Korean dish, Japchae. First, I boiled all the ingredients (pork slices, cabbage, carrot and noodles) then stir fried briefly with my japchae-inspired sauce (made of garlic, sesame oil and black soya sauce) ðŸ˜‹ If I had olive oil, I would reduce the percentage of sesame oil and replace it with the healthier olive oil! .
