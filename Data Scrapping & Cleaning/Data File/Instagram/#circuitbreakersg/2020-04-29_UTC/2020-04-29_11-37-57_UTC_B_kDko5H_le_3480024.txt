[Homecooked] Cir Breaker Day 23 Dinner.
After the heavy food earlier in the day, I'm trying to eat healthier tonight.
So I'm having airfried salmon fillet with poached vegetables and cauliflower rice. It's the first time I'm cooking cauliflower rice, and I added half an onion, think that caused it to brown excessively. Thus, my version is nowhere near the white pristine stuff i've been seeing on internet. Taste wise, it's actually very nice. Because of the extra onion, the cauliflower mixture turned out so sweet naturally, and I just seasoned it lightly with some salt and black pepper
