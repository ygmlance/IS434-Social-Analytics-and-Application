Love love love having quality food delivered. This umami-packed uni, scallops, ikura combo from @kabukesg totally lifted my spirits during this stay home period. (I mean, just look at that explosion of colours!) It was a tough choice between this or a Wagyu foie gras combo. You can also pair it with sake from their selection. -Q
