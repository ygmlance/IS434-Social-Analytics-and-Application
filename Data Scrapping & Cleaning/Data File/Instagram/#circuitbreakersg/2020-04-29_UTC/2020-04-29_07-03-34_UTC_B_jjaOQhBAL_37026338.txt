We are making this video after seeing a friend post about covid-19 with her kids. I thought it was a good movement. To make everyone including kids to understand the situation we're in right now. I am not a natural at talking infront of cameras ü§≠. This is just to share.

I did not explain to him or tell him what to say. He learn all this Infos from the TV. I am a proud mama. A child his age understand his surrounding and try to explain to everyone what he sees and heard on TV. 
Just like what Dean always say "Do the right thing. Stay home" abide the rules and regulations to help flatten the curve in our community. We got this. ‚ô•Ô∏è #stayhomeforsg
