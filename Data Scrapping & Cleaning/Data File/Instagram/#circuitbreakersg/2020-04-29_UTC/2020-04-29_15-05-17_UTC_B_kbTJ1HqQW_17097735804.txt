🌟Honey & soy garlic wings🌟

Adapted from the “Sticky Honey Garlic Wings” recipe by the ever bubbly and entertaining Seonkyoung Longest, with a few tweaks made.

Keep a close watch on the wings as they are broiling in the oven! One minute they look pale and yellow, but they may get burnt quickly if you look away and aren’t careful. So, remember to keep checking :) I would have added spring onion if I had some; I think they would really add colour and flavour to the dish.
