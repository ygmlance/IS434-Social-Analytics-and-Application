29 Apr 20 [#CircuitBreakerSG Day 23] :: How did a casual conversation about two pans turned into a delivery of 10 pots and pans!
.
May: Daddy, we need to buy two pans because our pans are scratched. You shopping online now? Can find something worthwhile to buy?
. Meyer: Okay can. .
. May: Cool beans!
.
Two days later, a big box arrived at our doorstep. Yay! My pans are here! After opening, I shrieked, "These are pots! Not pans! Oh no! Did they deliver it wrongly?" Nope. They were delivered right-ly. Meyer then told me he bought two pots on his own accord to replace our two end-of-shelf-life ones. As I dug deeper into our newly arrived package, I announced, "There are three pots here you know? Not two!"
.
"OH! Okay. Three then.“ was the answer I got.
.
Now.. so where are my pans. My dear husband said the pans were also on their way. I was grumbling at the heaviness of our new WMF pots and then the bombshell was dropped.
.
"Erm, you know ah, there will be a 13-piece pot and pan set coming next week hor. I bought the set because it's more worth it than buying just two pans." he slurred through his words quickly thinking I didn't catch them all.
.
"WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I exclaimed. What's the word to describe half cry half laugh? I only wanted two pans. Now, I have 10 steely shiny heavy pots and pans in total because my cabin-fever-suffering-husband keeps putting things in shopping carts. .
.
That said, these look like perfect Mother's Day gift actually! I[heart]you. Thank you for making me laugh so hard Mr Yang. One saving grace, the frying pans are looking rather handsome with a chrome trimming for the base! Loving it!
.
But we really do not need so many of these ya’know?
