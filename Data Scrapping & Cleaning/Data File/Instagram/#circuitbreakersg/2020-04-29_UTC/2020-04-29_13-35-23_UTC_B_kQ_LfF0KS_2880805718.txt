I used to collect beer bottle caps for memories. Nowadays I collect them for grip strength training üí™üèº

If you watch the video closely, you'll see that there's a crease in the bottle cap from the bottle opener that was used to pop it. The most important tip is not to bend against this crease, because that would make this extremely difficult.

More people have the strength to do this than the people who can actually do this, because the skin on the insides of our fingers tend to be pretty tender. So it's the pain that stops some of us from being able to fold a beer bottle cap, rather than the lack of strength. As a safety mechanism our bodies will throttle back on strength output when experiencing pain. So kudos to @bentillthend, the only guy I've seen so far who can do this without any specific conditioning. ‚Å£

And as with all things, beer bottle caps are not created equal. I actually picked the easiest one out of the lot to bend here because my hands are pretty beat. The Swiss and German beers that I've been drinking recently yielded bottle caps that are formidably tough. Swiss quality, German quality? It doesn't get more real than when you feel the hard metal cutting into your skin haha.

So how to train for this? Watch the video closely for the technical aspects like how and where I position the bottle cap. Also remember to squeeze with your whole fist. Just like lifting heavy weights, breathing in and "packing" your breath really helps, especially with the pain. And of course, practise. Collect some bottle caps and play with them while you're bored or watching TV. Over time you will develop the requisite strength and resilience.

I've witnessed firsthand my shifu bend two beer bottle caps between three fingers at the same time, and one with the flesh around his eye. I've also seen photos of a German bartender bending three beer bottle caps (German ones!) between four of his fingers at the same time in an old book on grip strength training.

I'm not aspiring to such feats right now, but who knows where regular practice will take me?
