We hope you are keeping safe! Following on from our Swish! Umpa Campa teaser video yesterday, we hope you are back for more (teasing)! 🤪🤪🙃🙃🤭🤭⁣

We invited some of our students to our pilot run of the camp - to raving feedback saying it was fun and engaging! (Fun for both the parents and children!)⁣
⁣
Well, here's the nitty gritty - 🤓⁣
⁣
Choose from:⁣
3️⃣ days or 5️⃣ days Camp:⁣
Week 1: 4th - 8th May⁣
Week 2: 11th - 15th May⁣
⁣
Group 1: 5 -7 years old⁣
Group 2: 8 - 11 years old⁣
(we separate the ages in order to connect better with the children in terms of activities and games)⁣
⁣
⏰Preferred Timing of class: 11:30 am or 4:00 pm⁣
⁣
💰Camp fees: ⁣
3️⃣ days camp at $34, or you can use 1 credit in Term 2 to offset⁣
5️⃣ days camp at $55, or you can offset in your paid Term 2 (if you had already paid)⁣
⁣
🔉🔊 Did we mention there will be a Grand Prize if you (and your child) is the highest scorer of the camp? (we will be doing activities and some quizzes)⁣
🤔 Does the Grand Prize have something to do with swimming?⁣
🤔 Is it a tangible product? ⁣
