Seafood soup from scratch

I finally got some ikan bilis from Prime!! Personally I won't exactly consider it cooking if it's from store bought stock. It has to be from the basic. I'm surprised at how plain the stock can produce this end result. Fish maybe? 
I used like 1 tbsp of big ikan bilis for this bowl. Strained to get a clear plain stock after cooking for 30 min then in goes the tiger prawns, napa cabbage, fish (coated with salt, cornstarch, white pepper in adv) and bay scallops. 
There's abt a tsp of dried shrimps which I fried up with a little oil at the bottom of the bowl. Ginger slices optional, finish up with chinese cooking wine and a tiny dash of white pepper. No other salt, soy sauce or MSG used. 
Golden rule again *do NOT overcook*

I am very fussy abt my seafood soup as I have my regular must eat places. But I really love this! I'm gg to practice more then I can start inviting ppl over again only for this. ðŸ’•
