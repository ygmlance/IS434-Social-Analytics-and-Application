Located at Upper Cross Street, Hai Kee Soy Sauce Chicken has been in operation since 1959. 
We spoke to James, part of the 3rd generation running the business. Here’s what he has to say. 
Hi I am James from Hai Kee Soy Sauce Chicken. My family has been running the business since 1959 and I am part of the 3rd Generation. 
When prompted on the current situation, he chose to focus on the positive. The current COVID-19 Situation has allowed them to focus on the different dynamics of their business. While business is affected due to a huge dip in footfall and many office workers working from home, the increase in lull time has helped them to regain higher quality control of their food. Hygiene level has increased and they’re looking to adopt more new technology to adapt their business further. 
Lastly, as a parting message to our followers, here’s what James has to say. Regardless of whether you are in the f&b business or not, this COVID-19 situation is a good time to scale greater heights. Technology is one good avenue to explore. Nevertheless, it’s always important to strike a balance.  Hai Kee Soya Sauce Chicken is open for takeaways and island-wide delivery.
