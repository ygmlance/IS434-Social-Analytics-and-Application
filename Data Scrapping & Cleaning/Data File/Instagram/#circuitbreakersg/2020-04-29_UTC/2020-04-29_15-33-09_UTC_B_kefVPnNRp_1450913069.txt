Something soupy, hot and spicy for rainy days like this. The thing about kimchi is that it is so versatile that it can be eaten on it’s own as an appetizer or it can be paired with almost any other staple food too and form a whole new dish altogether. Not only for that delicious stew but simply by frying it with garlic and adding water, gives enough flavour to substitute the seasoning provided in instant noodles. So wonderful don’t you agree? 😊🍜
