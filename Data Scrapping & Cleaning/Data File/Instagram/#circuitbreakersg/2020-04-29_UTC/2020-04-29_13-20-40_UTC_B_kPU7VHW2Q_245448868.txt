Happy birthday Daddy/爸爸! Thankful for your years of providing for us all and for demonstrating responsibility and integrity in this family. God bless you in the years to come as you walk closely with the Lord and may He grant you His peace and joy and grace.

Although this year we can't all meet for a meal to celebrate even though we are all in Singapore, thank God for technology that we can at least have an option of video-calling! Looking forward to a time when we can meet face-to-face again!
