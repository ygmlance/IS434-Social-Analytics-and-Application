It’s time to get on your feet this #PowerOnWednesdays as we get fit with you! As part of our #stayhomewithgeneco series, here're a few ways you can recharge for the rest of the week.⠀
⠀
Challenge yourself to a high intensity workout at @evolvemma! Free classes - Boxing, Muay Thai and MMA - are streamed daily via their Facebook and YouTube channel.
⠀
Or you can tone your body and get the abs you’ve been wanting to achieve with @fitnessfirstsg’s virtual workout lessons on their Facebook and Instagram. Enjoy a range of popular and home-friendly classes to keep those endorphins up!⠀
⠀
Having a stressful day? Nothing that a zen-filled @pureyogasingapore session can’t fix! Get your mat ready and heart pumping with daily yoga and cardio sessions available on both their Facebook and Instagram.⠀ ⠀

A good sweat session might just be what you need to feel good while staying in!⠀
