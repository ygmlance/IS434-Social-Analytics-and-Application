Todayâ€™s #1Day1GratefulPost2020 comes way earlier cos gosh how much I missed Mambo Jambo.

Skipped the past 3 sessions just to play it safe.
Which means the last time I popped down to Zouk was all the way back last year.

These past few weeks stuck at home just makes the craving worse.

So so so thankful for @zouksingapore for doing this livestream.
And for crazy friends to recreate a semblance of cheonging, somewhat.
And for alcohol at home.

Sigh. It perhaps is going to be a looooooooooong time before anyone can experience the real deal again.

For now, weâ€™ve just gotta be content with the alternative, no matter how bleah.

Guess, in this new normal world,
This will apply to everything else too.
