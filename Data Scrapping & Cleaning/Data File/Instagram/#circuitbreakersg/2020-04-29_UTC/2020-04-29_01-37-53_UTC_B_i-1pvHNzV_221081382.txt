I do have difficulty to draw Lashes, but my trick is to do that first, so if I donâ€™t like the lashes look, I just switch on the the next one, and use the previous one for another suitable look. Nothing fancy, I just use any regular black pen to create my lashes and brow hairs, itâ€™s easy to achieve Mac Lash4 ðŸ¤—
