I have friends telling me that they can don’t go to poo for few days. I wondered what’s the reason?

1. Never have enough fibre in your meals

2. Never drink enough water

3. Haven’t been cleansing your colon. Just look at a water pipe.... the pipe will get clog if you did not properly clean it. Applied to our colon too.

Don’t wait,  dm us for more information.
