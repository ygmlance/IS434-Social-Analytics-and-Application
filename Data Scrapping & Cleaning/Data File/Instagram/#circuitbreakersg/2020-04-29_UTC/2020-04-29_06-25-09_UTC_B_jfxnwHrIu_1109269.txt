My own review:
Parents pls do not forget exposing your child to household chores as they are as important as learning their ABC. I’m quite a strict mum perhaps so washing dishes, ironing their clothes will be part of our growing up.
I agree to a certain extend that most of us don’t allow our children to do certain things as we don’t want them to “suffer” but do give yourself a gentle nudge about “if you are not going to train them, then who will?” #teacherconnieactivities #homelearning #circuitbreakersg #sgunited
