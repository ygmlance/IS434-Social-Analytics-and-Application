Singapore [#FindingBeautyatHome Photo No. 11 - Work from Home Situation] Being at home all day errday got me feeling like Matilda before she was allowed to go to school. // Though I miss interacting with people IRL, I‚Äôm thankful for the time to rediscover my hobbies. Also thankful for internet and iced tea because Singapore‚Äôs heat is unreal rn. // Ok real talk though, the difficulty of being isolated is no trivial thing, but I‚Äôm grateful for a government that is trying to protect its citizens in the best, most effective way they can. See y‚Äôall in 5 weeks, hopefully üñê #singaporeathome
