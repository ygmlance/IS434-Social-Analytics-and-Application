Why do I say this? Because April has just flown by! And we have all been at home most of this time. Also, if youâ€™ve noticed, Iâ€™ve started having to use both sides of my notepad... Iâ€™m running out of pages and need to order one soon! YAY to stationery shopping online ðŸ˜Š also, shoutout to my favourite handlettering pens: @kellycreates and @kuretakejapan! #handletteringdaily #circuitbreakersg #lifeinthetimeofcorona
