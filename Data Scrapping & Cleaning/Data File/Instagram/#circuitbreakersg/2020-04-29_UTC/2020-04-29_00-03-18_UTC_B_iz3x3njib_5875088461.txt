What happen when children do laundry?
.
.
.
If you are looking at just getting ur child to play, watch their shows, do e-learning, you know it’s not enough to get them though the entire circuit breaker. .
.
Soon enough everything they do will be too bored for them copping up at home.

So! Get them to participate and do some chores! This is a great way to teach our children to have vested interest in the house and to learn to take up small responsibilities too! 
Tell me if it works for you!!!! I hope everyone is still ok during this CB period! Lots of thoughts! .
