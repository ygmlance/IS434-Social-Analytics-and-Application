We have come to Day 24 of #CircuitBreakerSG and I guess most of us have settled down  into the routine of doing #HBL and #WFH for some.

Families now, have more bonding time with each other. Geneco has since launched a #stayhomewithgeneco series on some ways you can care for your community, recharge yourself and bonding activities for the family.

We did a simple learning activity of growing a mini garden using green beans, drew on the egg shells (adopted the idea from @mumscalling), used them as 'pots' and the recycled the plastic egg tray as the 'pot' holders #Recycle Guess which is mine?

We observed the growth daily, gone through the life cycle of a plant and revised on the parts of a plant. Taught Vera briefly, what a plant needs to make food and showed her the seed leaves.

I got @xavier_chua.sg to teach her how overcrowding could have its pros and cons and how the plant in a harshest condition will emerge the strongest and tallest. It got me to teach her comparison as well since she is into Length now!
