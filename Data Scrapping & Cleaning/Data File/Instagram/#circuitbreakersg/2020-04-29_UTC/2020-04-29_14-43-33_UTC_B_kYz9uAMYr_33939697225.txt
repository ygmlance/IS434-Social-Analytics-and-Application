We made lobster broth from the lobsters yesterday. So it's a lobster bisque dinner affair with organic pasta for the Simlets today. I drizzled with a little truffle oil and this dish is slurped up quickly. I'm so glad my kids share my love for truffle oil. Lol. #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #lobsterbisque #truffleoil #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomewithascott
