Dinner this evening was a simple meal of reheated cabbage rice from last Thursday, and some blanched Pak Choy dressed with lard oil, Superior Light Soya Sauce, fried shallots and fried whitebait. Tasty and satisfying. ðŸ˜‹ #cabbagerice #blanchedpakchoy #stayathome #eatathome #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #nowastemeal #reheatedleftovers #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
