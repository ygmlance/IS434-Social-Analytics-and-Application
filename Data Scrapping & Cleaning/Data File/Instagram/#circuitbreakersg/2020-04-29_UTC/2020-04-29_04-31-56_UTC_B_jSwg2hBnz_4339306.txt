For only a short period if everyone plays apart #singing and #music help to #calm u down so u will blockout other noises with a good pair of #sonynoisecancellingheadphones 🎧 & hear only yr own vocal.  Let us pray for a cure to this #covid19 virus vaccination soon. Let us pray for speedy recovery of those patients who are currently isolated in hospital ward suffering and fighting for their life. Let us pray for no more increasing number of people get infected. #singwithmesg #stayathomesg #sgunited
