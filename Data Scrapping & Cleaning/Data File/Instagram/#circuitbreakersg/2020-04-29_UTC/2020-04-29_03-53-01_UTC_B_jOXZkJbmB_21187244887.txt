Book 12 of 2020 - This nostalgic coming-of-age novella gave me all the feels. That sounds like I’m too lazy to pen my thoughts coherently but that’s not so - more like, I don’t think anything I say can express how much this book stirred me. The well-developed characters, the emotions brought forth, the harsh realities of life that were taught to the boys in such a moving manner. The Body is a departure from Stephen King’s usual fare, and is all the proof I need that he is more than a writer of horror tales. #books #reading #fiction #stephenking #thebody #standbyme #novels #currentlyreading #fortheloveofreading #bookworm #booklover #bookish #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakerreads
