If you're not much of a gym-goer or simply want to mix up your routine, yoga is a great alternative for strength training. Here are some 11 yoga movement that may help you during Ramadan (IG only allow 10 videos in 1 post, So I have combined 2 yoga movement in the last video clip)⁣
⁣
🌞Suitable for pregnant women & beginner⁣
⁣
👍Yoga builds flexibility and strength — not just for the body, but also the mind, which makes it a perfect accompaniment for fasting. Make this Ramadan the perfect opportunity to exercise healthy discipline and devotion, to detox your mind and body, shed a few kilos and embrace some positive lifestyle changes.⁣
⁣
💎As you move through each pose, be methodical in your positioning and focus on controlling your breath. Take it slow and gentle.⁣
⁣
🎇If the reps suggested for each posture are either too much or too little, adjust accordingly to your current fitness level.⁣
.
🌞Minimum 3 sets for the whole 11 yoga movement ⁣
