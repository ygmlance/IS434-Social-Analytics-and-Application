Goliath was a giant. David was a shepherd boy. But when it came to defeating the giant, the shepherd boy trusted God to help him, and He did! When we face a task that seems big and scary, we can lead our children to remember that God is bigger and mightier.
üçâThis is a new arrival - Jesus Calling: My First Bible Storybook contains 20 beloved Bible stories, told in a simple way that young kids can understand, and also reflections about who Jesus is.
I also love the soft and charming illustrations - they are so lovely to look at. You can read one story a day as a devotional, or many at once as you snuggle together. 
Available for purchase, but note that you‚Äôll only receive them after the #circuitbreakersg
