A hidden gem, introduced to me by @kimchuan_boiboi & @missionsgcafes 
It hides many interesting drinks I dare venture 😋 The atmosphere was calm,
allowing me to finish some work whilst there 🤓 Yet that’s not the best part...

The Golden Malted Matcha is pure Gold 💖
One sip and it got me hooked!
I love how ‘gao’ (thick) it is,
combined the malt,
with the matcha,
with the right level of sweetness....
It’s just right for a matcha loving sweet tooth!
(if you like your matcha bitter then this is not meant for you, try the pure matcha instead)

I’ll definitely come back here for more new ventures such as their Earl Grey Chocolate!
< maybe right after #circuitbreakersg >
