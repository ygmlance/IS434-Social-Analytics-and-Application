Day 23

Today I give thanks to all foreign workers who leave their hometown and come to Singapore to help in our construction sites!

It’s a labour intensive job and has its own risk too.

It’s unfortunate that this pandemic had affected many of them. I hope that all of them will get well and return home to their families one day!

I recall walking baby K to school every morning and these workers will always greet us and say good morning especially to the little one.

They are just like us. Someone in the human race and working hard for their dreams!

Let’s thank them and send them positive energy and wish that all will pass this difficult time safely and quickly!

What are you grateful for today?
