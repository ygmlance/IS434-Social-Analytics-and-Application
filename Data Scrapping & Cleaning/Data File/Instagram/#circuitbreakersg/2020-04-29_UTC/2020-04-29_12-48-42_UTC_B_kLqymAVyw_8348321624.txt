Omg! Being a Kiasu Singaporean, I must admit that I also stockpiled. If not why I found zucchini that's going to rot inside my fridge? Anyway, I took out and asked my daughter to help to make them into zoodles and after making 1, she suggested making zucchini chips so she helped to bake them. Thank God for daughterüôå.‚Å£

I put 1 pc into my picky son's mouth and he asked for more. Yeah! ‚Å£
