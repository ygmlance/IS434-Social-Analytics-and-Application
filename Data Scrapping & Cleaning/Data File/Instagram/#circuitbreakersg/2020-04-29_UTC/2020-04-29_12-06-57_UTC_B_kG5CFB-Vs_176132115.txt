Hitam's doing well at her fosterer's place - especially since she's had more laps to cuddle with during the extended Circuit Breaker! 
We've asked them to monitor her resting breathing rate and have prepared our oxygen concentrator unit in case her heart problems recur. Her ringworm debacle is nearly over and we'll be doing another test soon to make sure she's 100% cleared! 
For now, she's purring happily and enjoying pets from her fosterer and his grandma in her temporary foster home. We definitely hope to see her soon!
