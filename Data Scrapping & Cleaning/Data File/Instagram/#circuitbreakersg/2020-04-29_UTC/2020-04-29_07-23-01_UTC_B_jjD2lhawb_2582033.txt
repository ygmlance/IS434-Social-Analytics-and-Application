Beautiful Bamia is when the gravy is rich and thick. 
Cooking Bamia Tips
ðŸ¥˜The usual proportion of onions and meat is always 1:1 
Donâ€™t skimp unless you want a runny gravy that is not gluey to your Roti Jala
ðŸ¥˜Bamia is not a 15mins cooking , but you can save time by boiling / simmering the meat with garlic ginger and salt while your prep the other ingredients.
ðŸ¥˜Pressure cooker will be of good help to save time
ðŸ¥˜When cooking is rushed, the gravy doesnâ€™t have time to thicken to the silky consistency itâ€™s meant to have.
ðŸ¥˜Use enough oil
ðŸ¥˜Always use toasted spices 
If you donâ€™t have time you can get the special blended spices from @sagaf.spices
