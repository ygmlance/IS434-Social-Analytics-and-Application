BKT - do you black or white ?
I like mine lean, white and spicy!!
What about you?
.
Bak Kut Teh - loosely translated to â€˜Pork Ribs Teaâ€™ is a local favourite and we canâ€™t have it without You Tiao (Fried Fritters) so when I manage to get my hands on some I didnâ€™t need to think twice what I was cooking.
.
.
This is simple.
All you need is a couple of ribs and or lean loin . One BKT sachet. A handful of garlic, skin on and thatâ€™s it!  After blanching the pork first (to remove the nasties) fill a pot with water (follow instructions on satchet) put in the meat and whole ðŸ§„ and boil till the meat is tender. Add a can of mushrooms if you like.
.
Best served with Rice, You Tiao and fresh cut Chilli Padi with Dark Soya Sauce.
