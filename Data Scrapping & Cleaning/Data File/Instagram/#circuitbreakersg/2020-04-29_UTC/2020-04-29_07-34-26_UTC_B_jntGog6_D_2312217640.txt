A familiar name at Ramadan Bazaars, @sofnade returns this year with a rather unexpected offering: 🌟 Nasi Ambeng🌟Smart move as it is probably the go-to meal for many families during Ramadan.

We are happy to report that the quality of @sofnade’s nasi ambeng is on par, if not better, than some established restaurants. We’re definitely not lying cos we’re fasting! 😉 Mak-Mak will always say “terasa” when a dish or lauk is done right; no skimping on herbs and spices which allows the flavour of the ingredients to be fully felt. Everything from the beef rendang to the lemak cili ayam and sambal goreng is very terasa. Chef’s kiss 👨‍🍳 💋!!! Butttt if you’re craving for what Sofnade is pops for, then the meatball platter is for you. Get the mixed platter so you get both chicken and beef balls. With the mashed potato and curly fries. Shiok.

Need more? Add churros platter to cart. Don’t pretend like you don’t want to. Post-terawih munchies 😚

Sofnade accepts same day delivery as long as you order by 1pm. Go check them out at Sofnade.com.
