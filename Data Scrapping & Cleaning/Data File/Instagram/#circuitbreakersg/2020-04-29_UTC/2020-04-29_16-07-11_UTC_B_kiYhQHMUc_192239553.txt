Didn’t know dental wasn’t an essential service but dentist can see you if there’s pain and no pre existing illnesses
.
Shipped this chap off for the only late evening apt the dentist had before he returns to the clinic next wed
:
Past experience doesn’t really help if it wasn’t a pleasant one and Boom was nervy from last dec’s one jab to extract 2 teeth
.
This time, it’s 2 jabs, 2 teeth and when  it was time for the 2nd jab, he almost lost it if not for mummy’s crazy talking and handholding for distractions
.
All done for now. The way he always grows his back teeth before the original ones are removed is a sure way for this vainpot not to ever look bogeh (toothless)
