COVID-19 is a virus that sees no borders, and treats every the same no matter where they come from. Now more than ever we must stand together no matter where we come from to help everyone get through these times. Here are some general organisations working internationally which you can donate to. However, it is also important to support individual causes who work closer to the ground to provide greater individual impact. Look ar aidhubsg.com under Other Countries for more causes to support!
