Sharing of updates on lockdown in Singapore (Circuit Breaker) and Malaysia (Movement Control Order) with @eexuanng on @meclinicmalaysia 
It's amazing how SG has done it with optimism and coorperation from the people. Thanks Eexuan for the eye-opening session!

Singapore's cases in the community now down to a single digit and 2 digits in Malaysia. Both sides are starting to ease the restrictions. Praying hard for flattening of curve and economic recovery in the shortest time possible.🙏🙏 Also quite amused to receive lots of questions regarding the double eyelid procedure @meclinicmalaysia  in the midst of a pandemic.😅 #covit19 #flatteningthecurve #mcomalaysia #combatcovid19 #circuitbreakersg #meclinicmalaysia
