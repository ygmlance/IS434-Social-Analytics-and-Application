Ordered #mdmlingbakery because I read so many good reviews on the paus, especially the Tau sar pau that looks so much like the one I love from a cafe which is not cheap - S$2.50, and that was in 2013. #redbeanbun #saltedeggyolkbun #pau #fooddeliverysg 
To be honest I also forgot how that taste like but Mdm Lingâ€™s pau is very soft, Tau sar is smooth, lava salted egg is flowy and generous. 
Making use of this Circuit Breaker to order more because orders above S$45 there will be free delivery (usually is S$88), because these paus can be kept in the freezer for two months.
