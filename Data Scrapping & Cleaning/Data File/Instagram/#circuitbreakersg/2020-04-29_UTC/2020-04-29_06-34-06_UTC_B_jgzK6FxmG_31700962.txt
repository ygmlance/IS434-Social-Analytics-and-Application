29.04.2020, Thank you to the ambassadors at Tiong Bahru Food Centre. Almost fainted while queuing to buy food (farest I have been in the longest time, though I live a few blocks away). They are so kind to care, help and even gave me a cup of warm water. I couldn't see their names properly as I am feeling too unwell. Wanted to express my gratitude. They are really there to help and it is not just about issuing "fines". Let's look at the big picture. We do our part as they have done theirs so well. May we achieve the positive result so well deserved that makes everyone proud for playing a part in this CB period.
