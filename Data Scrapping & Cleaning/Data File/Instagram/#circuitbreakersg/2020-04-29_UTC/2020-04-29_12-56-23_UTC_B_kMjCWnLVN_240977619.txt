Decided to go for a run instead of PT today. Took one of my usual routes and visited the up-and-coming estate which is all quiet now because no construction is going on this period. .
Remember the game I play to earn points during my run? I'm probably on negative today because too many people ran past me. What to do, I edited my route halfway and ran against the flow of traffic instead. 🤷🏻‍♂️
.
Increasing my distance with each session too. I guess I can really try for a marathon once this CB is over. .
Oh, and I added in another 100x4 counts of flutter kicks after the run because of @ytptofficial weekly challenge. 🦾
