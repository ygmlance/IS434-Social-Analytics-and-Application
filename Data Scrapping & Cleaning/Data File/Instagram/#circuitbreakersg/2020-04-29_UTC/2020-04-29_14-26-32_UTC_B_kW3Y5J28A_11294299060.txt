Nasi Goreng Indonesia, the national dish of Indonesia. And ultimate comfort food for the neighbouring countries Malaysia and Singapore. I made it in 10 minutes. Great dinner to whip up during lockdown.
Not fancy enough? Top off with a fried egg. Just add satay or ayam goreng! I had mine with crispy fried fish.
