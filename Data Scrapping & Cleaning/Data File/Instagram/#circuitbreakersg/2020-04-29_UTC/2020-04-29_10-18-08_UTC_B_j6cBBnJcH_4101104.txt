So @silver_ang challenged me to the CB challenge where we be each others accountable partner during the CB.. To be honest, I was afraid to take the picture since I have been pigging out on so much sweets and chips.. ðŸ˜œ

But I'm so happy I actually did!!! I actually don't see much diff but @oneclickwonders insisted there is! So this is a progress report as we are half way through CB.

Much as we tried to be on a keto friendly diet, we have received so much love from people sending us food, from donuts to cakes, to pies and pasta.. And even bbt.. Wahahaha.. Plus I have been stress eating alot of choc. Having a supermarket near us is not a good thing.

So we are grateful for ketones especially during this time when we have to stay in. If not I'll probably be very fluffy.

Even though I don't see much difference, which is a good thing since I thought I will become fatter, I'm feeling awesome.

I still have very long days and WFH is not helping.. We were up at 6ish this morning for an oine meeting and our last meeting last night ended at 2am.. And we have been working since.. So this is priceless to me.

If you wanna know more, feel fab, and finally put words and thoughts into action, to actually do something about it, take back control over food, weight/fat and focus, DM me!
