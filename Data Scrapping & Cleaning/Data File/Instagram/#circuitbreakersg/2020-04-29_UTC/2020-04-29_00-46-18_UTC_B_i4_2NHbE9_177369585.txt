Life is full of choices... I’ve made many wrong choices in the past and also many right choices as well... I believe this morning I made the right choice to get out of bed and move my legs butt and hands!!!
What about U??? Taking in sight of my neighborhood which on a typical day I will not have passed by... Even made a friend in the squirrel 🐿 I bumped into... His name was called “Terrific Day Ahead”

This Circuit Breaker is indeed a long battle... But it is a battle to win the war with Covid... Maybe not win, but at least flatten it... Legs are definitely aching now after the jog and walk mix this morning... Have a great day ahead everyone!!!
Stay Safe!!! Stay Home!!!
You’ll Never Walk Alone!!!
