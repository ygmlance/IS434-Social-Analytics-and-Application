As to abide by Government’s advise on the extension of the Circuit Breaker period, we would like to share with everyone that Amazonia will be extending its closure till 1st June 2020. As such, Amazonia will not be open on 30th April and will remain closed until the stated date or until further notice from Singapore government.

We can assure you that we will reopen as soon as the Government guidelines allow us to do so and it is deemed to be as safe as possible for all concerned.

Should you have any questions, please contact us via our email: info@amazoniafun.com and we will revert as quickly as possible. We ask for your understanding and patience should we be inundated with an unusually high number of queries, we will do our utmost to respond within 24 hours. Unfortunately due to the closure we will be unable to answer any calls made to our main number.

We wish to emphasise that this is a Temporary Closure in line with Government guidelines on the extension of the Circuit Breaker period as announced on 21st April 2020.
