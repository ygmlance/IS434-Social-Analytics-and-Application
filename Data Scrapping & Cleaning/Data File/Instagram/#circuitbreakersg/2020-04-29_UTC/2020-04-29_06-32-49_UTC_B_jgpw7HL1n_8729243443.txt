I got out of bed to make breakfast before J2 woke for the first time today (my kids usually wake ard 6 plus). Thank you to my awesome neighbour @chercherch__ish for buying eggs and hanging it at my gate yesterday. J2 had hard boiled egg. He ate it a few times so I think he should be clear from egg allergy unlike his sister! Praise God!

I’m thankful that Jack is able to #wfh for this week even though it’s more tiring for both of us. At least, he doesn’t have to commute to and fro work. It’s so hard to keep the kids away from him. He’s like a magnet so I tried to stay in the playroom unless it’s cooking time. (Swipe to see how his “new colleagues” working with him)

I’m so glad to see the cases coming down especially for community cases which shows that #circuitbreakersg is working! Let’s all continue to do our part and stay home till there’s no more cases.

I guess it’s going to be more challenging for parents when school holidays come as there’s no more #hbl to keep the kids occupied. Do you think so?
