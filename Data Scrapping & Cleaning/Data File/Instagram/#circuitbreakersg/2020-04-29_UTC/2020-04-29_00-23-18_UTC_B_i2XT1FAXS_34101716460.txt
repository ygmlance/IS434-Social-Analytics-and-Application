For breakfast today, I made double cheese and egg #quesadilla with a side of garlic flavoured #johnsonvillesausage. The saltiness from the 🧀 was enough to season the quesadilla so all I did was add a generous pinch of #blackpepper and #mixedherbs. Pair this plate of deliciousness with a cup of freshly brewed coffee (or tea) and I promise your day will start perfect!☀️☕️ #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
