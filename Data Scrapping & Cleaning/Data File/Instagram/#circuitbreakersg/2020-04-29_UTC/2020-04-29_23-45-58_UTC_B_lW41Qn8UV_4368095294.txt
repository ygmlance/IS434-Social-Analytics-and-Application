🐔CB Day24 - Breakfast ☀️
.
Planned to eat Khong Guan Lor Mai Gai, but it's all sold out... ... So make do with this never eat before brand SMH Lor Mai Gai. .
Final Verdict - 那還要問的嗎？Of coz Khong Guan is the Final Winner 🏆
.
SMH one has a this 🍄 mushroomy smell, not as fragrant though, but still good to eat.
.
Human, creature of habit... ... tends to prefer to good old one. I know it's tough for others (new) to win over the heart of mine. 💔
