dumpling mee sua for the night because a dear friend @daphaniesu  @_kang.wei_ bought and deliver chin kiang black vinegar for me! Soup is made up of 5 dried scallops, goji and bunch of large anchovies. dumplings are instant Korean ones for a fast dinner prep because, its baking time again. ðŸ˜‰ Just high heat boil to flavour the soup water. serve with favourite taukee & spring onion. ðŸ˜Š
