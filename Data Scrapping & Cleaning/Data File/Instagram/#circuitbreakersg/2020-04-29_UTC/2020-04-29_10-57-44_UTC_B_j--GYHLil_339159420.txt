#Circuitbreakersg Day 23
. 
Beauty in walking
.
I've never been one for walking as I always feel that walking does not give me that shiok feeling a run does
.
These days, my knees hurt when I run and the pool is closed, so I have taken to walking to get some form of exercise (my only exercise is to the kitchen ðŸ˜œ)
.
I don't like to plan my route, preferring to let my feet take me where they want to. Today, they brought me to the PCN towards the Stadium
.
The good thing about walking is that I get to soak in the views around me, a step at a time
