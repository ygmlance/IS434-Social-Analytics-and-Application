What the locals here call agak agak and what I call eyeballing the amounts... Play with the amounts as I do a lot of eyeballing the amounts...\n- teaspoon of yeast and tablespoon of sugar into about 4-6 tablespoons of warm water. Leave for about 10 min and what for it to froth a little\n- add about 1/2 cup of yoghurt to warm milk and mix\n- add first two mixtures together\n- about 1 teaspoon of Himalayan salt into 1-2 cups of flour and make a well\n- pour the wet mixture in and start kneading. Add flour until the dough stops sticking to the surface\n- leave dough in oiled bowl to proof for about an hour. Cover with wet cloth\n- take out dough and knead a little again and cut into balls of whatever size you wish\n- gently flatten and spread the dough into long flat oblong shapes, place some cheese on half the oblong and fold over and press\n- brush on some melted butter on both sides of flat bread\n- heat up pan to medium-high heat (watch the bread and don't let it burn) and add some ghee or oil\n- grill her up! 2-3 mins on each side and voila!  Enjoy! \ud83d\ude0b\u2764\ufe0f",
