By chance, today's meal delivery for the elderly brought me back to where I stayed for the first 10 years of my life. The same block is still there. The surroundings have changed for the better with beautiful landscaping now. What used to be an open area in front of my old block was where I played marbles with neighbours after our Ai Yo Yo teacher drama serial, played outdoors badminton with my Dad with wooden rackets in the evenings and was all too familiar with this big wave-shaped metal grid with red paintwork at the playground (where neighbours and I would challenge one another to jump off the grid playground structure that was like just 1 metre above ground and we treated it like the most dangerous thing to do in the world) has now changed into a multistorey carpark with newer HDB blocks.
