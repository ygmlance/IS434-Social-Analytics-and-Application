The Siwss beers that I've consumed over the past few weeks 🇨🇭🍺 ⁣

Thanks @hubersbutchery for offering this selection (and more) of Swiss brews. I do not recall coming across many, if any, Swiss beers anywhere else in SG.

Like all things Swiss, these beers are of consistently high quality. From lagers and pilsners to ambers and specialty beers, these brews taste fresh, elegant and well-executed. ⁣

If you're a beer fan and ever visit Huber's Butchery, be sure to check out their beer section for a considerable range of Swiss and German brews, many of them not found anywhere else on the island. This is a butcher that definitely does more than just meat!
