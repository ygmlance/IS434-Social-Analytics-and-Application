Did you know that Spinach contains a chemical called oxalic acid, which binds with iron and calcium and reduces the absorption of these minerals. To improve iron absorption, spinach is eaten with vitamin C-rich foods such as üçÖ tomato.
Also tomatoes are thought to originate in Peru. The name comes from the Aztec ‚Äúxitomatl,‚Äù which means ‚Äúplump thing with a navel‚Äù. And why is it called mozzarella? The name comes from the fact that the spun paste obtained from the curd is "cut off," that is, cut by the dairy farmers to be modeled in its characteristic forms, whether it is rounded, or braided.
