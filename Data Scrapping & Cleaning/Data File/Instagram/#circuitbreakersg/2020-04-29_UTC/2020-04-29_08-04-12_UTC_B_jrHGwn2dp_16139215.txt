hallo. sooooo this was supposed to be an illustration collab where i drew whatever pam was gonna cook for her IG live cook-along, but somewhere along the way she managed to convince me to get on the IG live with her so I GUESS THATâ€™S WHATâ€™S HAPPENING NOW. why would she put a no0b cook who can barely flip an egg beside herself, an accomplished chef and cookbook author who is capable of make freaking curry puffs from scratch? hMmMm?? iâ€™m not stupid, of cos itâ€™s because she believes in me ðŸ™‚

k jokes aside, i just wanna say that i had so much fun drawing these!! my fave part was defo styling my own yellow kitchen and drawing them cute tau poks. swipe to the end to see the time lapses of a couple of these squaresâœ¨

ok so see ya on sunday at 2.30pm for some Lor Mai Gai-ding over on @sgpnoodlesâ€™ instagram. i will try not to drop my phone into the saucepan but i canâ€™t guarantee that my Lor Mai Gai will be edible ðŸ’©
