If you have a love for interiors and accent pieces then you will love our Ankole Vases. The touch of brass adds a metallic tone and is a stand out piece in any setting. Designed to be multi-purpose, you can use them in many ways. We use them to add dry flowers inside because they last for months and they make the most gorgeous arrangement. We got ours from our dear friend @askafrench. Why not use  it as a wine bottle holder or for holding large spoons. The creativity it yours. A great gift idea!🎁 Simply elegant and a real talking point to put in your home.

Handmade in Kenya.
