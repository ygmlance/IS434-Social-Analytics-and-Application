Brunch today was my first attempt at cooking Rochor Mee, or what we now know as Fried Hokkien Mee. It didnâ€™t taste as rich as it should be, as i didnâ€™t have any prawn stock or squid, both crucial ingredients. Nonetheless, it was tasty and satisfying. ðŸ˜‹ #rochormee #rochornoodles #friedhokkienmee #friedhokkiennoodles #stayathome #eatathome #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
