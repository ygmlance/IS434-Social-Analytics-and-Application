Finally! Pics of the shirt dress that I made a few weeks ago. This dress was made in a #naniiro fabric with a border print (Drawing colors in black rexcell) and meant as a mockup for a client's request  because I was given a photo inspiration to follow and I found a similar pattern in one of my #japanesesewingbooks except I think this might be a little too baggy but I did not make any amendments to the pattern as the design is meant to be so. Anyway, any kind of test fitting is not likely to take place while the #circuitbreakersg is still in place so this will hang around for a while before I can proceed. 
I used the border print as features for the collar, cuffs as well as the skirt, and I want to ask for your opinions. Should I make a narrow hem to neaten the edge or leave it raw. I dont really like the idea of leaving it raw, but sewing a hem will mean truncating part of the border print making it less obvious. What do you think?
