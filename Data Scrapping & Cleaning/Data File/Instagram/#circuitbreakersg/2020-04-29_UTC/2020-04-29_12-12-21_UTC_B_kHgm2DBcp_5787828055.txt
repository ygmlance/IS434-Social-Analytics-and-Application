Circuit Breaker Day 23. Apart from working at home, I spent most of my time cooking, baking, dancing for Tiktok and watching Netflix 💃🏻. Staying at home can be joyful, hang in there and enjoy your time💞
.
This weekend, I’m gonna try making my own chocolate fudge brownie ice cream 🍨 and thinking of how to decorate my empty wall 🌈! What are your plans for the weekend? 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
