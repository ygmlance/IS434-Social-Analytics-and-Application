Both Jane and I love ngau lam, so we couldnâ€™t resist making some for #circuitbreakersg! This is a Cantonese dish prepared by stewing beef tendon & brisket with various spices. Oh, and served with a generous serving of rice / noodles to mop up the delicious gravy. It is rather time consuming to prepare, so itâ€™s best to make a big batch and freeze leftovers (if any ðŸ˜‹) #stayhomeandcook #sghomecooking #homecooking
