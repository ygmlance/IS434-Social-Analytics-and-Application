#circuitbreaker things!!! Followed a Bob Ross tutorial on our art date night (staying at my bf's house - since 4 weeks ago, and only leaving after the measures are lifted). It was pretty fun but paused the videos way too many times than we should have. 
Keep swiping to see close up shots & bonus of my bf's art piece 👏🏼👏🏼 Hope everyone's doing well, while many probably aren't, I wish that things get better soon!! #art #craft #bobross #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #lockdown #covid19 #bobrosspainting #acrylic #oilpainting
