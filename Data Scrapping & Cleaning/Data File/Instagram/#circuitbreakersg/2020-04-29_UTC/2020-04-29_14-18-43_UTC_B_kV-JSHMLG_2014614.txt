𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟐𝟑 - 三八豬白米粉 ( 🐷 White Bee Hoon) for today’s #lunch using AsiaJoy’s White Bee Hoon Paste I got from @fairpricesg ! Love using paste as I can cut down on cooking time during weekdays! All my #homecookedmeals are easy & fuss-free that can be cooked in 20 minutes or less! #Protip I usually prepare my ingredients the night before so all I’ve to do is to cook the next day! #savetimesavelives ✌🏻⁣⁣

Added squid, prawns, pacific clams, lean pork, nai bai & egg to my white bee hoon. Can I just say that I love @nuyolksg’s eggs? Look at that gorgeous shade! #notsponsored Just wanna share on quality eggs 🍳! ⁣⁣
