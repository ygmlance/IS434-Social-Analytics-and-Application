"Do good, live in the most positive and joyful way possible every day."
.
How do we do that amidst the #circuitbreakersg? Perhaps the best way is to be patient with our loved ones around us.
.
Also, love yourselves and practice self-care.
.
You might then find renewed energy to go out and help the less fortunate. But first, start with ourselves.
