[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Nourishing ourselves with Singapore's first and only freshly cooked Bird's Nest from @PristineFarmsBirdNest!
.
I was pleasantly surprised to find these Bird Nest Concentrate (U.P. S$39/bottle) so warm and well-insulated when it arrived (as though it was just freshly cooked from my own kitchen). Importantly, there was a really generous portion of bird's nest and it was overall not too sweet. üòã Swipe ‚¨ÖÔ∏è for more pics and video.
.
What about giving this special surprise to your mum/ loved one? It is now at "buy 1 get 1 free" promo. Various flavours are available, and I tried the American Ginseng and Red Dates ones. #Dontsaybojio! ‚ù§Ô∏è
