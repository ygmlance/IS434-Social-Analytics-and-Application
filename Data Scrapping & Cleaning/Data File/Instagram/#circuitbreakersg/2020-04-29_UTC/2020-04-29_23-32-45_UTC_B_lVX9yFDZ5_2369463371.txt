How has Ramadan been for you and your families? .
Indeed, this year’s Ramadan is not the same as previous years. No iftar sessions with families and friends, no terawih sessions in the Mosques or void decks, no food bazaars to satisfy cravings etc etc. .
On the other hand, there has been so many blessings during this #circuitbreakerSG period, especially so during Ramadan. The blessings to have all our meals together - home-cooked, tapau-ed or delivered, the opportunity to pray jemaah as a family including terawih - even Izz joins in whenever he feels like it, decorating the house for Ramadan just because we want to, the extra pockets of time we have now that we don’t have to shuttle to office and back, reading stories about the prophets and having halaqah sessions on Islam, etc etc. .
Grateful for this opportunity to ‘reset’ what Ramadan is all about in our family and may we continue to preserve some of these family traditions that we started this year. .

Ramadan Mubarak, everyone! ❤️
