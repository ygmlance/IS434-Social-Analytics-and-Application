It’s been a Long week starting with a high fever and follow Up medical appointments, then the article that sent all our small business brains into a whirlwind. I started off angry, but then sat down to think about what I could do to make things better instead. 
Decided to switch around the delivery model for the art prints I’ve got and put in a 15% discount code 👆🏼 for those willing to wait till post circuit breaker for delivery of their items. 
Meanwhile, Emma (@blueberrybooks.co) says hello! #kkslittlepeople #blueberrybooks #loveyouanywaybook .
