Does being on a diet to lose weight means that you can't have junk food?
The key to losing weight is being on a caloric deficit, which means your calorie expenditure should be more than your caloric intake! 
Indulging in your favourite food once a week would not spoil your progress!
I am not encouraging everyone to indulge in junk food, but just debunking a myth that everyone thinks it's true!

想要減肥是不是完全不能吃垃圾食物？
熱量赤字才是減重的關鍵，消耗的能量大於吃進的能量！
一個星期偶爾一次吃自己喜歡的食物並不會破壞你全部的努力！
我不是提倡吃垃圾食物，只是這是大家都有的迷思！
