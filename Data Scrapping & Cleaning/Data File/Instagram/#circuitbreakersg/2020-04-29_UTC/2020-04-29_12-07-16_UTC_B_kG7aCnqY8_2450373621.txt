Would you believe that I drank Champagne with good ole Mr Teh Tarik zi char? Well, why not? With the circuit breaker, I can't have friends over to share  a bottle, can't have a bubbly for apero at a bar... and I have run outta white. So out came the Champagne! Indulgent,  much? 
As for the food, it was beef hor fun, salted egg yolk prawns and garlic kailan. Satisfying.
