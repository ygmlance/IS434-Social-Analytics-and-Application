Thank you for ordering a day in advance! 
We have to adapt to the Circuitbreaker measures. 
Walk in crowds is down to 29% and as everyone stays at home, deliver and self pick up orders are becoming a trend. 
We want to be organised and use our time to focus on dishing out quality food for all our ButterNut fans all over Singapore. 
The new systems involves a centralised link to order and also a cut off timing of 9pm for next day self collect or delivery. 
Thank you all for understanding w are evolving to serve you better 🙏😊 #sgunited
