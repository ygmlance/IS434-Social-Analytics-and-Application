🏠 Day 23 / 56 (circuit breaker days)
.
Ma familia | My dad thought this year’s birthday would be quieter and lonelier due to all the measures in place. While the world might be on pause, we still found a way(s) to make it a special one for him.

Three households, two time zones, one 6” cake ... that only the two most senior members of the family can enjoy. ❤️
