Another day staying indoors scanning old slides. It really is a pleasure looking at these captured moments in their ‘physical state’. Of time frozen at 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 time. How interesting it is to be able to review that very moment again? Alas, we know very well the possibility for that to happen; the only way forward is up — entropy can only keep increasing.
