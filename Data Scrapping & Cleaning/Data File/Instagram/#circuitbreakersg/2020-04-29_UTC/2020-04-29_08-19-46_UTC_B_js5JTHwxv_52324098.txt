No BBT, but have Haus Brew Milk Tea. The Haut Monde‚Äôs preferred choice of tea indulgence.

This tea is not too sweet and the subtle flavours is the perfect respite to beat the heat & humidity!! Not only are we enjoying it I‚Äôm putting it on my gifting list too! .

At a good value of $45.90 for 22 bottles (11 Flavours x 2 Bottles Each), it includes a personalised note (if you are ordering it as a gift, key under "Remarks"), a free Haus Brew Cooler Bag and free next working day delivery to your doorstep.
