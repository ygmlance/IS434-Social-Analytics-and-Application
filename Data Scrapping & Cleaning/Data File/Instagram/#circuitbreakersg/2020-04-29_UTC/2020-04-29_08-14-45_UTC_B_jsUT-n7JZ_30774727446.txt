“Alone we can do so little; together we can achieve so much." Bcoz of our common visions and goals as mummies and as women, we have came together to create this IG page.

We strongly believe that women, being single or married, must always keep up with consistent maintenance from inside out.

The strongest action for a woman is to love herself more, be herself and shine amongst those who never believed she could.

We understand that during this circuit breaker period, many mummies are facing challenges in fulfilling their multiple roles. Handling kids (including your husbands) while working from home is definitely not an easy task. Hang in there 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 ladies, we can surmount it because we are Wonder Women.

No matter how you feel today, get up, dress up and ☺️ stay home! 😂 Be the best version of yourself. The only person you should try to be better than, is the person you were yesterday! .
