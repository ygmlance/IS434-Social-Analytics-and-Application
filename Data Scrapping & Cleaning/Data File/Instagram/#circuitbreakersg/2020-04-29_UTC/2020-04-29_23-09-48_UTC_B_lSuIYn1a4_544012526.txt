Do you know that we need to lather for 20 seconds when we wash our hands?
.
During time like this, it is important to educate our little ones on washing hands. They love to touch many many things.! It is difficult to just explain about germs and importance of washing hands to our little ones!

Featuring the Wash Wash Wash Your Hands!  by @scholastic.asia I like that it is an educational and is so helpful in getting the message across in a song "... So just wash, wash, wash your hands 20 seconds is all it takes... Just wash, wash wash your hands what a difference to your health it makes... " A catchy song. Now @myprincetravis will remember he need to lather his hands for 20 seconds before he wash them. ============================
