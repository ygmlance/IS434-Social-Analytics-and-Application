Art Taylor - A.T.â€™s Delight, 1960. Listening to an album like this today makes me wonder if these guys knew exactly the sonic pleasures they would be delivering some 60 years later. I love how this album was recorded, obviously #rvg. This is the only album Taylor would record as lead for #bluenoterecords but he was a busy man back in the day keeping rhythm for Coltrane, Byrd, Miles etc. If drums and percussion is your thing, this album is a must have. Get the best copy you can find!  #arttaylor #atsdelight #daveburns #stanleyturrentine #wyntonkelly #paulchambers #potatovaldez
