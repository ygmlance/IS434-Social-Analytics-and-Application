Do you find yourself craving more things that 'you used to eat' compared to pre-#circuitbreakersg? I do! 
I know for some people it's sweet stuff like #bubbletea but for me, I've always craved savoury food... This order of #seankeeduckrice is just one of them - we craved duck rice and just had to have some duck rice...so we pre-ordered and went out to get it. 
What are you craving tonight?
