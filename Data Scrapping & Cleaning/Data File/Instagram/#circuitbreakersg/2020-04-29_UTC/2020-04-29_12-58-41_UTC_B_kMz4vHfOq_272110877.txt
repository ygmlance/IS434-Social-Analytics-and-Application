Day 22. Counting down to the end of a short week. Brunch - salmon fried rice with a sunny side up. Dinner - Mr. missing his fav teochew fish head steamboat. Prepared with whatever food I can find in the fridge. Love the sunset, the cirrus clouds reminded me of fluffy cotton candy. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood#spendingtimewithfamily #instadaily
