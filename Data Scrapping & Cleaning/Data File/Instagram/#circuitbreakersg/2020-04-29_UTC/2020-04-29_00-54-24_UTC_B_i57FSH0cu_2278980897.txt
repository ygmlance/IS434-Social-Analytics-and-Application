Working double 🧝🏻‍♂️I🧝🏻‍♂️ hard this Covid-19.
.
Singaporeans have been relying heavily on food delivery 🚲 options since the circuit breaker kicked in to slow the spread of Covid-19 with rules to limit the movement of people and business activities.

Food delivery riders caught in the middle, as F&B outlets and delivery platforms tussle over commissions.
Grab has refuted claims that it “quietly” pulled the plug on a popular monthly food delivery subscription plan without giving users notice of the change.
Grab is not the only food delivery service that has put a stop to its subscription plans.

Some GrabFood users were displeased with Grab’s move to scrap its food delivery plan. Nevertheless I am still thankful that we had them delivering our needs to our doorstep.
