I'm grateful/thankful for many things but I wanna share 2 things. Today I'm grateful for being alive, waking up to a brand new day.⁣

I'm grateful for technology, especially in times like this during circuit breaker / MCO / stay home. Everyone being stuck at home & only able to use technology as a communication & connection tool, especially with friends over at different countries. ❤️⁣

What are you grateful for today?⁣
