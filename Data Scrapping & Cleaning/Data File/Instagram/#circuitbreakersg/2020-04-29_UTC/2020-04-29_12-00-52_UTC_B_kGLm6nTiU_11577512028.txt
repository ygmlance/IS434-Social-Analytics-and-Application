“Ordered less rice 🍚because you knew you can’t finish”⠀
“Bought ‘ugly’ food🌽 because they are still edible”⠀
⠀
If you have done these actions before, you have contributed to less food waste!⠀
⠀
There are a few other ways we can reduce food waste:⠀
Come up with a shopping list 📋before leaving home and sticking to the list to ensure that you only buy what you need. This helps to reduce excess and unnecessary foods that you might not consume, and will eventually discard.⠀
Use leftover foods to make a new dish! Oftentimes, we discard leftover foods even when they are still edible. Actually, leftover rice🍛 can be tossed in a frying pan with other ingredients to make fried rice!⠀
Portion controlling is also one way to reduce food waste. When ordering food, be sure to only order what you can finish! For example, if you know that you are a small eater, try asking for smaller portions when you’re eating out next time after CB!⠀
⠀
Share with us if you have other creative ways of reducing food waste!⠀
