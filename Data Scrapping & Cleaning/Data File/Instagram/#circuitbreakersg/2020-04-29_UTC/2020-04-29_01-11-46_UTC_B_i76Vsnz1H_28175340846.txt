Did this simple and nutritious beverage with Milo Powder and whatever I can find at home ! .
.
The ingredients I used for this cup of Milo Oats with Banana are simply one packet of Instant Rolled Oats , one packet of Milo Gao Siew Dai (Less sugar option) and some sliced Banana ! The drink turns out not only yummy but filling and with a rich texture from the oats . Love it ! .
.
Swipe to see my video in making this healthy drink . It takes just 5 minutes to prepare ! Try making your own Milo beverages during this circuit breaker too ! .
