Just received a long-awaited @redmartcom grocery delivery order (#stayhome) - which started with squeezing my eyes shut when I saw the plastic bags... (We know it’s not always easy to stay green in these times of lockdown 🤷🏻‍♀️) But on closer inspection, the bags are in fact oxo-biodegradable! And they even come with instructions on reuse. It’s not perfect, it never will be - but it’s an amazing start. #smallsteps👏🏼 We can do this, everyone! ♻️
