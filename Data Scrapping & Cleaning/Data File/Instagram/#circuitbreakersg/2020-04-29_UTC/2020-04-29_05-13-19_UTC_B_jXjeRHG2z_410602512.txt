This minced meat with Cai Por dish suddenly flashed my memory few days back. Was a dish my late Grandma used to prepare. Tried replicating it by following my Mum’s instructions. Tastes yummy but some how lack of Grandma’s 味道 😔 Maybe I should get my mum to cook, will sure to taste similar or maybe closer to Grand’s version 😆 #todayslunch #porridge #circuitbreakersg #day23
