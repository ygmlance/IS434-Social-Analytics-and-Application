🦋How beautiful a day can be when kindness touches it! 🦋My day was made beautiful today via the kind greetings  from the bus driver and the pharmacy staff, an unexpected nice sky view, pretty blooming flowers and delicious steamed meat buns (大包) and char siew buns (叉烧包) from Nanji (南记). I always love the combination of 大包 and 叉烧包! Missing dimsum! Maybe next time, I should also buy Siewmai (烧卖) to make it into dimsum trio breakfast! 😍
