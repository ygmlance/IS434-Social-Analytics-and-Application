I have been on a journey to find what I am truly passionate about. I went into medicine and working as a Doctor👩‍⚕️ because I love to help others who need it. Now in this time of the pandemic when the whole WORLD is affected by this #Pandemic,
-

it became more apparent to all of us that there are SO MANY OTHER ways to help others (who do not require hospitalisation). EG Some people may need help to see the value in themselves (think the ER doctor in NY who recently committed suicide), Some people want to get healthier by being physically fitter, Some may be busy caretakers for children who need help running basic chores eg groceries/ food delivery etc, Some people need someone to believe in their goals and dreams. -

I may not be able to help EVERYONE, but if there's an opportunity I see, my CONSCIENCE won't let me go without at least offering what I can. -

I know that's a lot to think over a cup of coffee but ☕
-

I encourage you to do the same. See the value in yourself, and share that with others in ways they need most. Use your Talents, Personality, and your Passion. Be creative~!
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
