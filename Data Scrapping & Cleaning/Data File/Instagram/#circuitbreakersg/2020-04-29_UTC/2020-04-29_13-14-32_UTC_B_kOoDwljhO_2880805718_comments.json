I liked the H\u00fcrlimann, it's a simple but elegant brew; a great example of how beer doesn't have to be fancy to be good. I remember seeing a few Appenzell beers during my last trip to Huber's but I could not carry any more than what I bought haha. Good incentive for me to train and get stronger so I can haul more beers per trip. Cheers to you too, hope you and your family are keeping well during this time! \ud83c\udf7b",
