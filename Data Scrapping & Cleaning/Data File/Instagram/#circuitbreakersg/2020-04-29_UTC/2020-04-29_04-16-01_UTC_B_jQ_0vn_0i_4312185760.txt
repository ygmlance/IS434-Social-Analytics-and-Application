Received an early surprise from sweet gf Ms LLH! Everytime she makes her awesome liaoful radish cake, I wait in line to get a portion 😁🙇🏻‍♀️ This time I get it in the form of a special birthday cake customised just for me! 🤩 There's a butterfly, a dragonfly and there's even abalone! The orange parts were made from pumpkin! 🎃

Feel the love and so appreciated of her effort and time spent. THANK YOU!!! 🥰 .
