Porridge, Preserved Soy Bean (Taucheo) Snapper, French Beans & Onions Omelette and my all-time favourite Teochew porridge dish, Minced Pork with Fermented Black Beans😍. I added some luncheon meat into the minced pork when frying the dish for some extra 'Power'💪🏻💪🏻. So that was my not so 'Cheng' (Light) Teochew porridge lunch.😆😋
