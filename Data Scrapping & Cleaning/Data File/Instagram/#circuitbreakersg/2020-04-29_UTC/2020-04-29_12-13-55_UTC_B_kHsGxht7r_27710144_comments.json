However due to the current pandemic, we understand that it may not be very reliable (i.e. super long delivery time and parcels getting misplaced). As such, we highly recommend courier by DHL to ensure that the products will reach you. If you\u2019re keen on this, do drop us a PM so that we can check the rates for you.",
