Word of the Day - LIBERO
🏐
A libero is a defensive specialist position in indoor volleyball. The position was added to the game of indoor volleyball in 1999 along with a set of special rules for play in order to foster more digs and rallies and to make the game more exciting overall.
🏐
The libero remains in the game at all times and is the only player who is not limited by the regular rules of rotation. The libero usually replaces the middle blocker position when that player rotates to the back row, but the libero never rotates to the front row
