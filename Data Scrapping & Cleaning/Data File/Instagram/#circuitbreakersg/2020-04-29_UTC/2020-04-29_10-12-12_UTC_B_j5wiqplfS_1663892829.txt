Made a Youtube video (LINK IN BIO) of this Hot & Sour Soup (酸辣湯) inspired dish that was made from whatever I could find in my fridge. Although simple to make, it hit all the right spots for me. Yums, I was so happy with the soup that I think I am going to make it again!

In this episode of The Habits Doctor's Kitchen - I wanted to enjoy the familiar comforting taste of Hot & Sour Soup (酸辣湯) even though I didn't have the usual ingredients in most typical, standard recipes of Hot & Sour Soup (酸辣湯). So I experimented with whatever I could get hold of in my fridge and tried to create the familiar comforting texture, mouthfeel, and taste of Hot & Sour Soup (酸辣湯) that I enjoy a lot.

During this Covid-19 period, we need to be adventurous with new ingredients and be prepared to 'break the rules' of traditional recipes, because it is often difficult to get all the usual 'standard' ingredients for any recipes because most of us have to stay home, minimise visits to the supermarkets/markets which are also often not as well-stocked as before.

Have fun!
Blessings
