Parents. There’s always that one toy that you wish you didn’t buy. Today i wanna talk about Lego. Or their knockoff brands...Banbao, Sluban, Cobi, Kre-o, Wilko Blox .etc. .
Any one of you’ve stepped on a lego brick? Share with me your experience. What immediately ran thru yer head?

Do you know there’s science behind why it hurts so bad?.
