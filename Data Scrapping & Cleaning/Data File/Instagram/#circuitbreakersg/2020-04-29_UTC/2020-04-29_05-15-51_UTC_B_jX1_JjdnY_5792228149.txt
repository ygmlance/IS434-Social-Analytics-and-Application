Quick lunch fix after a townhall session and before the next staff meeting. Quinoa cooked with sun dried tomatoes, served with egg and sautéed long beans. (If you ordered the sautéed long beans from a good dim sum/Taiwanese restaurant, you can chill and eat it for a couple of days in various ways. The key is it must be made crunchy and oily enough.) #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #workfromhome
