Throwback dinner with prawn noodles, fried kway teow and braised duck rice from Zion Riverside Food Centre! 🥘
✨
My favourite is the prawn noodles as the prawns were fresh and the soup was robust in flavour without being overly salty. A pity the vermicelli was too tough for my liking! Topped it with Mum’s fried shallots! 🦐
