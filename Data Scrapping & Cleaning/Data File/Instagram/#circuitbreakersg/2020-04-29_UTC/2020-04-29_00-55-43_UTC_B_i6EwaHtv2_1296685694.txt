Last night Pork Knuckles was so good!😋 Been having supper with our nightly wine since CB days as felt cooped up and needed some happy food to cheer ourselves up! What happy food are you having these days to cheer you up? .

Sharing some info about the YALUMBA Samuel’s Collection Barossa Shiraz red wine that we drank since some of you DM me and ask me where to buy it and how much does it cost.
.
🔹 you can get it from Lazada online and one bottle cost SGD 84 .

Nice Australian red wine to pair with meat and here are the reviews about it that I’ve found online:.
.
”This is a well-balanced and drinkable yet food friendly example of Barossa's most famous wine style. It oozes ripe plums, licorice, dried green herbs, dried florals, warm earth and graphite nuances with a lick of spicy oak. The tannins are fine and chalky textured, and a line of acidity lifts the plump fruit, herbs and spice into brightness.”
