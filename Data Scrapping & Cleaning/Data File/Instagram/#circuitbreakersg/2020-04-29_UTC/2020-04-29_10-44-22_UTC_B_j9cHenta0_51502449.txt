Improvised Roman Carbonara - no guanciale, so I used bacon; no Pecorino Romano, so I used sharp cheddar. But got an egg and spaghetti! So, we gotta make do with what we have in the pantry!!! ðŸ˜… I learnt from the Romans - the secret to a creamy carbonara is to put a little pasta water while spaghetti cooks with the bacon, before adding the whisked egg at a certain temperature - and keep on mixing the spaghetti and egg mixture until the right consistency. I couldâ€™ve made the bacon more crunchier but didnâ€™t have the time today. ðŸ˜” This is one of the very simple pasta dishes that can whet oneâ€™s appetite to the max! #carbonara #pasta #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
