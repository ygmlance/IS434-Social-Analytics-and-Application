Much has changed regarding what we know about COVID-19 since it was first discovered.  @weimankow has now released an updated and extended version of her original comic about how COVID-19 spreads.  Please don't spread germs but do spread the word about how to be safe and healthy!  Take care of yourselves and look after each other! 😷💪🏻
