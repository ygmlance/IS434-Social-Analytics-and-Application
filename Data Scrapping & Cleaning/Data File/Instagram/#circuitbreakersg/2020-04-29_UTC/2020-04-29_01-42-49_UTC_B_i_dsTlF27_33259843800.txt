FRENCH TOAST TUTORIAL
🍞🥚🥛🧈
Some of you requested for french toast recipe using normal bread, so here you go! 
I find that this ratio of egg+milk is great for a normal bread. 
Also, what I like to do different is that instead of mixing sugar to the milk+egg mixture altogether, I like to sprinkle the sugar just on top. This allows the sweetness to appear more distinct with the same amount of sugar, thus, less calories is wasted (also of flavor that I personally prefer)
This method also gives out that gorgeous gloss on your french toast 🤤 
Btw, I used salted butter! Using some salt will enhance the flavor, so, if using unsalted butter, maybe sprinkle just a lil bit of salt along with the sugar. 
This is very very beginner friendly I mean, french toast isn’t very hard to whip up, but is surely delicious when done right! 🤩 
Grab some bread slices tomorrow, even chilled bread will still be okay, then whip up a french toast!
