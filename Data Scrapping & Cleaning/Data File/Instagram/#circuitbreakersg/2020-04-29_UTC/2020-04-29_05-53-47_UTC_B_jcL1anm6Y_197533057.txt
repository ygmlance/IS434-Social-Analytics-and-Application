As temperatures start to soar and summer is upon us, here’s a cool and delightful recipe , my #goto summer salad ! Gotta love the Greek for the origins of this salad 🥗 !

What you need:
👉🏼1 small seedless watermelon 🍉
👉🏼50g of cubed feta / feta herb mix
👉🏼1 sprig of fresh mint
👉🏼Olive Oil (optional)

How to whip it up:
✅Dice thé watermelon into inch size cubes and cool
✅Take a large salad bowl and mix the cubed feta with Olive oil and a dash of herbs (dried oregano, black pepper, thyme). Alternatively use mini herbed feta packs that are in a base of olive oil. I used @arlaapetina
✅Toss the feta , watermelon gently and garnish with freshly pinched mint.

Isn’t it delightfully simple ? It’s perfect for a summer afternoon meal !
