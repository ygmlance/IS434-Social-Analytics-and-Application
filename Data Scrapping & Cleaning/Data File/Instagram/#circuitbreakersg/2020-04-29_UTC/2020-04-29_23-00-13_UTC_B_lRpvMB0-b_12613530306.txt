Have you broken any circuit board today yet? ğŸ˜‰â €

Well okay this was actually me guiding my son in taking a DVD Drive apart (an irreversible process, from the way we did it ğŸ˜…).â €
â €
When I was little, I did take my dad's casette player apart and naturally, that did not end well as you would have guessed ğŸ™„â €

What's the worst thing you have done as a kid? ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜†ğŸ¤£â €
