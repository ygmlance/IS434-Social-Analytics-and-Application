As eerie and strange as it feels to be hunkering down in my house, watching society shut its doors and lock itself down around me, there is some part of me that feels warm and affectionate and so very proud of my fellow human  beings. Social distancing isn’t easy, but seeing us all band together to become a whole greater than the sum of its parts gives me some needed light and hope.⁣⁣

Stay safe. Wash your hands. Don’t hoard toilet paper. Take care of each other. 💕
