Another day of #noworksheets because, seriously, black and white words are utterly boring! 
Cheers to adding some colours to our #covid19 cooped up lives without adding mess to my motherhood life.  These versatile waterproof colouring mats that can double up as placemats are definitely value for money as they can be reused OVER AND OVER and over and over and over and over again.  You get my point.

Baby was involved too, she enjoyed chomping on the marker caps ðŸ˜‚

Tip to avoid staining: pls use their recommended markers which come off easily with a wipe.
