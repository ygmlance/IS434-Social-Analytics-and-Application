I miss having sambal stingray and stir-fried kangkong at Alexandra Village so I decided to cook my own at home! Results are satisfactory, the hubz said taste is 👌🏻. For the stingray, I used ready made sambal prawn paste from Singlong which is good (should have piled on more actually), along with aromatics like shallot, red onion and lemongrass, smoked sea salt and some brown sugar to balance out the taste. Just take note that the supermart-bought stingray wing contains more bones than what you will experience at zichar stalls. Craving for all things sambal, spicy and seafood satisfied for now!! Served with steamed tofu, golden kiwi fruit, strawberries and cherry tomatoes for a balanced diet. 😉
