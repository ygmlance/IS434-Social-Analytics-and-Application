Being cooped up at home may be a bummer... but let’s take it as a chance to pamper our skin! When else are you going to get a stretch of two months with no makeup, minimal sun exposure and lots of spare time to slap on masks right? If you’re looking for tips to achieve that #stayhome glow, check out my “skincare” highlights tab above which I will be updating with reccs throughout this circuit breaker period!

Ps. If you’ve got any awesome recommendations, feel free to dm me your reccs because I love buying and trying out new skincare... especially now that we are all cooped up at home! 🙈 #skincareaddict
