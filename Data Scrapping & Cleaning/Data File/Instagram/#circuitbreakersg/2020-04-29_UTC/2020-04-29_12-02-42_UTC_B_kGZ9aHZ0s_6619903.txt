All my freaking life, I thought #chweekueh was a #sgbreakfast food, to be had before noon on a weekend or public holiday together with a milk tea. Now, thanks to #stupidcovid19, Iâ€™ve learnt that it is a dinner food, quite well matched with a grapefruit Negroni. #lifewithcovid19 #covidmenu #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayathome #savefnbsg #sghawkerfood #tiongbahruchweekueh
