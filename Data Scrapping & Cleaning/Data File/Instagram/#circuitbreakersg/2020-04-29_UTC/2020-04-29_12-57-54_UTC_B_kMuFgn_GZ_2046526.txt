No hanami this year, no thanks to lockdowns and travel bans in generally every part of the world 🌸

Tried to make my own sakura-themed “home hanami” with @kirinbeer_sg sakura beer from @7elevensg and sakura mochi with red bean filling from @fishmartsakuraya. The mochis are wrapped in real sakura leaves! 🌸

Thought I’d post something non-covid and non-CB related for a change 😋 I’ve always had a thing for cherry blossoms 💗
