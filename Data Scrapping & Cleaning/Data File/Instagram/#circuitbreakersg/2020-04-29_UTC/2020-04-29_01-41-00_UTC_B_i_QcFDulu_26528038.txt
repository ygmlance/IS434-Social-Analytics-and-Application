This is my little corner of peace ✌🏻

Everyday at 4pm the kids get tv time and I run to my room to have some quiet time and maybe pop up some ridiculous videos on stories. The other day it was a meltdown but usually it’s little chats about local labels, jewels, and life in quarantine. Sometimes I add a cocktail to spice things up. I mean what’s more fun than jewels and a g&t?! Life outside, you say? Yes, I know. But that’s illegal right now. So let’s celebrate the little joys around us. For instance this morning I was up at 6:45a for a zoom surprise party and by 7:30a was already 2 glasses of champagne in. Already homeschooling is made way more fun. Today we are learning about doubles. Here’s two of something. 🥂 See...It’s math. And math is fun!

Not recommending morning drinking or teaching with 🍾 but today was a special day for a wonderful friend (🖤 @jasmine.x.smith 🖤) and a great way to breakup the Groundhog Day like scenario that is quarantine life. #day94 .
