The @osteopathichealthcare family had a little Zoom pow-wow this morning.  Great to see everyone was in good spirits despite Singapore's COVID-19 "circuit breaker". We even had some special adorable guests drop in on the meeting, @paddlingosteo.singapore's own two ankle-biters! 🤣❤️
Our fantastic team misses being in the clinic together and we miss all our wonderful patients!  We thank you for being patient and understanding during this trying period.  Team OHC will be back soon, so keep watching this space! 😷💪🏻
