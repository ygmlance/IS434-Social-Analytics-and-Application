Hi there everyone! Here is an update from us.
.
1) There are changes to the legislation for Home Based Business, therefore our deliveries will be postponed until further instructions from the ministry
.
2) Our website is still up for browsing and orders. Above are our promo details. Promotion is valid until 1st June 2020
**Do note that deliveries for the current orders will only be send out when the ban for HBB to use external third party delivery service has been lifted
.
3) Lastly, let's stay home and adhere to the government instruction very seriously so that we can end this Circuit Breaker! Let's also hope and pray that this pandemic will end soon. Stay home and stay safe everyone!
XOXO,
Momma Dee ‚ù§
