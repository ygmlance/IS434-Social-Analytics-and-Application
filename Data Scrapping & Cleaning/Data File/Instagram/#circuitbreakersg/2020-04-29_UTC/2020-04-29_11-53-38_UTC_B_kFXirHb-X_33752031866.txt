The once tall and beautifully lit buildings and towers seems to be in darkness;
The mad morning rush comes to a halt;
The empty stalls and silent corridors will worry you like never before;
Shall we not feel hopelessly lost;
Nor reveal our dissatisfaction. 
May it grant us time and space for unwind reflection.
