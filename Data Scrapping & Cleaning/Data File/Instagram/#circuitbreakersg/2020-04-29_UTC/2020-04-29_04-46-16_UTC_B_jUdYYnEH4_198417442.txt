💖Strawberry Biscuit Nougat from Stansberry💖

I don’t really like nougats because I find them either too hard or chewy and they get stuck to your teeth. But I love these sort of taiwanese biscuit nougat! 💓 It’s marshmallow soft filled with soft biscuit chunks, something like shortbread biscuit texture but not as buttery, pumpkin seeds, cranberry and raisin. 😋 This has a strawberry infused flavour that reminds be of pocky strawberry but less sweet! 👍 
Got them from @lazada_sg! A yummy not too sinful pick me up during this #circuitbreaker period. 😉
