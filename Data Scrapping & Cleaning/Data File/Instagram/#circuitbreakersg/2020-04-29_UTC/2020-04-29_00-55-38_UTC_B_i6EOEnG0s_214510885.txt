This has been a truly challenging time. On top of everything (and I mean every thing) that’s happening, my father-in-law is in the hospital for stage 4 CA. It doesn’t look hopeful - this is the point where you call the family at once to his bedside. And we can’t even do that. 
There are days when I’m just so overwhelmed with anxiety, it’s crippling. Every day we are forced to sit life out because we have an enemy we can’t see & can’t fight. 
But we are also praying together more often as a family, and are still able to be thankful for what we have, and how we are able to communicate with friends & family from long distances. When you are powerless to do anything, the only recourse is to surrender everything to Him who is all powerful and all wise.
