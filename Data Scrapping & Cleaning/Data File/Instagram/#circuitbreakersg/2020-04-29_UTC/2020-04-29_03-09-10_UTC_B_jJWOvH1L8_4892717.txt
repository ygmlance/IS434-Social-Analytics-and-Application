It’s day 23 of #circuitbreakersg and I am finally posting my food shots. I haven’t been doing it coz we are all trying to cope. While it isn’t a huge difference from my daily affairs coz i do cook daily, it has now increased to double the workload with cooking dinner and for almost triple the number of people. ⁣
⁣
Ordering groceries had been a pain. With limited slots, it means that we have to plan well. I am ordering stuff every week! Vege this wk, meats next wk, fruits every other week. I even have to resort to listing down my inventory and pasting them on my fridge.⁣
⁣
It’s tough to post recipes coz idk if they are good enough plus to list em down is a pain. Kudos to those who do it! But sharing is caring plus #fomo? Anyhoots, this was last night’s dinner. DTF’s pork chop fried rice. ⁣
⁣
𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐩𝐬 𝐚𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐬:⁣
4 pcs of pork loin (approximately 500g), tenderised by hammering till approximately 15mm thick. Make small cuts on the edge where the fats are to prevent it from curling up while deep frying.⁣
⁣
𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:⁣
#protip: Soak in Brine water (see below on what to add) for 30mins ⁣
(helps the meat fibres to absorb and retain moisture)⁣
500ml water⁣
Baking soda 2 tsp (10g)⁣
Salt 25g (5% brine)⁣
⁣
𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐝𝐞 ⁣
Light soya 1 Tbsp ⁣
Sugar 1 Tbsp⁣
Chinese wine 2 Tbsp⁣
Sesame oil 1 Tbsp⁣
Black pepper powder 1 tsp⁣
Garlic powder 2 tsp⁣
5 Spice powder 1 tsp⁣
Cornflour 2 Tbsp⁣
⁣
Wash off the brine water after 30mins. Do not pat dry. Marinate the meats for at least half a day. Deep fry it for approximately 1.5-2mins on each side. Let it cool and slice it up before serving.⁣
