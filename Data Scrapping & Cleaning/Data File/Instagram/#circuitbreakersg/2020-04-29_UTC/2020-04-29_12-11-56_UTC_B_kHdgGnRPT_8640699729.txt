Everyone's a WORK IN PROGRESS. 👷‍♀️ I used to spend much time at home, but I ❤️ how everyone's motivating others to learn, improve and embrace life now! 🤣👏
.
Some things I've been working on:
.
1️⃣ Halfway through an 8 weeks @coursera dog cognition course and committed to finishing it 🐶😤
.
2️⃣ Organising my digital files in cloud storage, USB and harddrives (reduces my carbon footprint too) 🤣
.
3️⃣ Using my digital drawing tablet everyday - which I've not put to good use since my days in art school, and taking some masterclasses. 😂🎨
