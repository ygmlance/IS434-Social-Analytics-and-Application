DAY 23 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
PUMPKIN SOUP
🥣🥣🥣🥣🥣🥣
This is something I have been making for the past 18 or 19 years, with some variation here n there. I used to make it once a week when my boys were little, but now its only once in two weeks.
I felt this was the best way to get my boys to eat pumpkin and carrot. It was sad when I saw little kids their age wearing spectacles, and did not want that to happen to them. I had to make sure that their eye-sight & immune system remained good, so I had decided that they will get their vitamin A regularly. They enjoyed the soup as little boys, rebelled sometimes as young  teens, not because they dont like it, but because its boring to have it so regularly. But now, as young men, they just eat it without complaining.
All you have to do, is get the base of the soup right, and then just add whatever flavour or spices you prefer. 
I used .....
🔸️ one small butternut pumpkin,  its easily available at the supermarket near my house 😉. You can use any yellow/ orange pumpkin (yellow inside, not the skin)
🔸️ one medium size carrot
🔸️ 2 medium size tomato
🔸️ one big flake of garlic
I cut everything into big pieces, and boiled it together in a pot till the vege was soft. You can put 2-3 cups of water to boil it, but when it is almost done, the water content should be only about a cup. 
Let it cool, churn it in a blender, and strain it to get rid of the tomato seeds & skin. If its too thick, add some more water. 
Now, season it with salt and pepper. Done!
Thats it. Not a drop of oil there. 
If you want more of the pumpkin flavour, just skip the tomato & carrot. Use only pumpkin. 
Some variations ...
🥣 Add some cream
🥣 Today, I put some roasted garlic bits, butter, paprika and fresh parsley
🥣 Just butter and fresh ground pepper
🥣 Season it with roasted garlic and chilli oil
