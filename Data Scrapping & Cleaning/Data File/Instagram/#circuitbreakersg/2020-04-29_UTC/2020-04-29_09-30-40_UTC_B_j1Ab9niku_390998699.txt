I bought a feast for 2 from Yuhua Hawker Centre because I abandoned my mission to shop at NTUC. The queue was long. I had to submit IC and temperature reading. Everything in the picture is delicious. The Prawn Noodles dry is the best. Fresh prawns, excellent mix of sauce, with crunchy pork lard. #supportlocalsg #circuitbreakersg
