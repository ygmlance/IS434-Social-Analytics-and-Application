Itâ€™s Day 48 of #circuitbreakersg and it looks like many people are out with their families not exercising but just chilling. I see policemen breaking up groups of women sharing food and gossip, families gathering on the grass patches and couples sitting on benches without safe distancing. It feels like CB is over ðŸ™„

I still enjoyed my run without having to worry about cars turning because my usual running route during CB is around my estate.
