2kg roast pork, 2kg char siew and 3 roast chicken. My boss aka hubby ordered these without my knowledge. Omg! These are enough to feed how many mouth? 🤦🏻‍♀️ ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Delivered some to both side of parents and we still have enough to go through 2 to 3 meals! 🤪⁣⁣⁣

Roast pork was crispy and good but lean. (Unlike the one I roasted it myself which was more fatty) Char siew was good too. You can skip the roast chicken. 🙊I find the meat not tender. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Ordered from Choong Kee Roasted Industries. Total damaged $153 ($5 delivery fee) ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
