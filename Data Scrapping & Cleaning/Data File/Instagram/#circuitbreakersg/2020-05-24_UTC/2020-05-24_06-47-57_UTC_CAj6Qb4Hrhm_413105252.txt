Circuit Breaker Day 48 - Had a go at making Mango Chutney & Mozarella Double Chicken Burger for the fam on Self-Cook Sunday. Infused a subtle Asian flair with the mango Chutney but thought the burger could do with more jalape√±os to bring out the heat. The beautiful butter rolls were baked by my mum, so they are fresh, pillowy, and won't stick to the roof of your mouth.
