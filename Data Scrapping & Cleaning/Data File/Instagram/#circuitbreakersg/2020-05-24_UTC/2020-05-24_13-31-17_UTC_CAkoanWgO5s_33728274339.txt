Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri to all our Muslim friends! 
This year, Hari Raya Puasa is a special one which falls during our Circuit Breaker period. While physically we may be able to have large gatherings, we hope that all those celebrating still can spend a meaningful time today with those at home, and keep all our loved ones in our hearts and minds!
