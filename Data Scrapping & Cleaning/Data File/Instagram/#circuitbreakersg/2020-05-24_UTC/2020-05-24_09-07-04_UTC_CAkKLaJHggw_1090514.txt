My first attempt at making crab cakes, based on a recipe I found on the @guardian ... How did I end up making them so ugly?! .

Thankfully, it tasted pretty good, according to the family. Iâ€™m ambivalent about it though, but have some ideas on how I can improve on the aesthetics the next time I give the recipe a shot! Or should I try baking it instead? Hmmmm. .
