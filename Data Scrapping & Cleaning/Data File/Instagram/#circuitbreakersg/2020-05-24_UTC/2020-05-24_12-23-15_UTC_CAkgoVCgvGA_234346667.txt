【Recipe】One of my favourite ways of cooking Beef strips. Spicy kimchi stir fry with leeks, top with crispy garlic chips. Yum! #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
This dish goes well with noodles, steam rice or even on salad. You can even change out the beef to chicken or pork belly, it’ll be equally delicious.

Spicy, tangy, tender beef strips with sweet soft leek🤤 很棒哦
