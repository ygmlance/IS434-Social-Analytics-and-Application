This is not your normal type of egg luncheon meat fried rice. There is a special twist in this fried  rice. Yesterday we cooked nasi lemak rice (coconut milk rice) and had balance. So we put it in the fridge and use it to cook fried rice today. Unique is u seems to be eating fried rice and nasi lemak rice at the same time as u taste both at the same time. Try it out and let me know if u like it.
