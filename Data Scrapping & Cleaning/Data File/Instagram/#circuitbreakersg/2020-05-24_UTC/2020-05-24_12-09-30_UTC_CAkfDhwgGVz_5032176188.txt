First of all, semoga semua melayu kawan kawan Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri! It probably wouldn't be the most massive celebration this year but making good food and eating together as a family could also be cosy time well spent in such pandemic times. ðŸ’š

With the circuitbreaker in place I have literally lost count of my dates, days and dare I say time as well. I only knew it was Saturday yesterday when the day was almost over. So to "celebrate" Hari Raya just to rub on a bit of the festive atmosphere, I kick my rotting body out of the house to get some groceries and ingredients for making kueh.

This isn't the most instaworthy picture but these gula melaka filled pandan flavoured dough rolled in coconut shaving #ondehondeh were a lot more challenging than the recipe look - partly due to the limitation of kitchen ware at home, the hard-to-handle sticky glutinous rice flour and also me turning into jelly beans from my gastric while I was cooking.

It was meant to be at least 10 pieces but the first few looked too deform so I pop them into my mouth as soon as they were cooked. That is how you remove evidence of failed food project ðŸ™ƒ. The pandan juicing process was a pain in the ass for that little amount of juice you get from all the work, I tried substituting it with bottled pandan flavouring but it just has that bit of artificial taste and doesn't taste as good.

I've been super shag from cooking meals, doing chores while attempting to write that I have been procrastinating over making sweets for myself. It's definitely worth the hassle to take some time off for self care with dopamine spiking hairy balls. Hopefully next time I will get improve process, tools and yield for my favourit-iest ondeh ondeh kueh.
