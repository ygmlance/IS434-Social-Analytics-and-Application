Happy Sunday! Yesterday I spotted these beautiful pink streaks in the sky for a fleeting few moments , and it’s things like these that make me hopeful for a better future . Recently @prisha_khimavat wrote a beautiful piece on #hope (link in her bio) by collecting various thoughts and experiences of different people and collated it into a heartwarming article of sorts. 💕 It made me wonder what are the various signs that people tend to associate #hope with , because I’m sure it’s different for everyone right...?
💕
So, what are signs of #HOPE to you? :’) .
