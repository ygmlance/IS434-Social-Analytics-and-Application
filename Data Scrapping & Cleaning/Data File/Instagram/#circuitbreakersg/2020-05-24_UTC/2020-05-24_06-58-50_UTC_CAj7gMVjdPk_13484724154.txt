Dear Muslim friends,

Selamat Hari Raya!
Eid Mubarak! 
Maaf Zahir Dan Batin. .

In Singapore, our Muslim friends can't do house visiting this year due to the Covid-19 Circuit Breaker Measure.

I am not sure if this is unique in Singapore, since young, I always loved to admire  the nice coordinated bajus worn by our Muslim families during the Raya period. Families in all green, blue, purple, etc, so cantik(beautiful). Things are different this year, as I looked down my window, it is a quiet scene. I hope that our Muslim friends could still do video conferencing with their families and friends to celebrate this joyous one month celebration.

Wishing all peace, joy and good health.❤️ This art work is inspired by the 4-fold Islamic geometric pattern and filled in with Zentangle tangle patterns as motifs.
