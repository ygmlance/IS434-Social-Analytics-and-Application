Looking for quality toy instruments to kickstart the  music interest of 2-3 years old has always been challenging for most parents. Mostly found the pitch of the toys are not in tune, poor quality of sound production, or it doesnâ€™t have any educational value.
â€¢
Today we are introducing a series of colourful deskbells. These deskbells have a very cute design with attractive choice of rainbow colours. The sounds of the bells are very beautiful with great resonance and projection. Each bell designed with different cute expressions that all kids will definitely love them very much.
â€¢
It is a great starting instruments for 2-3 years old because they can make music by using their basic motor skill. They can also learn solfege through the rainbow colours and practice their aural skill while playing the handbells with friends & family (in group).
â€¢
The bells are all well manufactured. Quality is guaranteed as each of them is a fine instrument by itself!
