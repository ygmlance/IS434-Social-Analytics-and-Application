Wow, 8 themes! It's been 8 weeks since I've started #CarouselleLearning and it's been so, so fun to create the activity sheets!
.

Except for week 1, the themes are the same across all 3 levels. Yes, I got more organized as time went by. 😅😁
.
I aim to mail out all bundles for the month, next week too! Meanwhile, I'm planning the next 4 themes - stay tuned!! :D
