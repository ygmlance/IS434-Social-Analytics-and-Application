*Stir-fried Mushroom Minced Meat Noodles*

Time-strapped afternoons call for 1 pot meals that are easy to put together! This is another of my Mum’s recipe and the kids & I love it so much for the robust mushroom flavour. This time round I added Shimeji as I have it in my fridge. Happy to remake another dish of my Mum’s successfully! 💪🏻 .
