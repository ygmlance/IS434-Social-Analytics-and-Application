Untouched, whitespace makes art beautiful...‚Å†
‚Å†
I have been consciously building whitespace into my life (well, NOW is the best time isn't it?). At first, I've found it hard to not schedule in that other Zoom meeting, or 1-1 coaching call, or catch up on that podcast, or tune into that other webinar. Clutter, clutter, clutter.‚Å†
‚Å†
For me, whitespace in the morning - about 1.5 hour from the moment I wake has been serving well.  Yes, my morning routine of light yoga and movements are within this time.  And I also have a good 30 - 45 minutes to just feel into what my body feels like in the moment, which sometimes is just laying down and doing nothing!‚Å†
‚Å†
Every little bit helps. How are you able to craft in whitespaces in your life?‚Å†
