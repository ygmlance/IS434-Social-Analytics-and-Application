Another journey to the west, to @breadyard to satisfy my matcha cravings! 🍵
✨
Croissant (S$3.00) - To be honest, this does not seem promising as it looks flat and doesn’t smell buttery. But once you heat it up, the characteristic buttery aroma emerges. The honeycomb texture is also 💯, meaning the layers are really well laminated. So never judge the book by its cover! I like that the pastry is light and not too buttery nor greasy. Thus, it’s pretty easy to finish it despite its rather large size! 🥐

Matcha cruffin (S$4.50) - Glad that I managed to reserve this as this was my main motive for my journey to the west. And wow, the matcha ganache is distinct in matcha taste and is so oozy. I love the bitter notes of the ganache, though it’s still quite sweet and milky for me. They are very generous with the amount of filling IMO. Oh and even the matcha icing on top has matcha taste to it, though it’s way too sweet for me and I’ll prefer it without. Another plus point is that the matcha here doesn’t taste artificial. Like the croissant, the pastry for this is crisp after toasting it up and doesn’t taste too heavy for my liking. I think this’ll be perfect for me if the sweetness level is toned down! 🧁

Overall, their bakes are worth trying and hit above my expectations. In fact, their croissants made it to my top 3 in Singapore! Service was quite welcoming too and thanks for helping me to reserve before I went down! 😊
