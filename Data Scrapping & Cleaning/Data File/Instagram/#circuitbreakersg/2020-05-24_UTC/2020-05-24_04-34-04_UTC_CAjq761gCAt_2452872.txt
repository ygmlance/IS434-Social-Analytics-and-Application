Maybe that’s why I write— in a journal. That feels right. I know I am alone, that I am the only reader of what I write here— but the knowledge isn’t painful, on the contrary I feel stronger for it, stronger each time I write something down. I can’t talk to myself, but I can write to myself.
- Susan Sontag
