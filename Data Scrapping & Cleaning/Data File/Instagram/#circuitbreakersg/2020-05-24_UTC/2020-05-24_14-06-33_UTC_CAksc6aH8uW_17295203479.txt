Over the course of #circuitbreakersg, it has been challenging in so many ways. While Iâ€™ve learnt many new skills and had the opportunity to do things I otherwise wouldnâ€™t have the chance to, it has been also very draining physically, emotionally and psychologically. Iâ€™ve had to become full time cook, concierge, cleaner (husband does help), comforter, computer technician, carer, complaints department HOD.

Iâ€™ve been blessed in this stage of my life to have friends who know me well enough to encourage me, to offer a listening ear and send me gifts of love when they know it would cheer me on and up.

Thank you! (Iâ€™ve not tagged all because I know you wouldnâ€™t want me to. ðŸ˜‰)
