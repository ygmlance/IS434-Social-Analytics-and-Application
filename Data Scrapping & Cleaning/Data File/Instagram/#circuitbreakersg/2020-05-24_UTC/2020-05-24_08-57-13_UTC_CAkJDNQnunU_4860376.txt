Today, I finally managed to persuade my mother to toss out this 20+ year-old oven toaster to which she’s inexplicably attached. The handle AND the knob fell off years ago (you should see her coax this creaky thing to life using a butter knife wedged into that slot); the veneer is so chipped off in bits ... and yet, she loves this trusty old thing that just won’t quit so very much. We’ve given her not one but two new oven toasters to replace this one over the last 10 years & they sit in cupboards, gathering dust. But today! It’s the dawn of a new era! Let us pause for a moment to celebrate this, perhaps my crowning achievement of this #lockdown period / this month / my life. 💪🏆🥇 #latergram #oventoaster #sglife #mymotherskitchen #singapore #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #quarantinelife #asia #cucina #kitchenappliances
