all time most ordered tze char dish: sweet and sour pork! We can always find many nice tasting versions of this dish but there is always something I dont quite like: flour more than meat. when you whip this up yourself, its proper chunks of shoulder pork, and in my recipe I omit sugars altogether because we like it more tangy than sweet. Nice dish to wrap up another uneventful week.
