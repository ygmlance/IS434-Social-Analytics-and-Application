My IG feed and stories were full of the normal family photos that you’d expect on first day of Eid, and also the new normal of family and friends on zoom sessions, whatsApp calls... Today, we “raya” in the comfort of our own homes.⁣

Truly, what seems to us as bitter trials, may in fact, be blessings in disguise...⁣

Selamat Hari Raya, Maaf Zahir dan Batin...
