Digging into a homemade poké bowl from @renztan on a hot & humid weekend. Gotta say, that chili padi in the seasoning really hit the spot! Wooooh! 
Thank you for feeding me #rendlrental 🧡 My belly is forever grateful! Not pictured here was the can of Tiger Beer that accompanied my delivery - saving that for tonight!
