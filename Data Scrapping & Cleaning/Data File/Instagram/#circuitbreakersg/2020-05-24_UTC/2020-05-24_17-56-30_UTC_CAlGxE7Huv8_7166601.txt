Behind the scenes of FLAT (Part I)
A film.
143 mins 
Year 2020. 
Strange times. 
Time of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A circuit breaker.
We are staying home. 
Some viewers were curious how FLAT was filmed. Was I with a crew? How can? It is the circuit breaker. No one should visit each other during the pandemic. 
Nope, I didn't break any rules. There was no crew in my house, not even the director Lei Yuan Bin who initiated the idea. 
I filmed myself alone using just my iPhone 8 plus, phone stands and improvised tripod, with director Lei giving instructions and suggestions on Facebook messenger. We didn't even voice call. 😅

We were exploring new ways of working, with the simplest means!

Here, I shared how I set up and positioned my phones for the various shots. After each shot, I sent the clips over to the director/editor. Each video was about 20-30 minutes long. The longest which my phone could take was 1 hr+. My poor phone fell a few times. Thankfully, it did its job well for the 13 days of shoot which began on Vesak Day 7 May 2020. 🙏🙏🙏 And I now understand it better.
