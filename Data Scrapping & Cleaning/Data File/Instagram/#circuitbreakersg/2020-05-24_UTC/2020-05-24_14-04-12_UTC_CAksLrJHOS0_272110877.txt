Day 46. Took photo of the morning sky from another angle.Becos it was more interesting than the usual view. ðŸ˜† Lunch - Teriyaki chicken donburi. Love how caramelisation worked. Tea - lemon pound cake with sugar glazed and candied lemon peel. Has been a while since I baked cakes. Quite a good zesty day for us. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #homebake #lemonpoundcake #instadaily
