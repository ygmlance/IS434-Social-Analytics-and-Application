The Circuit Breaker has allowed me time to learn a new skill; to record my voice and layer it with different vocal parts to create a one-man-Ferd-choir.  Hope to bless your Sunday with this rendition of Sing a New Song.  A big thanks to @collierquay for the beautiful piano accompaniment. #circuitbreakersg #newskills #stayhome #praisethelord #onemanchoir
