*DIY DUAL ♻️ SNACK BOX 🧩*
.
As I prepare for delivery in 4days time, I thought of putting together a surprise quiet time 📦 of simple fun plays for my firstborn based on his recent interests to keep him engaged (and close by the bed/sofa, if he wants to be near mama) when I nurse baby during confinement.

Sharing one of the low-prep play I prepared today that’s cost-free as it’s ♻️ puzzles made from three of Jasper’s favorite snack boxes. This 🧩 idea is adapted from his preschool‘s HBL activities but I did some addition by making it a dual side 🧩 - with the underside filled with simple math play for my number loving toddler. I’ve made the 3 puzzles in progression of 4,6,9 pieces and each explores a different early math concepts eg: Chinese numbers match with one-to-one correspondence, number in words form and domino-like play of simple addition, a concept we’ve been exploring recently on 👦🏻’s request.

Snack boxes are so colourful and they contain words, numbers, units which can enrich a child’s learning through play. Can’t wait to see Jasper’s reaction when he plays with these 3 DIY puzzles.
