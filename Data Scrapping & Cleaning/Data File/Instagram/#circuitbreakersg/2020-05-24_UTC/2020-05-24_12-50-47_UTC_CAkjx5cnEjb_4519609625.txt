In unique ways, I felt this shot resonated the ongoing Covid situation. Specifically the silver lining of this pandemic. Covid has stirred up the globe and in its wake, deaths, economic strain and closer to hearts, WFH schedules and disrupted travel plans. Nevertheless, it has outlined one crucial takeaway for us: our vulnerable social interaction. Something we have all taken for granted; queuing for a table, traffic jam, a crowded bus don’t seem as detestable now. When (if) this pandemic finally ends, I hope we will look back and remember this period not as the ‘shiok WFH’ or ‘NTUC Hunger Games’ season but as an unprecedented moment where humanity is humbled and society norms were challenged. Next time a sweaty panting jogger comes by to share a bench in the park, be mindful how such simple moments should be appreciated. Like it or not, Covid has taken the blindfold off most of us and as my Enciks like to say, this (person to person interaction) is not so much an entitlement anymore.. its a privilege.
