A traditional breakfast of Char Bee Hoon and Ngoh Hiang.
.
I use to love having this on Sunday mornings when the hubs would return from dropping Mini-me for catechism. We havenâ€™t had any since the #circuitbreakersg and seeing this appear on many local IGers post, I decided to make my own.
.
In times like this, you appreciate the delicious simple traditional delights that we never really think twice about. It makes you look at things we took for granted in a whole new light. .
