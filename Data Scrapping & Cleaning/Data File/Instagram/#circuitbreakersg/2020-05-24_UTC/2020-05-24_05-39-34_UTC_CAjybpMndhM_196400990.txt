Brunch today, was another Fried Rice made with ingredients thrown together from bits and pieces of what’s left in the fridge. Last night’s leftover Hot & Spicy Bratwurst was chopped and together with minced garlic and sliced chilli were sweat in butter till fragrant. Beaten eggs were added, and when nearly set, refrigerated leftover rice from Friday was added and mixed well. Sliced round cabbage, bean sprouts and chopped Kai Lan, or Chinese Kale was added along with several dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and everything was mixed well over high heat. Finally, cubed tomatoes, a liberal sprinkling of freshly ground white pepper and a knob of butter was added, and folded into the fried rice. Tasty and satisfying! #friedrice #sausagefriedrice #butterfriedrice #friedriceparadise #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #sundaybrunch #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
