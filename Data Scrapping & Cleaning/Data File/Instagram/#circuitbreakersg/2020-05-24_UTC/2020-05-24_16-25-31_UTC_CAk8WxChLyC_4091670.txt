Selamat Hari Raya to all! After 30 days of fasting, it feels abit odd to be having lunch again... and here’s mine — roti kirai/jala eaten with ayam masak merah & some serunding. Not very typical hari raya fare but circumstances this year aren’t very typical anyway... #eidmubarak2020 #foodstagram #harirayafood #circuitbreakersg #maafzahirbatin
