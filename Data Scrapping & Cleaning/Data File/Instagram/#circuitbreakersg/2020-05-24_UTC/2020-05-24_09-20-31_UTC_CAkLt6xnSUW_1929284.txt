CB 48 of 56. Today’s quick home-cooked meal : Spinach and Cheese Ravioli (bought from the supermarket ) with “anyhow” mixed pasta sauce and Tomato paste , with chicken minced meat ( and throw in the remaining broccoli). As I have to WFH even after the CB ends,  it’s gonna be more challenging for me day by to to keep up with the “different dish daily” cooking.... #ravioli #homecooked #homecookedmeal  #cbday48 #circuitbreakersg #anyhowcook #DifferentDishDaily
