I got a little preoccupied on Friday with the cinnamon rolls and forgot to talk about the deliciousness that was the veggie lasagne made with spinach, kale and pumpkin, and we also had the white asparagus with smoked salmon (@thelokalsingapore I still can't pronounce it!!). Fridays is our meat-free days and I wanted to try something that was different to our usual, and totally glad we had these two!
