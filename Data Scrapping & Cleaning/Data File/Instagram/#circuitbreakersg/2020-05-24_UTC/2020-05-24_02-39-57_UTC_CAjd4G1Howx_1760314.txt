Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri. 
Let not CCB spoil the spirits of this big day, my friends. It is through circumstances that our resilience and compassion grows. I look forward to the day we celebrate festivals like the good old days again!

Havenâ€™t been out for 2 months now. Thatâ€™s the only photo i can offer! ðŸ˜‚ NTUC playing Raya music is also the closest thing to the festive mood now!
