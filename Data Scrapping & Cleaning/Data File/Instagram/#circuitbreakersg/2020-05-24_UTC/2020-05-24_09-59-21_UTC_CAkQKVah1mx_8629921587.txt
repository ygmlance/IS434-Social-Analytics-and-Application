Eid Mubarak! Selamat Hari Raya! Salam Aidilfitri!⁣
⁣
Whether your celebration calls for Briyani, Rendang, or something else, we’d like to wish you lots of blessings on this day of celebration over your triumph.⁣
⁣
We’d like to take this opportunity to seek your forgiveness for any shortcomings you may have had to endure. Our team thanks you for your incredible support despite any challenges we faced during the CB and are extremely humbled to have a seat at your dining table during this trying period. We’re glad to be able to offer you some respite and it was an absolute joy to witness your Masterchef-worthy creations. You inspire us to continue to work hard to bring in more quality offerings to further fuel your passion.⁣
⁣
Have a beautiful celebration and a wonderful long weekend (not working, we hope). We’re going to be catching up on some much needed zzzs and stuffing ourselves silly and we’ll meat you again on Wednesday!⁣
