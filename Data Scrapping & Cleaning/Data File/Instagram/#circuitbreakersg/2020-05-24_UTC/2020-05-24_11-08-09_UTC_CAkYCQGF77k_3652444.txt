Muah Chee
A simple sweet #snack made with #glutinous rice dough coated with a mixture of grounded #peanuts and #sugar. You can buy #muahchee from pushcart vendors, or on trips to the pasar malam. Since it is one of my eldest daughter’s favourite snacks and she can’t go out to buy during #circuitbreakersg , I decided to make some for her. 💝
