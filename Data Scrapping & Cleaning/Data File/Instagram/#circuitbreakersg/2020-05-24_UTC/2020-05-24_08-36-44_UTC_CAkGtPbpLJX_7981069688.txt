Oscar Peterson Trio - Nigerian Marketplace, 1981. Oscar Peterson recorded for 2 major labels in his long career; Verve and Pablo. Verve captured much of his work in the 50s-60s and Pablo his later years. An amazing jazz pianist and composer, OP worked with the who’s who in jazz. This live record was recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1981 and with Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock in the audience, inspired OP to give a magnificent performance. Beautiful record to explore if you haven’t yet.  #oscarpeterson #oscarpetersontrio #nigerianmarketplace #nielshenningørstedpedersen #terryclark #pablorecords
