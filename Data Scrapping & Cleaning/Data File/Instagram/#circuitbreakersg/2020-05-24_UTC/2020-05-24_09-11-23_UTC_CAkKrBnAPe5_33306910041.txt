On 24-May-2020, our children had a meal accompanied by a "panda" munching on a bamboo, thanks to google (search #panda, click "Overview" tab, then "view in 3D space"). Our P1 son who dreams for #smokefreeSG counts panda as one of his favorite animals*. In 2019, our children visited #RiverSafariSingapore @riversafari.sg and #SingaporeZoo @singaporezoo.sg of @wrs.ig, each for more than once and our children were very delighted. Last year, I also planned to bring my little daughter to visit #JurongBirdPark @jurongbirdpark.sg last month (it was supposed to be her first visit there), but we had to postpone it. In 2014, our son had the blessing to visit Jurong #birdpark with his grandparents (including my late father who passed away from lung cancer in spite of having never smoked). Our children's lunch today was interrupted by #secondhandsmoke that entered our HDB home, I just opened our main door to air our home before we started our lunch. Help! I have written to MPs, Town Council, NEA #NationalEnvironmentAgency @nea_sg and the list goes on, but we are still suffering from #passivesmoking everyday. I tried to distract my children who were affected by second hand smoke this noon, to imagine their future visits to zoo, to be thankful for their past visits to zoo and #ThankYouZookeepers for keeping animals safe in this #covid19 pandemic. #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe #staysafe #StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious #TobaccoExposed #WorldNoTobaccoDay https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
