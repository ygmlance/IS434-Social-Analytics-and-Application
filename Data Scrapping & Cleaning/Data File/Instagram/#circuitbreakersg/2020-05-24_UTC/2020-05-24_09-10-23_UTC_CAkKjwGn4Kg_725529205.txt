Avocado 🥑 juice 🥤 (24/5)

The avocado fruit was soft on the outside but hard inside, how to eat? So decided to make the juice, with coconut water and a little fresh milk added, little salt and some honey for sweetness. Then all mixed up in a blender. Turned out to be quite juicy!  Perfect 👌 for a Sunday morning drink 😊
