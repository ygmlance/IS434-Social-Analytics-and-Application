Day 48 circuit breaker thoughts:

The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you. Don't go back to sleep.
- Rumi

I thought to myself, what do I want?
The pain of growth or the pain of staying where I am?
So, grow I shall.
What's going to help me grow?
The choice that scares me most.

Holly molly! June is 1 week away, is that not crazy to you?
Eid Mubarak beautiful people!
May you have a wonderful long weekend! ✨✨✨
