👫 TEAMWORK 👫
Teamwork 👫 helps our little ones develop empathy. It is an essential skill ✔️ for our little ones to thrive in an all-about-me world 🌎. There are times where our little ones easily display teamwork 👫 and there are also times where they prefer exploring things on their own especially when it’s something new. HuHa explored something new today - cutting 🔪 of garlic and frying ginger. I deliberately placed one chair and both were eager to jump on it and fry the ginger. There was initial struggle between them but once they realise that things won’t get done that way, they surprised 😮 me with their no-communication-needed teamwork. They spontaneously put on their gloves 🧤, resumed their cooking duties and supported each other. Voila for the au naturel teamwork ❤️❤️
.

Happy discovering the au naturel teamwork in your little ones too everyone 💕
