Think during this #circuitbreakersg I have became like my dinner. #soft #tofu #sundubujjigae Stock was #kimchi #onions and #chickenstock Tried out the #frozen #flowerclams from ntuc and was in for a surprising treat. Not too shabby indeed. Added #mincepork #silkentofu and some #prawns and not forgetting the cracked #egg in the stew. Great pairing with white rice and #grilledsabafish #鯖 鱼 #鯖の塩焼き
