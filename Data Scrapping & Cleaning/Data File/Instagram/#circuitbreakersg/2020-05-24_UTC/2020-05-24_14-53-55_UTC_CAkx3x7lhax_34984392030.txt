🔤Alphabet Fun🌟
.
.
J has recently entered a language sensitive period - he picks up words really fast and is able to construct more complex phrases. He has also started to show interest in the alphabet, so I decided to start exposing him to some letters. What better way to begin than with the letters of his name! 🌝
.
.
I used recycled flip caps from wet wipe packets. Since we use lower case letters most of the time, I started with lower case and wrote one letter on each cap. Then, when the cap is flipped open, a drawing of an object starting with that letter is revealed! 💥

J loves this activity as he enjoys opening and closing the caps, and hearing the ‘click’ sounds. He can also remember some letters now! 💫

Skills developed: Language, association, hearing, psychomotor skills and many more!

What are some ways you have introduced the alphabet to your child? 🌈
