Salam Eid Mubarak to all my Muslim brothers and sisters!
Celebrating a little differently this year! So I thought I want to start this #StayHomeRayaChallenge for ANYONE who are just up for some fun!
•
You know last year was a different beat so this is it!
•
Tagging some of you to kickstart the challenge. Wear your Eid outfits and just do YOU. Hope y’all are down for this.
