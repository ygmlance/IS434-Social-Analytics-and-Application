Given the current pandemic, it will probably be some time before we can visit HK again. Glad that we can now access to Áø†Âçé, one of their popular cha chaan teng here in S‚Äôpore. 
Featured here is the beef brisket curry and crispy bun with condensed milk that we ordered for lunch today, among other dishes. A good deal as they are offering 20% discount across all their items for pickup. Food was still warm when we reached home and tasted as good as those that we had in HKüòä
