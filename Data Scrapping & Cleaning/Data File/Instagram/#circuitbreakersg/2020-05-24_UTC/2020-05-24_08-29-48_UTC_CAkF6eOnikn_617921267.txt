Nasi Lemak. One of my Favourite Lunch Fix from Novena Square 2.

anytime to the other Nasi Lemak Brand C.
. 
Their Coconut Rice is full of Fragrance of the Lemak. The chilli is a tad sweet but very palatible when mixed with the rice and the side dishes. And I love their Fried Mash Potato Ball. And their Stir Fry Long Bean with Bean Curd. And their Beef RendangðŸ˜‹. Salivashun Mode On!
