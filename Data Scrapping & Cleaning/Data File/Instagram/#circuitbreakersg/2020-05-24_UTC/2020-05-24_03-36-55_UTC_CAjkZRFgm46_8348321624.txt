We used to order a plate of fried bee hoon to share and a small bowl of porridge each, for our breakfast but no more such days with hubby. I saw some pork shabu and frozen diced cauliflower inside e fridge so I decided to make a portion of porridge for myself. Added dried scallops into it, cracked an egg and garnished with the greens, liquid aminos, sesame oil, white pepper + 🌶️🌶️🌶️. All in 1 pot, 很好吃! ⁣
