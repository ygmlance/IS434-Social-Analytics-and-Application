This weekend's bake was an earl grey chiffon cake! I am seriously hoping this is tasty and enough flavour. Gonna await the feedback. 
I heated milk with the tea bags' leaves and let them sit for 5 to 10 minutes and sieved them out. Then in the cake itself I added more tea leaves! 
The cakes today turned out from the baking tin very cleanly it was so satisfying having that happen. 😍

Hopefully I've grasped the state of the meringue this time!!
