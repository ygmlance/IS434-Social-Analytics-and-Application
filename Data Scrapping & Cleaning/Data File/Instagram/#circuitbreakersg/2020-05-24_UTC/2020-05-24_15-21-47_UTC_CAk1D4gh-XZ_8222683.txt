A recycled jubah from Madinah, food cooked from scratch on our own and a no visitor policy are the main highlights for this year’s #covEID Raya. No complains about this very moderate Raya though. To me it makes us miss our love ones more and make us appreciate the true meaning of Syawal. Before the day ends, I would just like to wish my Muslim family and friends a blessed Eid. Stay home, stay safe & take care♥️
