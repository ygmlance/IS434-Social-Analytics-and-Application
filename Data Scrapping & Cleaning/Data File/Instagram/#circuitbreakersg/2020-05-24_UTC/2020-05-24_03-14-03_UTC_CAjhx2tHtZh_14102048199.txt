A fun, simple workout idea I conceived for kids to try at home. Great for training their motor skills (throwing, aiming), fine motor skill (hand grip) and with some aerobic exercise weaved in as well :)
.
1. Hang a velcro target board on the wall. 
2. On a sheet of drawing block, outline a drawing (of something they like). Fill in the areas with numbers that correspond to the target board.
3. Pass each of your kids a velcro-lined ball and your drawing.
4. Kids take turns to throw at the target.
5. On the drawing, kids colour the numbered area that they just scored.
6. Watch them go crazy as they try to complete their colouring!

Some affordable materials I found locally are from @toysrus_sg (target board with three balls), @decathlonsg (pack of six velcro balls), and @popular_sg (drawing block). Have fun!
