; {Circuit Breaker Day 48}

First time dabbling with rye flour. Been reading up a bit more on it, and learnt how it’s so dense, how the dough will be sticky, and how some 100% rye breads can take up to 24 hours to proof.

I followed @kingarthurflour recipe for their pumpernickel boule, but sub with dark rye flour instead. Also had 1 additional tbsp of plain flour because it didn’t seem to be coming together at all. I used my pizza stone for this.

I love how the bread has a lovely crust outside, but soft and chewy inside, with big airy pockets.

Things to improve on (see the last ugly photo): 1) shaping the dough to increase its tension cause I’m so bad at dealing with high hydration doughs, 2) slashing/scoring the dough to do deeper and cleaner cuts, 3) don’t even use any additional flour during the kneading and shaping, and lastly 4) transferring from shaping to the pizza stone nicely for final proofing.

This was pretty fun, I’ll definitely do it again.
