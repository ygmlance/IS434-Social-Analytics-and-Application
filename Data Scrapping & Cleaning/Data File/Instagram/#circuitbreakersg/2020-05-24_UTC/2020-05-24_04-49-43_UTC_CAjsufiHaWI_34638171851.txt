[Kopi Fellas]
.
Got my breakfast delivered from @kopifellas which was highly raved by many online and there was no delivery slots the next day but only 2 days later. That’s how popular that are haha. Their delivery fees are $5 per order which i found to be pretty reasonable for islandwide orders!
.
Matcha Toast Premium Set ($5.10): This set cames with 2 half-boiled eggs, 4 slices of matcha toast and a cup of coffee. I found that the matcha spread had no taste at all; no matcha taste or sweetness. Could only taste the bread 😓 The eggs were also too waterry to my liking. However to compensate for that, their black coffee was pretty good! .
Lor Mee ($4.30): There weren’t much ingredients inside and the gravy wasn’t fantastic. I’ve tasted better ones but i got to say that it’s just a pretty mediocre bowl of lor mee.
.
Laksa ($4.30): Again, there wasn’t much ingredients inside for the price i’m paying and the soup was a little rundown. It was a average bowl of laksa and it can’t be compared to the great ones I’ve eaten 😅
.
Minced Meat Noodle ($4.30): This was the best dish out of all that I’ve ordered. The serving of the meat was generous and the texture of the noodle was springy and i really liked the meatball! .
