🚴🏻‍♀️ HA's FIRST 🚴🏻‍♀️
Healthy body, healthy mind 🧠.
I try to keep their minds 🧠 engaged with activities while we #stayhome but it is equally important for them to #stayactive as well. 
Cycling 🚲 helps them 👫 to do just that. Ha has always been comfortable with her orange bike 🚲 but today she initiated her maiden ride on her two-wheeled bike and we loved every moment of her precious efforts 💕 
It was also interesting to observe what goes on in a child’s mind 🧠. Ha removed her trousers👖because she felt that it was obstructing her movements. But once she got the hang of manoeuvring the bike 🚲, she discovered that it wasn’t a hindrance anymore and put it back on 💕
