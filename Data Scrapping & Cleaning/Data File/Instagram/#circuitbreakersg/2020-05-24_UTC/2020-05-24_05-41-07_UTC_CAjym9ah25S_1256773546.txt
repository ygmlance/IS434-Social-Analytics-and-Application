We were supposed to be in Korea rn if not because of covid. So as a responsible humanbeing, we celebrated at home. Ordered the food from the Basque Kitchen and we were satisfied. 
C wanted to buy a cake too and decided to buy the tissue roll cake from bread talk to commemorate this special period. 
Look at picture #3 for ads, and picture #4 for reality ðŸ¤£.
The cake is nice though, despite its appearance ðŸ˜†
