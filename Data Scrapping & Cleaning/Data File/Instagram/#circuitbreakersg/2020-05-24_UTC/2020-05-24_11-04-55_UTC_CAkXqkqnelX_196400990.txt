My Hari Raya dinner this evening, was a Beef Rendang which had started its cooking journey on Wednesday, and was completed today after defrosting and simmering for another hour, to morph from being a gulai into its current state of being a rendang, with its gravy reduced and evaporated, and the coconut oil broken from the coconut cream. Accompanying it, was the most basic form of Sayur Kobis Goreng, or Stir-fried Cabbage, which had minced garlic, sliced onions and sliced red chillies which were sweat until fragrant, before strip sliced cabbage was added and itâ€™s seasoning of a swirl of light soya sauce squirted into the wok. These were served with an impromptu rendition of Nasi Minyak, or Scented Rice, which was cooked with butter, cloves, cinnamon stick, star anise and kaffir lime leaves. I didnâ€™t use enough butter, and didnâ€™t add any salt, so it was rather pale, and a little bland. Overall, dinner was tasty, and satisfying. ðŸ˜‹ #beefrendang #sayurkobisgoreng #nasiminyak #harirayadinner #malayfood #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg #selamatharirayaaidilfitri
