Eid in the midst of Covid.

Hari Raya's a little different this year. As we stay safe, I remind myself to be kinder to all in this trying time. 🙏🏻🕌☪️

Sending everyone warmest wishes & may we all see each other once this pandemic subsides. Pray things normalise soon, god willing. Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri. Maaf zahir & batin. 🌙♥️🙇🏻‍♂️

In true recession-realness style this Raya, I'm re-wearing a custom @ezuwanismail piece from 2015 sitting in my closet. Pairing with dad's kain samping from the 80s! Giving you some good ol' archival throwback. 🟩🟫⬛️

We're still in 'circuit breaker' period here in the +65. So with nowhere to go; I'd be staying home munching on pineapple tarts & sipping boxed iced tea. 🍍🧃👄
