Day 48 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (24 May 2020) - #nofilter #homecooked #dinnerforone using the last of the #leftover #noodles and fishcake from the previous #charkwayteow adventures on Day 44 and Day 46; doing my obviously not authentic version of #meegoreng - Doesn't look that great and definitely needs a bit more kick but so #yummy ! It looks too much like #charkwayteow though, probably thanks to the fishcake. ðŸ˜† #stayhomestaysafe #homecooking
