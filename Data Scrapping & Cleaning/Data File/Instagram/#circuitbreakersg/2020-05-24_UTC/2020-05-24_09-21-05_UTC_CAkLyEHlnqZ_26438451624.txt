Circuit Breaker Day 48 - we can never resist Indian Food! Ordered in the popular #thebananaleafapolo. Curry fish head is delectable and the fish is fleshy. After meal dessert- chendol and tau suan... something we took for granted in the past but now considered as delicacies! Sunday is a good day! #indianfoodsg #chendol #tausuan #stayhome #stayhomedelivery #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #comfortfood #fatdieme #yummy #enjoythemoment #superyummy #food #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #foodstagram #sgfood #foodsg #eatinginsingapore #sgfooddiary #sgfoodlover #sgfoodheaven #foodie #foodlovers #吃是福 #eatingisabliss #happyfood #thankgodforthefood
