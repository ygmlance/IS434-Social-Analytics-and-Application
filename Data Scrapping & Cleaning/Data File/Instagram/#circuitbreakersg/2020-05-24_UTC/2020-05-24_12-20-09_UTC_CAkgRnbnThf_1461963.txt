Day 48 of CB - @iankookinyen made tenderloin with some grilled vegetables and rice. Poured a little homemade teriyaki sauce to flavor everything. It’s such a simple sauce to put together there’s really no reason for anyone to buy the unhealthy bottled stuff. #homecooked #umamilicious #circuitbreakersg
