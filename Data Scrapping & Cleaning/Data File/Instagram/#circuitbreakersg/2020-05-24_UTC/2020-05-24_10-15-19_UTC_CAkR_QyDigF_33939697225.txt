~ Bulgogi Meatloaf Sandwich ~ 
The elder Simlet asked for a BIG purple sandwich today. So I made this bulgogi meatloaf sandwich with purple wheat bread and airfried purple sweet potato fries. When she saw it, she went "SO BIG! But I LOVE IT"! Lol. Our version is loaded with spices, normal thick toast and a layer of kimchi. It smells so good! #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #healthykidsfood #instafood #bulgogi #meatloaf #sandwich #koreanfood #fusionfood #bonappetitmag #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
