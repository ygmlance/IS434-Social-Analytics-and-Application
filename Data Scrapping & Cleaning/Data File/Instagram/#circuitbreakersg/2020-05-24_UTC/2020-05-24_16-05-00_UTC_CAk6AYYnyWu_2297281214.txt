Didn't have much time to cook anything nutritious tonight and since @iamivanlau loves his KFC, I decided I was going to make the Japanese Devil Cooked Rice with leftover KFC chicken and lechon... Thanks for the inspiration @mimimart and @da_feiji!
How to make:
- wash about 2 cups of rice in rice cooker pot
- the actual recipe calls for chicken stock and I had none so I added water the Asian way.  Asians will know exactly what I mean. We are taught to measure how much water is needed to cook rice by making sure the rice under the water is level and dip your index finger in so that the tip is touching the surface of the¬†rice.  Check that the water level is at the first crease (or knuckle) closest to your finger tip.  For those who didn't know this little hack, you're welcome üòò
- as I had no chicken stock, I added two bottles of Brand's chicken essence
- add two tablespoons of Tamari (soy sauce is fine too)
- finally add the KFC chicken on top of the rice.  I added some lechon, nuggets and chicken tenders I had leftover too
- close the lid and cook
- turn on some George Michael and come back about 30-40 minutes later when the rice cooker beeps
- break up the chicken, pull out the bones and mix the rice
- the recipe calls for some salt but I didn't think it needed any
- finally I heated up the leftover mashed potato and gravy and added a spoonful with cracked pepper on top of the rice for some next level Devil Cooked Rice!  Enjoy! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
