🍛CB Day48 - Dinner Time🍛
.
Japanese Day for our 2 meals today!
.
Made omu rice in a lazy way... ... Whahha!
.
Cook the rice in rice cooker, once done pour in a can of tomato tuna and stir, close the lid and rest.
.
Beat an egg and make an omelette to cover over the flavored rice. That's easy peasy!
.
Japanese curry is even easier, was forced to be lazy. The curry cubes is all sold out again in the supermarket, left with the precooked packet of Japanese curry. Bought it, dump the pack into boiling water for 5mins, open and pour over the rice! Super lazy method! FYI: the pack comes with potatoes and carrots inside.
.
Chicken breast is by #sadia frozen grilled black pepper chicken breast. Dump into the microwave for 4mins... *Poof* Done, eat!
.
I'm so proud of my lazy meals! Nice to see, Good to eat! 🙊🤤🙊🤤🙊🤤
.
Today dinner is also Meaty Monster Approved👍
.
Oh! Forgotten to make it Japanese enough, I made asari clam soup! 2 tbsp of miso into boiling water, dump cube tofu, shimeiji mushroom & asari clams into the pot! *magic* ✈️Flew to Japan✈️ in mins!
