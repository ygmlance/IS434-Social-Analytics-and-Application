Day 48 of #CircuitBreakerSg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We weren’t planning on ordering delivery today but our chicken had not defrosted in time for dinner, so....
.
The husband said he wanted something crispy so we decided to go for a good friend’s recommendation of pizza on the 2nd floor of Simpang Bedok hawker centre. Alas, when we googled, there are actually 2 pizza places and my friend was uncontactable.
.
Decided to just take a gamble and we ended up with @thenaughtychefsg. Must say it was a pretty good decision. Prices are very affordable. $14 for the Hawaiian and $20 for the Pulled Pork 12 inches. Although pizzas arrived half an hour late (they did call to tell us), pizzas were still quite warm.  You would think these are too much for 2 adults and 1 child but guess what, we polished off all except for 2 remaining slices.
.
Call in and order direct. Apparently it’s cheaper than the delivery platforms, per what the outlet told us.
.
Fun fact. The last time I called for pizza delivery was when I was studying overseas!
