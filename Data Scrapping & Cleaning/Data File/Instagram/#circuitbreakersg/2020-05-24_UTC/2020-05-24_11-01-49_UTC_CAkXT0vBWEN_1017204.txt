Salam Lebaran! Maaf zahir dan batin from our incredibly loud and energetic family (to be clear, I’m only describing the kids). I think I owe my neighbours some green packets. Filled with ear plugs. 😅 ⁣
⁣⁣I haven’t replied to the many, many messages (SORRY!) but know that I am feeling the love and shootin them back at ya with rays of positivity and blessings (though I won’t lie, tears were shed this morn cos I couldn’t fit in last year’s baju. 😫). ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Though it may be a sorta-shitty Raya because I’m missing the extended family and general buzz of the day, I’m grateful for so many things, Alhamdulillah. Thank you for being a part of that. ❤️ ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
May your days be filled with much layers of excitement like the Rendang, sweetness like the Honey Cornflake cookies, richness like the Kueh Tart and comfort like the good ol’ Serunding. ⁣⁣

p.s. that last pic is a re-enactment of our faces when we heard we’ll be Raya-ing at home. @renga21 is secretly happy to sleep in 😂.⁣
