Selamat Hari Raya Everyone!

We know this year’s Raya celebrations is a little different but, we hope this video bring smiles to your faces! 😁

On behalf of Farid and myself, we do apologise for any shortcomings or wrongdoings. May we all come out of this pandemic soon! 💕

Lots of Love,
Farid and Nadiah
