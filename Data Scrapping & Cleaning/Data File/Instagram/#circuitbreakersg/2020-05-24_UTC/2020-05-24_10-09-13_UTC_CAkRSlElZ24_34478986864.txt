Today was "leftovers day" for dinner, but we still made sure to order something fresh. That meant #xiaolongbao and panfried dumplings from @jinghuaxiaochi on Neil Rd (a first for us), and spicy nuggets plus chicken cutlets from @mcdsg! ðŸ˜… The #guotie was really tasty, and the McD's chicken cutlet was just the right amount of spicy. Boy are we now feeling very ful(filled)! #sgfoodies #sgdelivery #sgeats #savefnbsg #circuitbreakersg #onemealaday #angmohasian
