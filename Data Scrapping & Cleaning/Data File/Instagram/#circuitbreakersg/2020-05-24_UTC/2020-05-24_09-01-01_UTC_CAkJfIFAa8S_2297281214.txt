Give it up for "circuit breaker" day 48!  Yaaaaaaaaaay! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🎉🎉🎉
And it's another his and hers lunch series... I can't tell you how much I love leftovers... Especially roast beef leftovers!  Made roast beef, tomato, cheese and Dijon mustard toasties... Used the culinary torch and gave the cheese a good burning for a nice "chao da" (burnt) flavour... Then whizzed up a banana mango smoothie for @iamivanlau and I enjoyed my @jjdrinks_sg no sugar added herbal tea with cream... Now, this is a good Sunday lunch... 😋❤️
