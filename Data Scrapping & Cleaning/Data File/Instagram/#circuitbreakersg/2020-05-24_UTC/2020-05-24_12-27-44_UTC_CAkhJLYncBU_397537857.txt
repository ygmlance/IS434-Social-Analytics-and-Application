#CircuitBreakerSG D-48

Another 3-dish dinner for tonight. Steamed our favourite Cod Fish é³•é±¼with Red Dates. Just rehydrate the red dates in hot water for 15 mins prior to steaming.

Next dish is Mapa Tofu cooked with 
spicy Doubanjiang. Goes so well with steamed hot rice.

Complete with a mandatory green; Bok Choy with homemade crispy Shallots.

Enjoy your #dinner & the long weekend ðŸ˜Š
