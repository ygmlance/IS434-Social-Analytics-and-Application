So, I’ve been wanting to make a life-sized dollhouse but I haven’t found enough motivation. Then my friend @chiamie inspired me with her amazing masterpiece (it’s awesome) so I thought I’d give it a go this long weekend.
.
Call it inexperience; but half an hour into things, I realized how tough it was to take on such a huge cardboard project.
.
I really wanted to give up after piecing a few pieces together (unsuccessfully). And I was running out of tape.
.
As I was about to call it a day, my little girl put together the scraps I amassed and thanked me for making her a castle. 🤷🏻‍♀️ There was really no proper structure to speak about, yet she looked so pleased as she lined the board around her.
.
“Thank you, Mama. Now, I have a castle!”
.
🌿 My heart melted.
.
I decided to go on and piece the boards till they vaguely resemble a tower. It really is far from perfect; but my kids, they were so delightful. They played like it was the best gift, and our home filled with laughter.
.
🌿And, I am putting this picture here on my grid. Because this imperfect structure (which is still very much loved by my kids) is a reminder for me that children need very few things to be happy.
.
🌿 That joy can be found in simple things, and it really is our love and presence that truly make these little hearts happy, secure and comforted.
