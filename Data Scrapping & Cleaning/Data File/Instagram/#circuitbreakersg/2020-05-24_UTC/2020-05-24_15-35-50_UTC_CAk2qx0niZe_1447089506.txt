🗽 New York Cheesecake 🧀 🍰 .
Initially I was apprehensive to try baking this. Baking a cake in a waterbath sounded intimidating 😖 But I’m glad I overcome my baking cheesecake fear (I was imagining water leakinh into my baking tin, cake got stuck on the tin, bottom layer biscuits collapes and all...) and decided to try this! Very happy with the outcome 😋
