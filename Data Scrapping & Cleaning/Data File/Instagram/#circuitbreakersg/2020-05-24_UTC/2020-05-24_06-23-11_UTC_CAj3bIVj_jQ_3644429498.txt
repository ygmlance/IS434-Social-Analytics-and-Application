Sourdough Potato Buns “kiap” with roast pork.  I layered the bun with roast pork, mustard sauce, romaine lettuce and cherry tomatoes. ⁣⁣

These soft potato buns are baked by @droolcookclub using natural yeast. And it is not sour at all!!! They are fantastic even on it own or slice it into half to spread with butter or layer it with any filling to create your own burgers! ⁣⁣

If you want some sourdough potato buns, DM @droolcookclub for order. She bakes rustic sourdough bread too! ⁣⁣
