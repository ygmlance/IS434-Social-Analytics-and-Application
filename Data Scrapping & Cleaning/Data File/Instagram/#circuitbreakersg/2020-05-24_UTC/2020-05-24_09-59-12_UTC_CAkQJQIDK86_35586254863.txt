Good friends are needed now more than ever, since we’re all stuck at home. Singaporeans are mostly quite chill so we’re lucky in that aspect I guess! Everyone I’ve met has been really kind and supportive of anyone. Guess that government propaganda in our textbooks about being kind to one another did work. Friends aren’t only for joking around with either! Real friends are those you can talk with even when you’re feeling like shit and don’t snake on you. Thus, a big thanks to @pornhub and @brazzersofficial for supporting me through this difficult time! Never could have made it without you :)
