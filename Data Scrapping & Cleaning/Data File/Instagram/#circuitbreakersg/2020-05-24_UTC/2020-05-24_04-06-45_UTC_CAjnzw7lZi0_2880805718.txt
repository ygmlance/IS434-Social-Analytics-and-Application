The beer that made me fall in love with beer üç∫
‚Å£
Like many men in Singapore, my experience with beer started with the ubiquitous Tiger during my National Service, which was available duty-free at the army mess. But the taste of hops is something acquired and back then I couldn't appreciate the bitterness of the brew.
‚Å£
When I became an army regular some years later and visited the mess again, I noticed that it sold the Guinness Foreign Extra alongside the Tiger, for half again as much as the latter cost. Intrigued, and remembering an episode when I was a young boy and one of my dad's beer-drinking friends tricked me into taking a sip of Guinness by telling me that it was Coke - my dad was in on the prank as well and laughed when he saw my expression thereafter - I decided to give it a shot.
‚Å£
My first impression of the Foreign Extra was of roasted, smoky flavours, which were not altogether unpleasant. With my improved beer-speak today I would say that its palpable hoppiness did not put me off, but served to balance its malt to yield "a powerful drink with a complex, fruity bittersweet flavour". I became so enamoured with the Foreign Extra that it was the beer I had the most of for a long period of time, before I discovered my love for tasting different beers from all around the world.

When I cracked open this can of Foreign Extra the other night, a bit of it spilled onto the side of the can during the pour. Not wanting to waste a single drop of this wonderful dark liquid I licked it up, and immediately thought that I had inadvertently consumed some cigarette ash that might have been left on the can, such was its smokiness. Only after I took a pull of the pint that I realised I had forgotten how intense this brew can be. And then I was happily reacquainted with its signature, bittersweet "full-bodied palate of roast".

I will always regard the Guinness Foreign Extra as my gateway to the world of beer. It was the first beer that I truly enjoyed, although it would not be the last. And once in awhile it's nice to drink a beer which evokes such fond sentiments that one's state of mind must surely act to enhance the taste. So this is my beer story. What's yours?
