Prepared this dessert yesterday afternoon ♥️ #mylunch 😋 The #peachgum was soaked the night before and the next day I hv to pick out the impurities from it (this is the process that puts me off at times 😜) but then after having done this a few times,it took me less than 15min to check the whole batch yesterday🤗 N I added papaya (for the first time , cos I happened to buy a papaya the day before )Well, it’s all worth the effort n I had another chilled version of this earlier on tonight after my ice- cream 😜
