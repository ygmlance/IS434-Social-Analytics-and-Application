@then_poh_loong is my ex-classmate since Secondary School. I always knew him as a florist but in 2007, Ivan 👨‍🍳 decided to establish @wangthaikitchen in the heartland of Singapore at Blk 92 Toa Payoh Lor 4.

Ivan is a self taught chef who goes to Bangkok regularly to sharpen his skill in making Thai cuisine. 😃 As humble as he always is, he told me that when he first ventured into the F&B business, he knew nothing about cooking but tried his best to learn from chefs in both Singapore and Thailand, coupled with his own R&D.

I know many businesses are affected by the Covid19 and so I decided to support Ivan by ordering this family set for my family. 💪🏻 The portion at @wangthaikitchen is extremely generous and super value for money.

Though one might find that the flavours are much milder than those in Thailand, they are made more attuned to our local palates. It works pretty well for my children and old folks. 😋 Furthermore, Ivan is always accommodative to any special request you may have. Although his kitchen is not 100% gluten free, he’s so kind to ensure that these dishes are free from soy and oyster sauce so that my kids can enjoy them too.

Do support our local business and contact @wangthaikitchen at 93847588! Ivan provides delivery islandwide at a small fees paid to the courier company. So you are helping not 1 but 2 businesses here. 👍🏻
