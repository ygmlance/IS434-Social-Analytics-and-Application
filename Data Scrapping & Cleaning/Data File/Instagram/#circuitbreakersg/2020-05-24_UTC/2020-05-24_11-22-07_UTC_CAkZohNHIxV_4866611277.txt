Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri ✨In these unconventional circumstances, celebrations may take a unique form this year. We hope you’re enjoying the festivities with friends and family via online video conferencing platforms, while keeping safe & healthy at home.

Despite these unusual times, we’re thankful to be blessed with good health and a supportive & loving community. We’d like to extend our appreciation for all delivery riders/drivers and F&B companies staying open and working hard to get all our yummy celebratory meals to us during this period.

Wishing all a lovely long weekend, from Pratique Bodyworks.
