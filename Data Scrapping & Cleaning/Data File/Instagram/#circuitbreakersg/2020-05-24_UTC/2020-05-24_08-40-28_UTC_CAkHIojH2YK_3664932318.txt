Thought we heard a lot of people saying "Eat Murtabak" this morning, so we quickly went over to Liang Seah Street to #supportlocal our neighbour @teh_tarik_time. Then we realized... oops! Never mind. Food is delicious. We are happy.

Here's wishing #eidmubarak and #selamathariraya to all our Muslim friends, and a happy #longweekend to everyone else!

Anyway, "Eid Mubarak" means "Blessed Feast" in Arabic, so we weren't too far off right? @guatksee
