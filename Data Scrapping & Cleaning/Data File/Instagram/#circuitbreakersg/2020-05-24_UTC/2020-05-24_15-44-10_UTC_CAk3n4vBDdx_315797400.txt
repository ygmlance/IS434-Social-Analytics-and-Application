Eid Mubarak to you, my family, friends and all my Muslim brothers and sisters wherever you are around the world. .
.
I pray Allah swt shower countless blessings upon you and your family. .
.
This year we celebrated Ramadan in a very special way. Itâ€™s a test from Allah swt on patience and faith for Prophet Muhammadâ€™s ummah. Alhamdullillah. .
.
Personally I am humbled by the whole experience and pray Allah swt Grant me patience and strength in everything I do.  Aamiin

Love, great home-cooked food, fresh flowers gifted by friends, seeking forgiveness from each other, giving zakat Raya still continue during these Circuit Breaker times.  We cannot meet, we cannot salam and hugs but we continue our silatulrahmi with video calls and Zoom meetings.  Zakat by e-gift or PayNow, right Singaporeans?  I am thankful and grateful, ya Rabb. .
