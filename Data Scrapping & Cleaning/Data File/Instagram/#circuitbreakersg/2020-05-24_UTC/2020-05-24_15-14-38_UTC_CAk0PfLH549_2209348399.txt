I’ve started a highlight of lockdown stories and was rewatching it the other day. I was particularly intrigued by the yoga time lapses I started recording (smth I was not sure should go public at first), and I started noticing my own mistakes and def saw how much I’ve improved over the course of the lockdown. In some parts - consciously, in others - unconsciously, and that was the most intriguing. I was grateful to myself for the decision to start recording those, as I clearly saw my own development - that’s gonna push me even more now. ⠀

It also led me to a thought of how it would be to have the same time lapse of thoughts and feelings, to see how they evolve, change and, more importantly, how you consciously become aware of mistakes and learn. Of course, we have it in our heads, but we don’t always realise conscious/unconscious parts of learnings, or, to be more precise, we don’t always have time and space or desire to go deeper. ⠀

I used to have a notebook (no, it didn’t start with ‘Dear John’ or ‘Dear diary’), and every time I go through the thoughts I put on paper some years ago, I’m fascinated! ⠀
