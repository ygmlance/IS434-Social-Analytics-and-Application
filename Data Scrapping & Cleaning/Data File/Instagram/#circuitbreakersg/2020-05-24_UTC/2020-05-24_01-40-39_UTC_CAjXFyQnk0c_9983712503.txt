𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗶 𝗥𝗮𝘆𝗮 𝗣𝘂𝗮𝘀𝗮 is an important religious festival celebrated by the Muslims in Singapore. This festival is marked as the end of Ramadan that is one month of fasting. While this year's Hari Raya will be different, as visiting & celebrating with families & friends will not be allowed, do continue to stay positive and leverage on technology to stay connected with loved ones! ❤️
.
Team Kiztopia wishes all our Muslim friends Selamat Hari Raya! May you and your loved ones be blessed with love, happines and health. Stay safe and stay well! 😊
