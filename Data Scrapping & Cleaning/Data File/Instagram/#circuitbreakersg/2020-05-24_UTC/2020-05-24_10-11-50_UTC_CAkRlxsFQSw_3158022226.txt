This pic is from last year Hariraya.For the past 10 yrs I have never cooked on this day as we will have our lunch with our neighbors. As much she loves the smell of my home #sambrani , I love her #briyani .( She reminds me to put #sambrani even if missðŸ˜€.)
Missing her food this year but wishes are always there..#safetyfirst
Also, #marakkama one disclaimer to all #igmaamiyaars - That briyani is vegetarian ðŸ˜‰ & cake #kulla egg is there ..
