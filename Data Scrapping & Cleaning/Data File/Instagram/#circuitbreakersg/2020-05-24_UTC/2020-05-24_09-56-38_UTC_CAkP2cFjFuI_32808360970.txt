Introducing #EntrepreneursToEveryone - our weekly IG interviews that show how creativity belongs to everyone. How it’s wielded by the pioneers of Singapore to create new ideas and new frontiers.⁣ ⁣
Kicking off the first in the series, we had the pleasure to talk to @jeffreykliu, CEO & Co-Founder of @jenficapital⁣
⁣
On the origins of Jenfi -⁣
“As the founder and CEO of GuavaPass, I spent many years working with small businesses such as fitness studios. They were constantly looking for ways to grow faster but struggled with having access to enough capital to succeed. It made me realize that there are limited effective means for a small business owner to scale. The goal for Jenfi is to be the de-facto option for businesses looking to grow by funding all their relevant marketing and growth expenses, such as digital marketing ads and other relevant growth spend. This translates to a positive return on spend, which leads to more sales and ultimately, increases the value of the overall business.”⁣
⁣
On how Jenfi is working through the crisis -⁣
“We’re currently working closely with our borrowers on strategies for them to recover their growth during this crisis. We believe there’s a lot of pent up demand for advertising and marketing once the current lockdown ends as businesses are hungry to run promotions to entice consumers to come back.”⁣
⁣
What’s next? -⁣
“We’re constantly focused on refining our financing product offering to better serve the needs of businesses. Our innovations have created more flexibilities for the business owner. For example, our variable repayment structure ties repayment to a small percentage of business sales so that we are aligned with the ebbs and flows of business performance. We plan to continue scaling our team and operations here in Singapore and will be planning for market expansion next year.”⁣
