After XO sauce I used dried scallop to make the superior sauce for this super fast Tofu Scallop dish. The sauce was of familiar flavour from zi char/Chinese restaurant dishes. What dried scallop could do to your dishes is a revelation to me. Never walking past dried scallop without looking at it. @spicenpans recipe #circuitbreakersg day32 #mylollybellykitchen #ibonappetit #quarantinecuisine #quarantineandcook #isocooking #isolationcooking #lockdowncooking
