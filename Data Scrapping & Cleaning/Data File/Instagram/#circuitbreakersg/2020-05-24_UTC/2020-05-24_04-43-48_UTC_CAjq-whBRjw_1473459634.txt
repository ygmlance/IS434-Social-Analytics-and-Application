Eid Mubarak everyone. K and I had the best Ramadhan this year, we manage to do our very best even with 2 kids. Amazing isn’t it. Syawal 2020, we are so grateful to be able to celebrate with our latest addition, another sweetheart of mine, Emre Mishary. Even with circuit breaker in place, insyallah the spirit of togetherness doesn’t die and we shall overcome the odds and the new normal with positivities ❤️ With all these challenges we are facing, please accept our apologies to all our family and friends if we intentionally or unintentionally hurt any of you. #syawal2020 #circuitbreakersg #coveid•

This year is all about being modest and to celebrate with what we have. Alhamdulilah.
