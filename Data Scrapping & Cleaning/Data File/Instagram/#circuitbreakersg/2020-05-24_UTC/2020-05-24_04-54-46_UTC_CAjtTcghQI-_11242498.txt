Selamat Hari Raya Eidulfitri
Minal 'aaidiin Wal Faaiziin Wal Maqbuulin
.
.
.

Minal 'aaidiin means may you be among the people who return to the normal routine. The reality of 'normal' is when we realize that we will only return to Allah. Only when we return to Allah, everything will be at ease and calm.
.
.
.

Wal faaiziin means may you also be among the successful people; successful in conquering your nafs that always wants you to do bad things instead. Success is when we acknowledge that being bad and abusive for example, will only tarnish our celebration.
.
.
.

Wal maqbuulin means may you also be among the people that get the acceptance from Allah. Acceptance of our routine that moulded our character in Ramadhan, acceptance of our realisation that Allah is the Greatest, acceptance from our perseverance with His orders and plans.
