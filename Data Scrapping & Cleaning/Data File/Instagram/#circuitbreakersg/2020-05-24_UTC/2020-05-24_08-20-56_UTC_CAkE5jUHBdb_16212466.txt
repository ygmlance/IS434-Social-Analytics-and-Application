My claypot rice lunch loaded with chicken, sliced unagi, tobiko, a raw egg and a side dish of curry cabbage.🤩🤩🤩 This is the first time I made this dish with unagi and the family loves it! 👍🏻👍🏻 ⁣

The combination of the flavour of unagi, the aroma of the smokey rice, the savoury taste of the marinated chicken and the crunchy texture of Tobiko made this lunch super satisfying! Yum!!😋😋😋⁣

The bottom layer of crusty rice was done just right without burning it. First, turn on the oven to 240℃. Cook the rice in the claypot over the stove. When it is about 80% dry, turn off the fire. Lay the ingredients on the rice. Cover the claypot and put it in the oven for 20 mins. Don't open the cover and return the claypot to the stove with max fire. Turn off the fire when smoke starts to seep out of the cover. Leave it for 2-3 mins to let the rice take it the smokey aroma. 😍
