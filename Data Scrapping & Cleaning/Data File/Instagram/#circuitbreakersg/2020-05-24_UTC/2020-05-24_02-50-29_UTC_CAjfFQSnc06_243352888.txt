Want your child entertained for 20-30 mins tomorrow? Join me for my first live storytelling tomorrow, Monday, 11am! 📚📖💬⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
I'll be reading two stories: How to Code a Sandcastle and The Gruffalo⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
🤖👧🏻🏖️I was drawn to the first story as I've been sprucing up my website and wanting to at least have a basic understanding of what CODING even means. I can now at least say I understand the concept with this story! 👩🏻‍💻⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
🦁🐻🐗The second book is a classic and one of the most popular workshops that I've conducted. Since those can't happen safely for a while, I want to share this online, so that Mouse and Gruffalo's adventures can still go on! 🐭🌳🙈⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Want to help? 👪 Tag a friend with young kiddos and set a reminder to join me on IG Live tomorrow 🎥 See you there! 😃⁠
