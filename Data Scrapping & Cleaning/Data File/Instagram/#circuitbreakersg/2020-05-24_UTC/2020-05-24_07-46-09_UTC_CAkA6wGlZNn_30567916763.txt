#circuitbreakersg day 48

Itâ€™s almost time for the next groceries run so I have very limited ingredients left in the fridge. Decided to make something simple for brunch and we ended up with some fluffy omelette. ðŸ˜ƒ

My first attempt making this dish many weeks ago was not successful as I didnâ€™t beat the egg whites long enough. .

Todayâ€™s attempt was much better.. except that omelette was fluffier when I was just done cooking it but I took a while to take the pictures so the egg sank a little.. ðŸ˜”

Interesting how we learn life lessons from cooking. I didnâ€™t have enough patience to beat the egg whites thoroughly the first time as I just wanted to get it over and done with quickly. As a result, the omelette didnâ€™t turn out fluffy. Because of my experience, I knew today that I needed to be patient in beating the egg whites and I was rewarded with much fluffier omelette than I had the first time. #gratitudediary
