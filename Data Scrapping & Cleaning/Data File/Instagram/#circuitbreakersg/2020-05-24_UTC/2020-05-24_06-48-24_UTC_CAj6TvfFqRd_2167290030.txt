DAY 47, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
(Countdown .... 9 days to go)
Spaghetti with Cordyceps

Tried cooking the beautiful looking fungus for the first time. It I always gives me a certain kind of  excitement to try something new. It looks like noodles, so thought it would be nice to pair it with something similar. SPAGHETTI !!
For those new to this fungus, its called Cordyceps Militaris, and is known to have quite a few health benefits and medicinal value.
So I made spaghetti in cream & cheese, along with some pork on the side. Cooked the pork in rum and paprika. 
As for the cordyceps, I saut√©d some garlic and onion in butter, and tossed it in. Seasoned it with dry Italian mixed spices. 
My gauge of success is the reaction I get from my boys. They liked it, so I guess it was good. 
Experiment successful!! .
