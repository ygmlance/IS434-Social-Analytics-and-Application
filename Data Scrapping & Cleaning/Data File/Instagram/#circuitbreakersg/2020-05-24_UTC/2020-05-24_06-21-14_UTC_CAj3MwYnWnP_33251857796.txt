How much ðŸ’° do you spend on recurring monthly subscriptions? ðŸ’¸

SmartyPence Tip ðŸ’¡
In such uncertain times, it's time to review what are the truly 'essential' subscriptions you need! Subscriptions are recurring & you get charged regardless of how much you actually use. They seem affordable but they ADD UP! $50 of monthly subscriptions  make up $600 a year. $600 saved & invested at 3% a year becomes $17,205 after 20 years!! ðŸ’°ðŸ’° . .
ðŸš¨ Do you really need multiple streaming platforms (AND Spotify) just to catch that 1 show? Perhaps time to review how time you're spending watching shows or keep to 1 platform at a time.
.
ðŸš¨ Fitness costs, YouTube channels like Pop Sugar Fitness help you to stay in shape with tons of celebrity fitness videos.
.
ðŸš¨ Subscription boxes, well, try taking a break & see if you can live without it.

Different people have different 'essentials', but chances are likely you have something that can be cut or consider sharing your account with your family & friends to save some extra $$. .
