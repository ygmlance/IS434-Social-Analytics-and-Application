Blessed, happy birthday @co_ng
.
It’s surreal to have a younger sister grow this big; not helped that you remain youthful looking (thanks to the Aussie slow life)
.
Your straight talking with #theAteamSim grounds them and when they grow big and can’t get through to me, my hope they run to you
:
Stay well, safe and secure in God’s love and goodness. You may be miles apart from us but always close as a heartbeat....
