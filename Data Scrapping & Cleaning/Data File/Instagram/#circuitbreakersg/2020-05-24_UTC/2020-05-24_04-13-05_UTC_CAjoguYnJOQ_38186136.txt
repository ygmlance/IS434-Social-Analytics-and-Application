Yays! Spotted a pair of hornbills while walking out to buy coffee. This is second time I've seen it around my area since few years ago. The first time I spotted, it was just one hornbill perched far on top of a lamp post. This time, they were so closed up and literally in my face! Great time to spot interesting nature.

There was once I saw a beautiful and colorful pink & yellow butterfly with square patterns on its wings, but I forgot to take a pic. Hopefully I'll get to spot it again! ðŸ¦‹ðŸ¦‹ðŸ¦‹
