the circuit breaker made me realise how bad I am at being with myself. I’ve been so used to going out for live music, being in crowds, senseless chatter and banter and just being with people in general that it’s a little awkward spending this much time alone. I suppose the 55% Introverted part of me is feeling really energised  and the 45% Extroverted side fees starved. In Lauv’s words “we love to get high but we don’t know how to come down”. Anyway, I’m squeezing in a cover of this very real song before I start preparing for the semi finals of @singforsg  Thank you @tspau for the song suggestion!
