These are my favourite shades of eco-cotton by @nurturingfibres. Soothing neutrals that convey a sense of calm. Really happy that I can resume operations in June - these few weeks have been spent in stocking up, tweaking the website, and improving my workflow so that I can manage my stock better and you can get your handmade pieces faster. Looking forward to re-opening! Shout-out to @yarning.hearts for my yarn supply and to @stitchedupcraft for the amazing pattern. .
