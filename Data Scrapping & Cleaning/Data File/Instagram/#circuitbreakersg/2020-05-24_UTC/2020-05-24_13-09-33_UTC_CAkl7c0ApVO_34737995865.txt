Roast pork, char siew and roast duck from Fook Kin. Ordered a vegetable dish to balance out the proteins and couldn’t resist their golden lotus root crisps too. I really liked that the sauce for the lotus root crisps was separated so the crisps were still very crispy when it arrived. The meats were all well roasted, especially the roast pork with its crackling skin and the char siew with the right proportion of meat & fats. Also, I enjoyed the different sauces meant for the different meats. The sauces were all on point! 👌🏻
