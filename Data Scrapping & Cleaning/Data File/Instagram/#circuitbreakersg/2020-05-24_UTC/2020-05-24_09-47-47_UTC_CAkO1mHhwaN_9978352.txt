For the good and not so good, this raya is definitely one to remember. Instead of making cookies and raya dishes to feed the guests coming over to our houses, we made them to give them away to families and friends. Instead of going out for visits, we are staying indoors with our same household family, cats and Netflix. Instead of looking forward to meeting and hugging our family members, you look forward to the family zoom meetings and even spent time and effort looking good for it. 
Nonetheless everything happens for a reason, and as much as we miss our family, we pray that Allah will always protect them from any harm insyaallah. Till the day we meet again, please take good care ❤️
