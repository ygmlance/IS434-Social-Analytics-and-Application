Wishing all Muslims a joyous celebration! Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri!
Have a wonderful time celebrating with your loved ones, or virtually celebrate with family and friends with a group video-call to catch-up and keep each other company.

Of course, no Hari Raya celebration is complete without kuih and biscuits - but remember to enjoy them in moderation! ðŸ˜‰
