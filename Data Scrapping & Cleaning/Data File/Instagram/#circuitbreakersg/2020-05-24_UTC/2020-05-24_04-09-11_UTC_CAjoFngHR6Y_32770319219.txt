This season is especially momentous. It marks both the start of the Hari Raya celebrations for our Muslim family and friends as well as the last week of the official “circuit breaker”.

SEASON 7 of our Singapore virtual arts festival is here >>> link in bio (@apart.sg)
.
We have struggled, endured, and persevered; some more than others, some longer than others, and yet it is not the end of the tunnel. There is still work to be done. Nevertheless, let’s treasure the progress we have made, the bonds we have strengthened, and the bridges we have built, because what we’ve achieved so far is also no small feat.
.
And as we revel and rejoice, let’s be mindful not to lose what we have gained. Enjoy the brilliant line-up of art we all deserve in Season 7, and Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
