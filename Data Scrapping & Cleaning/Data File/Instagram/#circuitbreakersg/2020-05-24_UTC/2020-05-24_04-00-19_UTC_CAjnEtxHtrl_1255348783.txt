Here's wishing all a Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri! ðŸ’š You know you canâ€™t spell kuih without â€˜uâ€™ and â€˜iâ€™! Even as we embrace a different Hari Raya this year, may love, peace and forgiveness be magnified among us. Don't let the distance stop the celebration â€“ stay connected with your loved ones and indulge in your favourite Raya must-haves over video calls.

Remember to enjoy the festive goodies in moderation!
