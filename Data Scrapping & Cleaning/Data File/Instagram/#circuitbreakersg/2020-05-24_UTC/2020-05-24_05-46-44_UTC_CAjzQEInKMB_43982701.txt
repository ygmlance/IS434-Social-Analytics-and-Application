What’s for lunch on another #stayhomesg Sunday? For me it’s bak chor mee (minced pork noodles). Hot, comforting, with lots of liao, so shiok! #bakchormee #noodles #homecooking #singaporehomecooks #sgeats #sgfood #stfoodtrending #burpplesg #8dayseat #sghomecooking #circuitbreakersg #sgfoodies #feedfeed #f52grams #huffposttaste #buzzfeedfood #eattheworld #asianfood #foodstagram #beautifulcuisines #foodphotography #sgfooddiary #heresmyfood #delicious #foodiegram #foodsg #foodandwine #thekitchn #seriouseats
