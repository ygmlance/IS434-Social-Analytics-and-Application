Cir Breaker Day 48 Dinner.

I was doing grocery run nearby, so decided to pop by and order the herbal chicken leg 四味鸡 ($4.20) from He Jia Fu. Had it for dinner alone since lunch was really heavy.

The chicken leg was very big, but tender and juicy within. Loved the herbal sauce so much that I slurped up every bit of it. The stall owners sure weren't stingy with the herbs, thus rendering a deliciously sweet herby sauce that was not too strong or salty after steaming. 
Now if only I can replicate this at home... but at that price, methinks it is easier to just buy and support our local hawkers anyway
