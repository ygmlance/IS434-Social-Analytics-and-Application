This is a pop art that my teacher asked me to do during the HBL. ⁣
⁣
Is it nice? Got Andy Warhol feel? ⁣
⁣
If you are interested to know how I do this, below are the steps. ⁣
1️⃣ Get ready a A4 paper, colour pencils /crayons 🖍, glue and some recycled papers. ⁣
2️⃣ Draw your own self portrait on the A4 paper using either colour pencils or 🖍 or both.⁣
3️⃣ Tear the magazines /🗞 /brochures into small pieces. ⁣
4️⃣ Paste them on the surrounding of your self portrait. ⁣
5️⃣ Wait for it to dry and your artwork is done. ⁣
