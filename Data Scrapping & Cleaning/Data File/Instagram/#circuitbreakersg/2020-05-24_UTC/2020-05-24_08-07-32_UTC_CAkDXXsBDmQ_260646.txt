Eid Mubarak everyone! This year's Ramadan was really memorable. For me personally, other than #circuitbreakersg, it's a different one because its the first time we're celebrating without two of my grandmothers. This month, I also had the opportunity to work on a little fundraising project for @mtfa.sg, learn a little more about my own religion while also helping the underprivileged. Admittedly, at times we become too preoccupied about earning a living, building our careers that we forget the ones that may not be as fortunate as we are. Who knew what zakat was? And that there were 3 different types? Not me. I just took it for granted cos my dad has been paying it on my behalf all this years. Who knew the Malay Muslim Asatizah community in Singapore is soooo savvy? Who knew that there are so many influencers and content creators amongst them? Not me.

I'm so thankful for this month because I gained so much knowledge this month, probably more than i have in the last 1 year. What about you - how was your Ramadan? .
