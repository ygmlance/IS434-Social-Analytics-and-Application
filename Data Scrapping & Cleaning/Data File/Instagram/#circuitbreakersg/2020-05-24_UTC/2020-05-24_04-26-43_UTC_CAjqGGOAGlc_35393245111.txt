it’s a shokupan japanese white loaf again!!☺️ really love this soft, fluffy white loaf so much and can’t stop making it!!😆 used @bakewithpaws ‘s shokupan japanese soft white bread recipe and was very well received by the family!😝 today’s bread was enjoyed as kaya butter and butter sugar toast, together with soft boiled eggs, the ultimate singaporean breakfast combo!!👌🏻altered the baking time n temperature of the oven and am very pleased with the results😋
