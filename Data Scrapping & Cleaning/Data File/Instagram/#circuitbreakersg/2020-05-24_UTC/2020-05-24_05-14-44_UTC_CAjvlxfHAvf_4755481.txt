Lunch. Missing the truffle oil meepok from Imperial Treasure. Decided to make something to replicate the flavour. 
#fresheggnoodles dressed with #truffleoil #oystersauce and #soysauce with #panseared #chicken strips of #kingoystermushroom and #kailan 
Sprinkled with some #scallions and #crispyfriedlard 
Again chicken #fromthefreezer #mushrooms and #vegetables from the last #groceryrun 
#lard also from the last grocery run and rendered and jarred to add to random #chinesedishes 
I must say this virgin effort came out really well. When itâ€™s possible ima try this again with a bunch of different mushrooms.
