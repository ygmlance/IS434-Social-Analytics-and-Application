焖番茄🍅饭~ tomato rice in rice cooker~ simple & easy to prepare especially for work from home mum. You can add any of your favourite veggie in the rice, i cook the veggie separately and blend in the rice only when serve, because if too much veggie will soaked the rice become too soggy. #sgcooking #sghomecook #sgmum #sgtoddler #toddlerfoodideas #sgkidhomecook #kidhomecook #kidfoodideas #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #stayathomecovid19 #stayathomefood #stayhomewithascott
