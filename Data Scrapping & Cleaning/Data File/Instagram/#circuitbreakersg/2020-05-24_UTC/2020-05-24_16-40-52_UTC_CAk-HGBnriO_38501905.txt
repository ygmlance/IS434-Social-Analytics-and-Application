On days that hubby is tied down with work, I have to think of simple meals that require minimal preps! Bcoz my 宝宝 #zaynchia doesn’t have the habit of playing alone...so he would either scream for me to play with him or demand to be carried in my arms as I cook. 😂 And making tacos 🌮 🌮 🌮 seems like an easy option.... 😋 .

What’s in my tacos:
- tuna with sweetcorns and diced red onions
- cucumber
- baby leaves
- roasted bell peppers
- almond yogurt sauce (with garlic powder and lime juice) .
