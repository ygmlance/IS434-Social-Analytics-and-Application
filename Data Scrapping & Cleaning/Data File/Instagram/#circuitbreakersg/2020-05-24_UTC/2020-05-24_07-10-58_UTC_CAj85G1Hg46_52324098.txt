What’s better than a crispy rustic Soughdough bread? A crispy rustic Multigrain Sourdough bread filled with Cranberries & Pecans.
.
Paired with a delicious creamy bowl of New England Scallops and Barramundi Chowder.
.
This was the perfect lunch that reached in and warmed our souls, a real feel good bowl of goodness with a perfect tangy SD!
.
Recipe for my homemade tummy-warming Chowder.
.
Ingredients:
1 tbsp vegetable oil 
1 leek, sliced 
2 tbsp AP flour for Roux
2 cups fish stock + 1 cup water
1 cup scallop stock (dried scallops boiled till soft, abt 45mins, then puréed or you can leave flaked) optional 2 potatoes, 2cm rough cut 
1 carrot, diced 
1/3 tsp of ground nutmeg 
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup cooking cream 400g Barramundi fillets, cut into 2cm pieces (I grill my fish before adding to the chowder while plating).
.
METHOD: Heat oil in pan. 
Add leek & fry till softened.
Stir in flour, cook 2 minutes.  Stir in stocks + water & bring to boil.
Add potatoes + carrots & cook till almost tender. 
Add nutmeg, milk & cream, bring to boil.
We like a thicker chowder but add milk if you prefer it lighter. 
S&P to taste. I prefer Fresh cracked Pink Himalayan & Black Pepper. 
Top with dried or fresh chopped Parsley, I ran out so replaced  with a drizzle of truffle oil. 
Serve with a good loaf of SD like the ones from Diana @droolcookclub
.
I have a no cream version too.
Barramundi from @kuhlbarra always good!
