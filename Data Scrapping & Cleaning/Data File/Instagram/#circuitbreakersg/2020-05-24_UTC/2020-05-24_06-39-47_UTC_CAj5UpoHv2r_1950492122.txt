Zahn dropped his second tooth! He didn’t get anything from the tooth 🧚‍♀️ last time because he lost his 🦷! 🤦🏻‍♀️ So this time he ensured that he kept it properly after brushing it (thanks to reading Peppa Pig books). 😊 In fact, I had totally forgotten about it. And that was why in the vid, I wasn’t able to answer why there was nothing under his pillow when he woke up and tooth fairy only turned up afterwards! 😝 Please pardon my irritating high-pitch voice in the vid too.
