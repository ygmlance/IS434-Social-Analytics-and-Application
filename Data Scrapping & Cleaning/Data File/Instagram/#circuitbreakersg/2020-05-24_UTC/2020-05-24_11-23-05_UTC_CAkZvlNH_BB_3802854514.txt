I am always craving for fried chicken during this CB period. Was it because of the korean drama supper scene?! They are always munching chicken, reminded me of times when I was in korea with my friends.. we always ordered chicken for supper too! Box full of soya sauce and chilli korean chicken wing and drumlets!! Wuhoo! Miss it.. I pester the hubby to find me korean chicken , so the nearest and easiest without delivery we could get is 4fingers.  Not my ultimate favourite but still satisfying the stomach! I ordered  plain Japanese rice to go with it as itâ€™s quite salty.. very delicious to go with it. Neutralise the taste a little! Their burgers were good though.. just right for the taste. But we didnâ€™t ordered it tonight.. the calamari was sour and salty.. good to go with rice too. We ordered shrimp and calamari but they forgot the shrimp ðŸ˜Œ #weekenddinner #4fingerchicken #craving #sgfoodie #sgfoodblogger #soyasaucefriedchicken #takeout #circuitbreakersg #dabao #longqueue @gimme4fingers #lovekoreanfood
