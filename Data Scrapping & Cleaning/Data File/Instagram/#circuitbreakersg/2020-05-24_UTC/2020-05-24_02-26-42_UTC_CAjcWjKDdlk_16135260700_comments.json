And even though I was tricked to show affection, I guess any form of affection for my humans are better then nothing at all \u263a\ufe0f",

I pry open the door slowly, and made sure nobody was looking and went to grab the toilet roll by my mouth. I then ran out and went all around the house with the toilet roll in my mouth. So basically, I was making my whole house a mummy and wrapping it up with toilet roll. When mom came out of her room, she was shocked with the mess I created and started screaming at me. I then went under the sofa to hide.. but I guess humans also win? They just got their ways around with me by luring me out with some treats. She then placed me in the naughty corner and cleaned up the place. \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude08\ud83e\udd2a",
