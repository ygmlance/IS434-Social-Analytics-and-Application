This pandemic made me think about the very basic meals created by our ancestors. The simple ingredients they had & made use of. Imagine during those days, no import meat no import ingredients, just all local. So, what are we to do if we do not have imports as well due to a serious pandemic? Can we return to our roots & live as poor, simple but happy people. This is another simple one. Sweet Peanut Rice Ball Soup. .
