Change is the only constant in life. A lot has changed after lockdown. My routine for example is drastically impacted. This is at 3:30am after we finished a movie on Netflix. 
Waise to, I have mostly been a nocturnal person since my childhood but doing Netflix at this hour is certainly new and is happening a lot during this time.

Among all the changes, a small change is the orientation of light in my living room. Lamp ko thoda khiskaya hai and I am liking it.

Ab hashtags sochne ki baari: ðŸ™„
