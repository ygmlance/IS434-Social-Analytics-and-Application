Challenge: “Use an article of clothing/accessory for a different purpose than what it’s created” from @lecherros, thank you! 💝
.
I CAN EXPLAIN. After I did the previous challenge, I thought, 'hmm I should use this hanger while it’s still unbent. I can use it as a transparent bag!' I only realised that my “dress" alone fulfilled the challenge already after I had shot some photos with the “bag” 😂😂😂
.
How I created my “dress”: I folded a scarf from @matterprints in half and wrapped it around my body, rolling the top to secure and cinching the waist with a belt.
