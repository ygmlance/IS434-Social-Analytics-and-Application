No edits. No glitters. No magic.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
This is a bit different from my usual post but this post deserves a place in my Instagram. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
These are my boys. This is the first time they fasted in the month of Ramadan without their dad (and did wonderfully so) and the first time they are celebrating Eid without their dad. Oh no, this is not a sappy post, I‚Äôm just uber proud of them ü•∞‚†Ä
‚†Ä
So yesterday, the boys iftar via @zoom_video_communications with their dad and watched  @fauzielaily and @aanurul on Sinar Lebaran - something we do every year, albeit a little different this time. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Today, they zoomed with their dad again to wish him Selamat Hari Raya. Trying times, but we have much to be grateful for.‚†Ä

Eid Mubarak my Muslim friends ‚ù§Ô∏è
