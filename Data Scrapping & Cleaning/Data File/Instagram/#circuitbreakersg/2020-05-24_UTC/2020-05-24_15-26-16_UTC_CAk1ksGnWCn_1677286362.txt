It's been a long time since I last cooked #nasilemak. Was an impromptu decision while waiting for my late online delivery. Knowing that I have almost the "standard" regular ingredients as what were prepared and sold from outside stalls, I just need to quickly defrost the #kuningfish, fried some #ikanbilis and voila! ðŸ˜œ
