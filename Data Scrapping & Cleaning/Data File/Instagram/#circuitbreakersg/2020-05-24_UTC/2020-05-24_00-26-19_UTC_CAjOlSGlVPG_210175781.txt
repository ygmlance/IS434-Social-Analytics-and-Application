Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri! 
Maaf zahir dan batin.

9 days to "Safe Re-Opening"

When I was growing up in Brunei, I look forward to Hari Raya - long school holidays, visiting friends hosting open houses, visiting the Istana to shake hands with HM 😁 (writing this, I have a sudden craving for the ayam masak merah, kurma kambing, add a plate of white rice.... 🤤) Back in 2006 when I was in India for 6 months, I was introduced to the greeting - Eid Mubarak during Hari Raya. It was strange and foreign to me.... Later I found out - Eid short for Eid Al-Fitr (Aidilfitri)

This year's Hari Raya is inconvenienced by the global pandemic but we'll get through this.

Wishing all Muslims Eid Mubarak!.
