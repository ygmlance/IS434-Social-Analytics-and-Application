ABC Extra Stout 🍺
⁣
A stout that is easy-to-find here and enjoyable enough. Slightly higher ABV than the Guinness Foreign Extra at 6%. Its taste profile is mellower, but still has character. I also fancied catching the occasional whiff of sweet barley under the roast notes. Not a bad drink! I'm going back to black because stronger beers make me drink less 😅
