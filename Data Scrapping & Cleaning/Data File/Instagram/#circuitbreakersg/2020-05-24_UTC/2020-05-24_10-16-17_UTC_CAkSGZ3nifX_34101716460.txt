We had #blackpepper #porkchop and #friedrice with a side of #crispy fried #egg and steam #broccoli for dinner today. It was SO GOOD! The succulent pork (seasoned with only salt and soy sauce - I swear by this) and the spicy savoury fragrant black pepper sauce really is a match made in heaven. I hardly ever eat fried rice outside because my mother makes the best fried rice - it’s also the ONE thing I look forward to eating after a long time away from home or a hard day at work. Truly blessed that I get to go on kitchen adventures with my family..🥰😋👩🏻‍🍳 #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
