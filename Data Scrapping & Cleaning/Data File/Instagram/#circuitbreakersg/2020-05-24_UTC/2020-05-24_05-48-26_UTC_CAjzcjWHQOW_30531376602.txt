matcha mochi filled with fresh custard cream 🍵 didn’t freeze it properly so it was SOFT and the cream was oozing out so didn’t manage to take a pic of the filling😔 could taste both matcha & custard flavours, but i think that the cream flavour was more pronounced than the matcha 😬those who like creamy & milky custard would love this!!
