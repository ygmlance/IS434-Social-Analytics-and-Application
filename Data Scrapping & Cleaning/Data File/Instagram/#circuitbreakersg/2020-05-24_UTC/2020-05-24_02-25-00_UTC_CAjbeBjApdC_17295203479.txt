I got this knife sharpener a while back but never got around to using it. It has been sitting in my cupboard until #circuitbreakersg started. I took it out to sharpen my knives and I never looked back. Struggling with cutting the tough fish skin became a thing of a past. Chopping vegetables like cabbage was like cutting butter. Why didn’t I do this earlier?

Another thing that is good with a sharp knife is that one doesn’t use as much strength to cut so control is actually better. So ironically, you are less likely to cut yourself if you use all the standard precautions.

How I sharpen my knife:
1. Wash and dry the knife well.
2. Coarse grind and then fine grind.
3. Wash and dry again.
4. Put it away in a safe place.
