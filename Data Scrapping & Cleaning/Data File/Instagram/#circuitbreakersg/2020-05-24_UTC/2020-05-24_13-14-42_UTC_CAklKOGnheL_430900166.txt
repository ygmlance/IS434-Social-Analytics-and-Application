Wishing all our Muslim friends Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri. Missing the homemade yummies we’ve received over the years during this occasion, but I’m sure it’s nothing compared to what our Muslim friends have to work around this year - with virtual family visitations etc. Anyways, a holiday is a holiday- let’s find ways celebrate & enjoy with our families & friends whatever ways we can, till we can meet again in person! Sending everyone holiday hugs!! ❤️
