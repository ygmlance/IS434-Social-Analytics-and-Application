Adding some spice to an otherwise normal backbend. This CB has been the driver for change, in the community, in the workplace, at home, in my yoga practice. Gyms closed and can't attend my favourite classes :(
.
But it's also been a blessing. I've never utilised my fitness corner this much and the yoga wheel's finally levelling up from being a display item ðŸ¤£
. 
What are the changes you've faced (I'm sure there are many), what have you discovered (a new recipe or cooking hack?), and what has turned out well? Musings for a long weekend (if the days of the week can still be told apart).
.
Selamat Hari Raya to our Muslim friends and happy holidays!
