Covid or not, we’re grateful to be able to see another Ramadhan and now another Syawal. Salam Aidilfitri, maaf zahir dan batin, and lots of love to all of you from our family of four 👫🐱🐱 stay home and eat those raya goodies! This is the first raya ever that you won’t have to worry about anyone coming over without calling 😂 
Stay safe guys! ❤️❤️❤️
