Today’s artwork is inspired by two things:

1. @jimbobernaus’ incredible tutorial! Those 5 minutes taught me so much and helped me realise that I was going about some things in a very long winded and painful fashion. Well not anymore. This was such a joy to create! And still on very heavy rotation is the Halftone brush from @shoutbam’s Rough and Raw set. It’s the absolute best for creating the texture I love. 
2. This morning’s worship session. Being confined to home means no longer gathering on church on Sundays. It’s been about 9 weeks since we stopped out in-person services. That was the anchor of my week and I really miss that. Online services have been great, just not quite the same. But this morning’s worship was beautiful and this song about our Great Defender is sticking with me. How has your church at home experience been?
