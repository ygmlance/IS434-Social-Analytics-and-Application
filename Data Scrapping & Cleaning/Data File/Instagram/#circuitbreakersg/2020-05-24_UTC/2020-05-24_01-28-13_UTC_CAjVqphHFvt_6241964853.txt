The end of Ramadan brings the warm festivities of Hari Raya, a celebration that is marked by seeking of forgiveness, house visits and enjoying the company of family and loved ones.
.
Today, technology has given us the opportunity to fulfil our religious obligations and even make virtual Hari Raya visits to our loved ones.

Selamat Hari Raya Idul Fitri.
Mohon Maaf Lahir dan Batin.
