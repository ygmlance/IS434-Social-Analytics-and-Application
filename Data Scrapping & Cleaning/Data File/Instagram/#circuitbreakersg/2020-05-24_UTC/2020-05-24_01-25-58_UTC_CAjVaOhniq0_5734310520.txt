Yesterdayâ€™s birthday celebration was a quiet one but I managed to keep a cake hidden in the fridge so there is at least a small surprise for Chris. A toned down circuit breaker birthday sucks but at least he got a new phone ðŸ˜‚ as a birthday gift! #23may2020 #circuitbreakerbirthday #strawberryshortcake #birthday #birthdayathome #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
