Warning the following photos will trigger you to drool! 🤤 Today my mom cooks for dinner! All dishes are Indonesian. Our childhood favourite bergedils packed with meat proteins, different from outside. Hahaha! Shaped some of ours in heart shapes too. 😍 30+ years same taste and same flavour, no change! 🤩🤤 The yellow rice is cooked from scratch too. Supposedly it has to be super orangey yellow color but today it’s kinda of pale yellow? The kunyit/tumeric perhaps? 🤔 I love the sauce to the Ayam Panggang Besengek aka the grilled spice chicken. Yummy! Happy Hari Raya! #circuitbreakersg #singapore #dinner
