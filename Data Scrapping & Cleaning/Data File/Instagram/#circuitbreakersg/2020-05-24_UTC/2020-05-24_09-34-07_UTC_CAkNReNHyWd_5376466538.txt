Selamat Hari Raya Aidlifitri!

Due to circuit breaker, many home businesses can’t operate and we can’t get to enjoy delicious snacks made by our Muslim friends. But we can always bake our own cookies 🍪 This premix is so convenient and it’s gluten free which is recommended based on my DNA reports🤗 
Gluten intolerant is common among many of us but not many people are aware that they have this genetic predisposition. In most cases, the symptoms are mild as follow: • Digestive issues such as gas, bloating, diarrhoea and even constipation • Fatigue, brain fog or feeling tired • Headaches, migraine type • Swelling or pain in your joints such as fingers, knees or hips 
In some serious cases, it may lead to immunity issues as the body tries to “attack” and reject this protein.

Do you know what food should you avoid in order to live longer, live healthier and look better? The answer starts with a DNA kit. .
