Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 48:
We made these DIY pork wraps with kimchi and butterhead lettuce for lunch today (ala Korean BBQ style). Marinated üê∑pork jowl with Nando's peri peri sauce overnight. Air fried it at 200 degrees for 15 min, turned it over and cooked it for another 8 min as the meat was pretty thick.

What an easy way to prepare bbq meat! Was really surprised at how the meat turned out juicy, tender and flavourful. Definitely going to try this again with different marinades.

Biggest plus point‚úÖ: very little clean up for grilled meat!
