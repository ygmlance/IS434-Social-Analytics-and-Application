Braised Duck Noodles are ‚ô•Ô∏è With each passing day, I‚Äôm missing the simple of act of eating/drinking outside more and more. Guess it takes a crisis like that to make us realise what we take for granted. A dish such as braised duck noodles eaten there at the coffee shop/hawker centre would taste extremely different from a takeaway option. Yet, we don‚Äôt have much of a choice now. 
Let‚Äôs hang in there, SG!
