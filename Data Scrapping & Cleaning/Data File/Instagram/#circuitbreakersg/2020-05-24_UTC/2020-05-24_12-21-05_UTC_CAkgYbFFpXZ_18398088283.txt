👩‍🍳MUNCH AT HOME👩‍🍳
We usually make a huge batch of dumplings once or twice a year from scratch, from kneading the dough for the skins to wrapping the dumplings. Since we have plenty of time now, we decided to make some braided dumplings🥟 using store bought dumpling skins (coz lazy😂) First time trying this folding technique and yay, it was quite a successful attempt🥳 Pan-fried them after and it’s really delicious🤤
