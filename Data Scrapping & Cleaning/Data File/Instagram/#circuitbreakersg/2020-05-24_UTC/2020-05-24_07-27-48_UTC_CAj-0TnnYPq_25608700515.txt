The ACT of praying. Tell God we Adore Him cos He is special. Confess our sins to Him and ask for forgiveness. Be Thankful that Christ died on the cross for us, and all the special things God had bless us with. #zionserangoon #sundayschool #sundayschoolteacher #prayer #adore #confess #thankful #thankyoujesus #cross #jesus #1thessalonians516 #zoom #oldschool #newtech #lockdown2020 #circuitbreakersg [photo credit: Sunday School teacher]
