@tracyeinny Camo mask for Kids & Adults launched this morning at 10am and was OOS in the first 5mins! Wahlao you all damn fast! 😅 Haha. 😆 Back orders ETA 12 June so if you’re keen do join the BO line! It’s $5.90 each and comes in various colors, and has a space for filter inserts. We love the rainbow one cuz’ it’s vibrant & happy-looking!! 🤩🌈

Did I mention that the Camo Dress is VERRRRRYYY comfy? Super soft and non-crinkle material, just what I need cuz’ I like to baby-wear/carry baby 👶🏻 and hate that my clothes get all wrinkly. Nice material to wear at home during CB, need more colours! 🙊🙊

Quote “Vannytelly10” for % off orders on @tracyeinny - not applicable for the masks ya. Happy Sunday, happy shopping! 🛍

Ps. Shouts out to @littlebearnie for the KAWAII boba bag. Check Hope out, she still has her Boba teether - happy for her to be your very first baby-influencer! 🥰🥰 Will share another post on it again soon. 😻
