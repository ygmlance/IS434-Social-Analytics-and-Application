It's been a while since I last made bread cos my oven is down for the longest time! Still waiting for the part to arrived at Rowenta service centre 😪 But I managed to bake a loaf of sun-dried tomato bread 🍞 using my Philips airfryer and it turned out so good! Crispy, chewy crust with soft interior. Just the way I like my bread to be. It is a no milk, no butter and no egg recipe, and best of all is it requires no kneading!! Just leave the mixture to proof in fridge for more than 12hrs. So simple and fuss-free! This no-knead bread recipe is definitely a keeper!! Just look for Carol's no-knead bread recipe on YouTube and halve the portion if you are using airfryer. Pre-heat at 160dC for 5mins, then AF the loaf at 160dC for 20mins, flip the loaf over and AF for another 12mins. ❤️ #homebake #breadmaking #homemadebread #philipsairfryer #airfryerrecipes #covid19 #cbday48 #stayhome #staysafe #stayathomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
