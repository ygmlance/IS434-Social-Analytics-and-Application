Covid-19 Circuit Breaker - Day 15. 
A time for everything......
Rose plants once so abundant with majestic beautiful flowers have been almost barren since Covid-19 CB started.  As they slowly get rejuvenated and many new leaves can now be seen, it gives us hope for a better tomorrow. Not expecting or hoping for any huge blooms soon, we learnt to count our blessings and every little flower will be appreciated and treasured! 🌹🙏🏻😍😇
