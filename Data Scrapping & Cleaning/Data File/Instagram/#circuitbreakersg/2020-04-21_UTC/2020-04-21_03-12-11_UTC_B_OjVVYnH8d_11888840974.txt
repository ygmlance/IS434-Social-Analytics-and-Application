My Coffee Moment at Home with #delonghisg
Dalgona Coffee aka Korean Whipped Coffee
.
This delicious coffee beverage which went viral all over the social media and Internet was originally inspired by a South Korean candy called dalgona or ppopgi in Korean which means “honeycomb toffee”. It was a popular street snack in South Korea back in 1970s and 1980s.
.
We have been making a lot of Dalgona Coffee since it went viral on @tiktok @tiktok.singapore and I had previously shared the recipe in one of my IGTV post. But only now I had taken the time to take a nice picture of it.
It's extremely easy to make and it tastes super good, all coffee lovers will love it. Have you tried making yours too?

The Recipe (1 serving)

1. Add 2 tablespoons of instant coffee, sugar and hot water to a bowl
2. Mix to dissolve and start whisking until firm peaks are formed
3. Add ice and milk to a glass and top with the whipped coffee
4. Viola! Enjoy the yummilious coffee 😋
