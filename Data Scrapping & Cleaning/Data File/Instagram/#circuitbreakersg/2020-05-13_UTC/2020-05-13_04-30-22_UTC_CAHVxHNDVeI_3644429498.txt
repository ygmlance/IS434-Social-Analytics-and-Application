Nope, this Chinese Sausages Fried Rice is not cooked by me. 🤪Today I off duty, kitchen taken over by my boss aka hubby. 🤣 I think he must be too free which was why he volunteered to cook lunch. 🙄He cooked everything with guestimation but I managed to video and record down the ingredients. ⁣
⁣
A simple but yummy dish which is very suitable in this circuit breaker period. #cutcost #mustsavemoney⁣
