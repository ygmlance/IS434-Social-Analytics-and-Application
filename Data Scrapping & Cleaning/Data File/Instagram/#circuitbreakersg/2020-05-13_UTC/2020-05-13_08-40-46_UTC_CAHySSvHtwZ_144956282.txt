We have been on a mission for the past 3 weeks.. To deliver as many Trampolines to your homes as quickly as we can so that we can all Bounce together from home. 
Another study from Prof. Nieman and his team—this one published in 2011 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine—found that those who did low impact cardio exercise five or more days of the week lowered the number of upper respiratory tract infections (like the common cold) over a 12-week period by more than 40%. Think of the lasting immune effect of exercise like this, Nieman explains: Say you have a housekeeper come over to clean your home for 45 minutes most days of the week. The house will look a lot better on that first day than if someone never came.

But the more frequently the housekeeper comes back, the better and cleaner the house will look. “Exercise really is a housekeeping activity, where it helps the immune system patrol the body and detect and evade bacteria and viruses,” Nieman says.

So, you can’t necessarily exercise one day here and there and expect to have an illness-clearing immune system. Come back for more movement on the regular, though, and your immune system is better prepared to wipe out sickness-causing germs.

This holds up, even as you get older, according to another 2018 review article published in the journal Frontiers in Immunology.

I always thought Bouncefit was just a great way to burn calories and stay fit.. But now that we know the importance of boosting the immune system with 5 days of low impact cardio workout, we are even more fired up to get as many Trampolines to your homes during circuit breaker. 
Plus we are just really excited to see everyone bouncing out together from home, and your little ones stretching their muscles and getting in on the fun too. #familyaffair
