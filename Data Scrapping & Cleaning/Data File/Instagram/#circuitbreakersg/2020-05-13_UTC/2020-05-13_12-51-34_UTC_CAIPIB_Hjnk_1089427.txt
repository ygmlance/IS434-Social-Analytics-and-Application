SUPER FLOWER MOON | While the Circuit Breaker is making you a home chef, home baker, home workout instructor or whatsoever, it is making me a home photographer because... I picked the right day to stare out of the window last week and decided it's about time to learn the full functions of my phone camera. Got such thing? Like that can mah? ðŸ˜œ

Thanks to @sandyris, I found out I was staring at the Super Flower Moon.
.

According to the web, the full moon ofÂ MayÂ is known as Flower Moon to signify the flowers that bloom during this month somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, where these traditional Full Moon names originated. It was also the last super moon of 2020.Â ðŸŒ•
