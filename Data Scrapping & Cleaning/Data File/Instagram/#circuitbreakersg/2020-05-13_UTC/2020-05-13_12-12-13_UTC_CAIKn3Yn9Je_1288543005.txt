Tonight dinner is #Unagidon for the adults and chicken #katsudon without onion (replaced with salmon and seaweed flakes) for the kids.
.
Couldn't find any #unagi sauce in the supermarket, hence I made the sauce myself. It is not difficult. All it's need is #cookingsake , #mirin , #soysauce and sugar , which I have all the ingredients at home.
.
Add one more #stirfry vegetable to complete it as a #healthy meal.
