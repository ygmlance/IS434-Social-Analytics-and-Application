SINGAPORE ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ â€” Picked ourselves up these beauts from @coldstoragesg going for S$8.20 for any two bottles. Pictured here: Young Masterâ€™s Classic Pale Ale (left) and their Cha Chaan Teng sour made using salted time.

The former is clean-tasting and bright with gentle hopsâ€”itâ€™s made with a combination of Australian and North American hops. A versatile ale that we imagine tastes phenomenal with food or by itself, it has a nice fruity, floral and citrusy profile.

The latter is their rendition of a classic sour and salty Gose made using salted limeâ€”a common condiment used in many HK coffee shopsâ€”and its taste can be described as a blend of dry white wine and citrus with a funky salinity to it. May be a hit for some and a miss for others, although we must admit itâ€™s a fascinating through and through.
