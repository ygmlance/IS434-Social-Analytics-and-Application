This is why I went ahead and explored how I can make puzzles in a hurry!! So nice to see a family getting together over a puzzle. CB can even be isolating in your own home when especially older kids spent most of their time in front of a screen for school and leisure. Puzzles are those kind of things that can connect families again! Hang in there everyone. Not long to go now and we will slowly be going out and about again xxx Thank you for sharing Mrs LG xx #puzzletime #familytime .
