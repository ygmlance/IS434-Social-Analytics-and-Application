𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟑𝟕 - It’s strange how things always come full circle. In this month’s #mysterylunch, my 𝘯𝘰𝘵-𝘴𝘰-𝘮𝘺𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘰𝘶𝘴 sender happened to be my recipient last month. ⁣

Thank you @vivienneeluv for sending over this mid-week perk-me-up lunch! It’s funny how your surprise always get thwarted by the delivery guy. Like 𝐀𝐋𝐖𝐀𝐘𝐒. The last round was the nine fresh desserts you sent over and now, this. ⁣

Nonetheless, I enjoyed my #happymeal a lot! How not to when I have not ONE but TWO of my favourite Chrysanthemum Milk Tea from @playmadeonezo, right? The Lu Rou Bee Hoon from @eatjiak was great as well! Thank you for remembering that I prefer noodles over rice! 🥰⁣
