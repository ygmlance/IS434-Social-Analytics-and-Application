Not much of a story guys, but here is what I felt. Yesterday was the first day I felt the effect and impact of Covid19 emotionally. Those who know me know that I love with all my heart if I do, and if I dont, I can press the delete button on emotion without any remorse. To make the long story as short as possible ....
A very dear friend left Singapore on the Air India evacuation flight yesterday morning at 4.30am. She was due to move back to India, but the lockdowns and circuit breakers delayed it. For the first time in life, I said bye to someone without a tight hug. I love her daughter so much and as that child said 'Anu aunty, I will miss you', I really wanted to forget everything and give her a tight hug. Its natural to want to hug the ones you love. I couldnt do that yesterday.
*Because CB rules & law forbid that. I am not supposed to interact with people outside my family.
*Because we now have to think if its safe for someone if you hug them because you could be a carrier too.
*Because there are fines and punishments if you breach the rules
I was feeling low all day. I cooked, but just couldnt get myself to take pictures or post them. 
Now those who know me well also know this about me ... I am a fighter and nothing can keep me feeling low for a long time. I am super good at bouncing back. 
So by evening, I decided that I will think of only the good memories, and not allow covid to depress me. 
Afterall, we are far from our loved ones only in distance, not in spirit.

I believe that this will be over very soon. They say it will take a miracle for that to happen. I believe in miracles. Do you?
