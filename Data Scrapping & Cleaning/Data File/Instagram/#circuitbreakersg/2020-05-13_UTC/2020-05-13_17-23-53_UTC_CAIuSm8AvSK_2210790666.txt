I'm not sure about you but after having stuck at home most of the time for over 30 days, I'm actually quite happy and comfortable just being in my own space like this, making my meals everyday and trying out different dishes including those that I've never thought I would in my life. I really enjoy cooking even more than ever before because I don't have to rush my time while cooking, prepares the ingredients the night before or to cook them up only to eat them later by heating up. If there's one thing I would miss when circuit breaker is over it would probably be this. 
Is there anything you might miss doing when circuit breaker is over?
