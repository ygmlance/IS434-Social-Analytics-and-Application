Things I do when Advayâ€™s home schooling is going on I am reading this book which has essays sharing few lines about Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice written by Doris Lessing
Elizabeth Bennet was both more alarming and reassuring than we can possibly imagine.Her bold and unladylike dash across country presaged young women climbing the Eiger, shooting rapids, sailing boats by themselves across the Atlantic. Her sense of humour and fastidiousness told novel readers that a young woman could claim freedoms unthought of by her mother and grandmothers, but remain in command of herself, and in balance.
