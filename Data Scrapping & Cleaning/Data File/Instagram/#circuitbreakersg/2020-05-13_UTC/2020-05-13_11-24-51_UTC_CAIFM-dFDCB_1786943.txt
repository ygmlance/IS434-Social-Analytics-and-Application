Baked some brownies the other day because I had limited ingredients and this seemed like the easiest thing to make 😂 ⁣
⁣
Googled around and the recipes all looked similar, with base ingredients such as cocoa powder, flour, sugar, eggs and melted butter. I added in the macadamia nuts towards the end. ⁣

Turned out ok, maybe slightly overbaked (oops) but when paired with ice cream, ooh la la~ hot brownies with ice cold ice cream is a mood.
