Day 9 Hols = Day 37 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Reverse Low Lunges
#7dayhomeworkoutchallenge with #heatherrobertsoncom 
Today woke up earlier to do 2 workouts and found 1 video on #hasfit that has weights using reps! (Claudia wearing blue Hasfit tee) That's the next level of training instead of doing multiple reps.. Heather Robertson's workout today was the upper body, can't do full push ups properly yet and knees are painful.. But I did what I can to complete the whole thing! 
On the home front, the toys was too overwhelming and decided to sort ALL the things on the shelf which had some more books, games, puzzles and more art and craft supplies.. Hope to get it sorted out today! (Back breaking) 
Anyone wants toys and books for 1 to 3?
