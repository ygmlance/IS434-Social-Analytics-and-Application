#Circuitbreakersg day 36

Another day has come and gone. There seems to be good news globally, of countries and states easing restrictions yet at the same time... of new clusters popping up due to the lifting of restrictions.  Maybe itâ€™s not time to read too much into it just yet. 
Just stay home & cook. 
Donner last night : ðŸ”º Combat Baos (Kong bak paus) with Braised pork belly, tofu, taupok & eggs. Braised for more than 12 hours for maximum oooomph and 
Oooh... the collagen....ðŸ˜‚ ~
