Shisen Hanten and Chatterbox is having 50% off all their dishes and 1 for 1 bento (exclusive for DBS/ POSB cardholders) so there is no better time to try out their signature mapo tofu and enjoy free delivery for orders above $80!!🤩The famed Chen’s Mapo Doufu looks every bit you would expect a typical Szechuan dish to look- red, spicy and glistening with chili oil🤤 It looks spicy but doesn’t really taste spicy and goes really well with white rice. Definitely a ‘rice stealer’ dish!🍚
