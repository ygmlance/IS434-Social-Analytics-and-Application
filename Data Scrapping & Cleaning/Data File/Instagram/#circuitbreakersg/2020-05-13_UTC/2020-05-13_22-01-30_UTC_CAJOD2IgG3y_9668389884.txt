Lessons from birdwatching during the #circuitbreakersg : - not all white fluff on leaves are mealy bugs or garden store pests that should be wiped off. It could a sign of a new bird nest in progress! (I’m very sorry to have wiped off the birds’ hard work by mistake earlier 😬) - mortality rate is high for this small bird family... first 2 eggs out of 4 didn’t hatch, and now a hornbill seems to be after the two remaining chicks - a hornbill is more of a predator, which is nothing like my earlier impression. Human daddy saw it trying to eat the chicks today, just like in the birds of prey show we watched at @jurongbirdpark.sg (daddy may have exaggerated that 🤷🏻‍♀️) Now that we know that, bird daddy is constantly looking paranoid... - hornbills might be too heavy for the lights, I might need some bird spikes to block just the big birds?
