12/05/20 | CB Day 36 | HBL Day 19 - Working our hands on the DIY cookie set from @mycookieart.sg! Itâ€™s so beautifully packaged with detailed instructions on how to get started with the kit.

We received the Motherâ€™s Day themed set with flower, heart and even MOM shaped cookies. They are so yummy, Lincoln ate them one after another and kept asking for more.

Swipe to see my creation on MOM ðŸ˜‚ I had to hide these cookies from Lincoln so I can decorate them, if not, they would be gone!

Check out @mycookieart.sg and stay tuned to the launch of their next pre-order!
