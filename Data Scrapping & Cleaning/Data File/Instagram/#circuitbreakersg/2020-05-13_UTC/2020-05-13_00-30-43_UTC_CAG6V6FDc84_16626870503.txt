Circuit breaker has transformed me to try out different ingredients that I do eat but have never bought to prepare at home. ⁣
⁣
My very first purchase of @fassler_gourmet smoked salmon to pair with scrambled eggs 😁. I do love Sichuan peppers, so the choice of flavor was pretty easy for me. ⁣
⁣
Scrambled eggs done by Thermomix with eggs, milk, cream and butter. And of course, a little salt and pepper too. ⁣
⁣
Lots of pepper this morning....everywhere! ⁣
