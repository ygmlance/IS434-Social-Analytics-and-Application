[ 🎼 Can you paint with all the colours of the sky? ] The day when sunset was filled with pretty pastel colours and the strong egg yolk light. This is Day 37 already guys 💪🏼 Was really happy that on the same day & time, that sky he was looking at was the same as mine, just like a puzzle! #sgunited #peewaiyophotography #goawaycovid19
