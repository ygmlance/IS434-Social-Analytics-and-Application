Back to basics with these delicious roasted veggies! 🙌🏻😍🥦🥕🧅🧄
.
Simply chop up veggies of your choice (or what’s left in your fridge), toss them with olive oil, salt, pepper and any preferred herbs and leave them in the oven at 200°C for about 20mins!
.
Our current favourites are mushrooms, sweet potatoes, bell peppers and garlic! 🙌🏻😌
.
P.s. First attempt at rosti with kale since we have leftover kale 🥬 and it turned out better than expected!
