The thing about walking the dog while there’s daylight is the chance to see things around the neighbourhood more.

Recently I’ve realised there are these little containers by the pavement.
Maybe they’ve been there for the longest time but never noticed them cos.. night.

Took a photo, went back to find out what they were, and wow these things are pretty cool.

According to NEA website - they "trap mosquitoes, sensors to capture flight signature, identify species & genre to form an island wide intelligent mosquito surveillance system.” Good to know that while we are all preoccupied with one pandemic, there are silent heroes somewhere out there to help keep the other possible epidemic in check.

And that, I’m thankful.
