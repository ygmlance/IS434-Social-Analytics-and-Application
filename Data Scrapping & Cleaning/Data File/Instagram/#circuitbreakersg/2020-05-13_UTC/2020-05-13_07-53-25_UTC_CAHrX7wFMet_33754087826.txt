For Mother’s Day this year. I wanted to create flavours that my mum like, local flavours that she ate growing up with. At the same time, combine with fun cooking techniques I enjoy doing. 
Together forming Hei Bi Aioli. Aioli sauce is made from
garlic salt and olive oil and found In Mediterranean cuisines. 
Bringing our local flavours to the party with Hei Bi (dried shrimp) giving the sauce a nice kick of flavour and funk. 
Combined with the velvety texture emulsion of the Aioli, envelopes the flavours together with a mayo-like consistency. Anyways who doesn’t like mayo right.

To top it all, extra fragrance from the fried small onion and garlic. Overall forming this umami sauce bomb.

You got to try this sauce! Adjust the amount of Hei Bi as to your taste, I did not add additional salt to this sauce.
