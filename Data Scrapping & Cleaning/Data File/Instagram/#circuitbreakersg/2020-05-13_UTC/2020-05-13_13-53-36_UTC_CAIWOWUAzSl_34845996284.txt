â™£ï¸Ž Breakfast idea â™£ï¸Ž Salmon toast

With the making of salmon flakes that I shared in salmon fried rice post, I add onion to the flakes, add grind pepper and mayonnaise. Mix well and it is a perfect sandwich filling! ðŸ¥ªToast it with slice tomato and mozerella cheese as topping. Then serve it with scrambled egg! Less than 10 minutes and breakfast is ready!
