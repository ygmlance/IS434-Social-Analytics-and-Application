#circuitbreakersg Day 37. Our breakfast today is mee goreng mamak  made this with all the leftover noodles and cabbage from the other day and threw in some extra taukwa and Chye sim. Used my own homemade sambal paste. Indulgence morning. Woke up to light drizzle and cool breeze for a change. Hope the breeze continues.
