What's the best way to savour live Shrimp? I would say Herbal Drunken Shrimp, don't you agree? With the sweetness from the fresh shrimp and all the nourishing herbs, this dish is not only flavorful, it's definitely great for health.

500g Live Apollo White Shrimp
500ml Water
150ml Hua Tiao Wine

15g Dang Shen
