We're already thinking of the dust and creepy crawlies on your child's stroller and car seat, after all, it's been left alone for almost 6 weeks now (yes, it has been that long).⁠
⁠
 We're giving ours a refresh before we take them out for use again. Spritzing them with the Pramwash Surface Sanister - it's child safe and kills 99% of germs and bacteria. ⁠
⁠
We have stocks left for the travel-friendly bottles (30ml & 60ml)- get yours on our website! ⁠
