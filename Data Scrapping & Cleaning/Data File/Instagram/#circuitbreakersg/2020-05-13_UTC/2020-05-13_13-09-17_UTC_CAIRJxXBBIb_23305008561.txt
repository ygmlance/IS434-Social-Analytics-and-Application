13/31 - Missing Teddy
Prompt: Tell the story of a new beginning that's been meaningful to you.
Reaction:  Growing up is full of letting go and growing out of stuff. One most significant is our distant letting go of comfort objects or what is affectuinately called our 臭臭 (chou chou, stinky in mandarin). So my teddy, how have you been?

For #circuitbreakermay, i've decided to take on an experiment in abstract imagery using the prompts from #theisolationjournals , to inspire me from their writing. During the #ecbm (extended circuit breaker measures) that will be in place in #singapore for the month of may.
