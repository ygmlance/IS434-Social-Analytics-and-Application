🕢Dinner: 
Pho Ga with Goi Cuon (Summer Rolls)

To end the week with a bowl of delicious and comforting Vietnamese Phở Gà, Chicken Pho aka Vietnamese Chicken Rice Noodle Soup.
It’s the sister to Pho Bo,beef pho, it is slightly lighter yet fragrant with the broth less spiced compared to beef bowl.

The broth is an art form that take a bit of time. Throw in two huge chicken carcass, the heart and gizzards, charred shallots,onions, garlics, ginger, coriander roots, cassia, star anise, fish sauce, sugar and salt... and slow boiled for 4hours.

The broth seems light but it is utterly sweet,flavourful and aromatic. 
Squeeze some lime wedges, drizzle sriracha, garnished with fresh herbs, paired with homemade summer rolls.

Beef or chicken, I love both!❤️
Oh man, bring me back to the land of pho please !

let’s Jiak!
