Tangzhong Brioche Burger Buns (with recipe) | My dad bought a beef set from @cheeseshop.sg and requested for some burger buns. I tweaked my usual tangzhong recipe a little & referred to @joshuaweissman’s burger bun recipe to come up with these - brioche bread is meant to be super rich - filled with milk, eggs, butter. Also, i always use #tangzhongmethod because after 3 days, it’s still SOFT. .

If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can hand knead this too :) just use melted butter instead of softened butter - and knead it in a bowl first! (This will take significantly longer though 😐).

Assembling your own burgers is also a good family activity for this #circuitbreaker. These buns can be kept for 3 days at room temperature and is also lovely for breakfast with butter, kaya or jam :-) let me know if you try it!
