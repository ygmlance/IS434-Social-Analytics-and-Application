This year's Mother's Day dinner was somewhat inspired by my late grandmother: • Stewed wongbok with carrot and shrimp shells
• Seaweed soup with tofu and minced pork ball
• 'fu rong' eggs with onion

These were food that I grew up eating (whenever went to her house for dinner) and especially makes me feel nostalgic. #1 most missed food from my ah ma would be her prawn mee. I miss you ah ma #RIP

Things were kept simple partially cos didn't want to go out unnecessarily to get additional groceries, and didn't do takeaway cos everywhere sure v busy/full slots cos of Mother's day; My family generally try to steer away from dining out/taking away for such 'commercialised holidays' (such as Valentine's, Mother's day/Father's day, Christmas). Plus homecooked food is always better... Cooked with love. Right? And healthier too cos can control the amount of salt that goes into your food (I mean some places pile on the salt like it's free).

Swipe to see what I cooked last year for Mother's Day >> (top to bottom) Kang kong with dried chilli shrimp paste (hei bi hiam), white fungus chicken soup, stir fry black pepper beef, steamed vegetables with shimeiji mushrooms (and rice not pictured). Can't believe I didn't post pics of this (tho I know I insta storied them), and yes, all dishes cooked by me. Planned in advance and grocery shopped for everything; white fungus chicken soup and kang kong were requested dishes by mum. Really #三菜一汤
