It was another 7 hour back to back Zoom day of workshops, meetings, and leadership programme pilots. Another day of finding ways to push back on these demanding schedules when we also have a 5 year old who needs our love and attention outside of the 2 min break I have to insist on between calls. But today, I felt energised to take this on, because my company pushed for a weeklong company-wise break last week. Grateful for being able to take time off during these tenuous times, even if it’s for a home-cation. How else would I have found time to do make a Superpower Cape for my little superheroine?  In fact, if you ask her, she’d say I was on a Playcation 😍😜.
