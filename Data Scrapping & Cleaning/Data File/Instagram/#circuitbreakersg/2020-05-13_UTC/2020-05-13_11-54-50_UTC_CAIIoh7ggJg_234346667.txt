【Recipe】Another quick roast chicken for a midweek dinner. #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
Looks kind of charred but it’s not, it’s the perfect browning of that flavourful Thai style marinade coating the whole bird. 
Utterly tender and flavourful to the bones. And honestly roast chicken is just a fuss free easy meal that everyone or anyone can enjoy. Plus left overs are just bonuses that comes in handy for meals the next day. #whatsnottolove

Served along with roasted baby onions, zucchini and potatoes (potatoes needs to be parboiled 10 mins before roasting). The vegetables are just seasoned with salt, pepper, EVOO and roast for 16-18 mins. 
Catch me cooking this in my IGS (again🙄). Also sharing the recipe right below. #honeybeecooksthaistyleroastchicken
