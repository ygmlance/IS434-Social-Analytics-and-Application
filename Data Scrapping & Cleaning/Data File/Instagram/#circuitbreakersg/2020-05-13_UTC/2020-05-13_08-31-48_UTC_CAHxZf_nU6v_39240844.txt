Decided to get CREATIVE with the instant noodles I have at home. The MAGGI chicken flavour is a taste synonymous with my youth because I used to have it so often. There are so many interesting recipes online using MAGGI noodles (go google!!) and I decided to try a baked MAGGI instant noodle with cheese. My kids love sausages, cheese and noodles, I canâ€™t wait to let them taste it!
