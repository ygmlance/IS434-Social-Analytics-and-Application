Made Pumpkin Rice for the first time last night and it was #delish! A #delightful combination of #shallots, #garlic, #mushrooms, dried #shrimp, #porkbelly, #pumpkin and #rice, it was an #easy one pot dish to make all in the pressure cooker. I also made a Yam variation last month, which Iâ€™ll post about soon!
