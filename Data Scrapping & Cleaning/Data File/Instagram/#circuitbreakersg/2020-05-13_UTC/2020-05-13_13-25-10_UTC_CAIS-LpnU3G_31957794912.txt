Chorizo Scotch eggs anyone? Hailed as a banal and traditional pub grub across UK, it is to me an excellent perk-my-spirits-up kind of food in part to the times I spent in London in those yesteryears. Never mind that I was working then but I recall I had some of these best ones in a nondescript watering hole in a wall. .
Chorizo scotch eggs are typically coated with breaded deep fried sausage meat. This time, I cheated by using minced pork as I dont have any sausage meat on hand. But ooh la la, it gives me more play to the flavors I desire: a medley of garlic & onion powder, laced with pepper & paprika. Breaded it & then deep fried to a rich golden hue. Paired it with some caramelised red onions & mushrooms bathed in of course, beer. Duh. Love, love, love the marinated meat! N look at those eggs, oozing with orange divine goodness. And a thick cream tomato soup as an additional dip. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ¤© .

Munched on this with some stout and jamming on my keyboard - bliss. #thosedaysinlondon .
