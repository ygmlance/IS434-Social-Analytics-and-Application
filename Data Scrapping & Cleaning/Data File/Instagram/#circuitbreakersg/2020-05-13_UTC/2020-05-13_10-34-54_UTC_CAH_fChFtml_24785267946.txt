While seafood is generally safe to eat, it is important to adhere to careful selection and handling to minimize food poisoning.⁣
⁣
Big fishes, especially those higher in the food chain, may have higher mercury content. This can affect an unborn child's nervous system. Hence, expectant mothers and young children are advised to eat such seafood in moderate quantities.⁣
⁣
Here are some quick tips on how you can retain its quality and safety for consumption:⁣⁣
⁣
• Avoid seafood that has a strong ammonia smell. Dead shellfish is not edible and should be avoided.⁣
• When buying fish, choose those that are shiny, bright, and with scales intact. Fresh fish should have bright, clear and full eyes and firm flesh. Fish gills should be red to liver-red and free from slime.⁣
• Separate raw seafood from cooked or ready-to-eat food to avoid cross-contamination. Thoroughly wash knives, containers and cutting boards before and after handling raw seafood.⁣
• Always cook seafood thoroughly until it is opaque and flaky. This will ensure that viruses and bacteria are killed.⁣
• If you need to freeze the seafood, divide into portions based on your normal serving size. Ensure that there is sufficient space in between items placed in the refrigerator or freezer so that cold air can circulate freely.⁣
• When storing or thawing seafood in the refrigerator, place the seafood in containers or trays to prevent the juices from contaminating other food.⁣
• Do not overstock your seafood supply. Follow the rule of first in / first out, i.e. use older stock first.⁣
