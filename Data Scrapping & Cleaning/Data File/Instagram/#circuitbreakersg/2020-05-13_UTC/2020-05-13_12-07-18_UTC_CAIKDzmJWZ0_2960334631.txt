All we got now is the memories of our travels, visits & freedom of taking off any place & country just as we pleased or wanted ...... .
. "It's the little memories that will last a lifetime"  so true this quote holds in today's scenario ..... Looking back now, so many small & little things have become indeed a blessing .... Waiting to travel back again & esp to Mumbai, India to spend some time with my parents, cousins & old friends ❤❤ This pic was taken enroute from Lonavala to Mumbai last oct 2019 .... Such a scenic view, had to stop a while to click a pic 📸
