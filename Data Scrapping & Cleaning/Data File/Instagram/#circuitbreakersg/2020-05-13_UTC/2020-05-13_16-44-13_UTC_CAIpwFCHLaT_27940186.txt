â€œSome see Rice, ðŸŒ¾ We see Radiance.â€œ ðŸ¤©

Why i Love this Origins MODERN FRICTION Natureâ€™s Gentle Dermabrasion is that it makes my skin smooth, gives me radiance and brightens my skin... This is a scrub that is so rich and creamy (made from rice starch)- you wont feel any pain... Smells so good youâ€™ll feel like in a spa... ðŸ’šMy Origins Skincare collection is not complete without it.
