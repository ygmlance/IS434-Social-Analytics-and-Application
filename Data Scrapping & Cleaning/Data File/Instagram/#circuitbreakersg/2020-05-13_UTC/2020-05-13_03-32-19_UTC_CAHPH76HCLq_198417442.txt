💖Jjamppong💖
Have been wanting to try this dish - Korean spicy seafood noodles soup for while. Because I always see the Koreans on reality TV having a hard time deciding which they prefer this or jajangmyeon. Hahaha. 
Tried jajangmyeon before because it is like more common in the Korean restaurants in Singapore. I don’t mind it but I wouldn’t actually crave for it. It is a sweet savoury black bean meat sauce over noodles. 
My virgin experience with this Jjamppong from @ajummasg make me choose team Jjamppong side without any procrastination. I have fallen head over heels for the rich spicy seafood broth. 😍 Way more addictive and you don’t get jerlat compared to the thick sweet Jajangmyeon sauce. I can taste the smokiness of their charred vegetables in the broth as well.

Found kimchi and cloves in the broth. Didn’t expect cloves that are common in Chinese cooking to be used in the soup. Came with 4 mussels, 4 prawns, sotong slices and half a mini crab, which didn’t have much meat. But the highlight is the broth and noodles! It is like a perfect balance of so many layers of flavours. Not just spicy soup made from Korean gochugaru or gochujang. The soup is thick (like tonkotsu ramen broth texture) so it definitely was boiled for hours to have the sweetness of the seafood. 👍 Noodles was also on point - soft and chewy. 😍 Not your regular instant noodles ramen. I think this is my new favourite Korean dish! 💓
