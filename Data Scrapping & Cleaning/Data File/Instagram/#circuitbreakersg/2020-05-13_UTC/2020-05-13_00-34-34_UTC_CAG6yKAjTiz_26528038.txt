Duct taping a bunch of flowers around the lens is basically the same as a bursting flower garden, yes?! 🌸 .

If I had made my trip to the Botanic Gardens where I originally wanted to shoot this dress, I would have had to don a face mask and also we aren’t really supposed to leave our house unless it is for exercise or essential shopping (and then only one member of the family at a time) and I don’t think shooting this stunning dress qualifies as “essential” right now. I also don’t think my floral stilettos would easily be accepted as “exercise attire”. So I follow directions and will shoot around the house until we can wander free again. Maybe I can find a matching mask to the dress… or I could spend my time hot glueing flowers onto one of my paper ones. Now that would be a look to shoot! .

ps- I’m killing all my plants. I’m so busy with the kids that I forget to water them. Priorities y’all… I’m not forgetting to water the kids! If my plants yelled at me for water then maybe they would get more attention.
