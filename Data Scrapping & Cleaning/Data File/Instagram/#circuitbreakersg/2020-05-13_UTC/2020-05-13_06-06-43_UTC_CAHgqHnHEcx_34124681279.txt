In This Together
Lyrics :
Superhero have emerged, like the doctors and nurses we thank them for their courage and strength

We love them even more and more, and more and more

In this together, during this time of the circuit breaker, let's do our part.

In this together, as one nation, we can be stronger for everyone. .
