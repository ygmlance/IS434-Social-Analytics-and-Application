The index finger calluses are coming along nicely now üí™üèº

Can't see a way around developing tougher skin to better handle physical training involving the grip. I used to wear gloves when doing pull ups and muscle ups, but then decided what's the point of being able to do something only when you're all geared up? ‚Å£

My definition of true mastery in the physical realm is the ability to perform a feat naked. The only exceptions are where external assistance is employed for very specific objectives in specialised forms or elite levels of physical activity, and even so you'll have to bear in mind that you won't be able to pull those off at all or as well without the external aids.

This is why I put myself through a fair amount of pain and some mild disapproval from the wife to build physical adaptations that will allow me to better engage in the activities that I enjoy doing, which includes strange new hobbies like card tearing, and some older ones like pull ups and muscle ups.
‚Å£
In any case, having a tougher and stronger pair of hands can only be useful if you're serious about weightlifting and/or bodyweight training. So I'll recommend ditching the gloves and letting the body do what it does best - adaptation and mastery.
