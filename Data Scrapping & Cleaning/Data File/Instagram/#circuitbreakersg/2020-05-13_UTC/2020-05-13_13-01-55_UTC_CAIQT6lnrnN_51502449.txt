An attempt to deconstruct the traditional Filipino dish, Pinakbet. Elements included the pungent but umami-bomb Bagoong Rice - sauteed with shallots, ginger, garlic, fermented shrimp, and brown rice - pangrilled eggplant, blanched long beans, baby tomatoes, and roasted pork belly, drizzled with EVOO. Interesting attempt, but it lacked the really flavourful pinakbet jus. I will try that next time! #pinakbet #pakbet #filipinocuisine #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
