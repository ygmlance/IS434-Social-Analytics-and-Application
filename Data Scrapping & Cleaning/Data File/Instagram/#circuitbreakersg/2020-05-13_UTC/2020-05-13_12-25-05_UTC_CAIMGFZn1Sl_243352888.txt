🌧️We're in the same storm, but we're not in the same boat 🌊⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Some of us are in a fairly cosy boat with our loved ones 🚤 Some are alone in tiny sampans and ricochetting amongst the huge waves 🛶 Some are in luxury yachts with sun beds to enjoy the view ⛴️ Some are in crowded makeshift boats without individual beds 🚢Some are in lifeboats, trying to pull in people who have fallen into the water 🚣🏻‍♀️👩🏻‍⚕️🏥⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
😔If you're feeling worried, stressed or anxious because of the waves that beat non-stop upon your boat, there's professional help who's here to listen at 1800-202-6868 (National CARE Hotline) 📞⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
🇸🇬Also, every Thursday at 8pm till CB ends, landmarks around the world and in Singapore, such as MBS, Gardens by the Bay and the Esplanade are lit up in blue as a sign of solidarity against Covid-19 and all the challenges it brings 💙⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
This situation affects all of us differently. Let's float closer, so we can weather it together 🤝 This storm WILL pass and we can celebrate the rainbows face-to-face after.⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Sending you my love 💙⁠
