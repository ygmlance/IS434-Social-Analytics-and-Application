Do your little ones love to read books? What book do they like to read?

@myprincetravis loves reading! I always love to expose him to a wide variety of books. I especially love books from @scholastic.asia His favourite are tractors, trucks and their lift & flap series. He can read over and over again! This is the best time to cultivate reading habit.
