#circuitbreakersg day 37

Was about to prepare dinner when the hubs came home from grocery shopping with my favourite McWings and McNuggets! ðŸ¥°

Now you know @mcdsg only reopened two days ago after it closed for weeks. According to him, he had to risk â€˜life and limbâ€™ to get these for me. ðŸ¤£ .

.
Ok just kidding. He was at a quiet branch and there was no queue at all. ðŸ˜›

So I put the food that I intended to cook for dinner back into the fridge, and gratefully enjoyed my favourite food from McDonaldâ€™s for dinner tonight. #gratitudediary
