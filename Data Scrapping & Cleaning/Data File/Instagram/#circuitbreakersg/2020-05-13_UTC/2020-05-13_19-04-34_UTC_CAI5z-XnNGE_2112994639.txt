Gratitude, Thankful, Appreciation
.
Part of gratitude is to realise that we will always be completely unable to give thanks. 
And that unconditional gratitude is superior to conditional grateful. 
Never miss the chance to be grateful whatever may come, or not come, in whatever kind of situation. For grateful is a state of the soul for a sound heart. .
