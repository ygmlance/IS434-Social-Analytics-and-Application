It has been a while since we @WaaCowSG. Wife ordered this coz she has been thinking about it for a while. Today is also a day of non stop online meetings for all at home (except the kid), so canâ€™t cook.

Canâ€™t beat eating at location, after the meats are flamed, but that will be a few more weeks. So itâ€™s food delivery for the time being.

We realised the kid donâ€™t like eating it. So I ate 1.5 portions! ðŸ˜‚
