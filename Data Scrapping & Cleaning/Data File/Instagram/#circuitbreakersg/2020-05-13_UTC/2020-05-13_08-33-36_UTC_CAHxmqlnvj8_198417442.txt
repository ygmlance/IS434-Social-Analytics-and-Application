💖Orh Nee Tart💖

This is like the best orh nee I have eaten. 💯

I love orh nee since young but as I grew older and I became more health conscious I tend to find it too sweet. I don’t fancy overly sweet stuff. Like my drinks outside will always be no sugar added. This was like so good. Reminded me of my childhood days yet wasn’t too sweet. Sweetness was just right. And tart base was fragrant oh so buttery and crumbly. Look at how smooth and creamy the filling is! 😍 Definitely need to back for their peanut mochi and yam bun. Should be the same awesome orh nee filling. 💓
Thanks @mingjiejiee! 😘
