We received many private messages asking about the harp from the previous post. So we decide to show some videos on how the beautiful sound from this Harp captured the heart of a 3 year-old girl, Lyra.

Lyra is playing the harp on the first video in freestyle. And on the second video, she figured out her favourite tune. All by herself! Of course, we have introduced solfege (do-re-mi) to her since young and the rest we do is just letting her explore by herself.

This harp is a perfect fit to her age. Light weighted, which allows her to carry around by herself; 15 strings only, which allows her to reach the furthest strings with both hands.

The beautiful craftmanship and the natural mellifluous sound attracting the young girl constantly request to play it daily.

PM us for more details, or visit @artists_music_studio 😉👍🏻 We are going to post another video of a simple tune played with this harp. So stay tuned!🎶
