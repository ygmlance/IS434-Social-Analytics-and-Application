👉 swipe for a visual guide to souffle making + notes I've made! ☺️

what's 1 dish you've always wanted to try making and have yet to attempt? 🙆🏼‍♀️
.
for a long time, I've wanted to try making souffles but was intimidated by them. my biggest worry was that it wouldn't POOF up 🌋🤩 closely followed by that it wouldn't be light, airy and creamy in the middle 🤤 (I dont like it aerated & not creamy, like a souffle omelette...it tastes like cheesey air bubbles: tasty but not substantial)
.
finally, I stumbled across @frenchguycooking 's video on YouTube but didnt have the measurements written down 🥺 so found a similar recipe on @seriouseats and because I'm a visual learner & don't like to dirty my screen scrolling...here's a 1 pg pictorial summary  of the steps & my #lessonslearnt 🤗
.
for quick reference: here's the amount of ingredients from both sources above
1. for bechamel:
- 45g butter
- 25g flour
- 235g milk
.
2. for eggs: 4 yolks, 5 whites
.
3. cheese: 85g gruyere/cheddar
.
4. baking temps: 200°C for 18-22min (I like mine crisp & gooey 🤗)
.
lastly, dont worry if you dont grease & coat it properly...I didnt but it STILL rose! it will poof as long as the eggs are whipped I realised 😅
.
anyway, my next challenge is croissants! what's yours? ☺️
