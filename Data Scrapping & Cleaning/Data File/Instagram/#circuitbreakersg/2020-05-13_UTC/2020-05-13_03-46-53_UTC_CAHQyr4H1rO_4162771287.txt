Day 37 of circuit breaker (13/5/2020).
.
Didn't sleep much as woke up a couple of times. 
Glad that I have the light wholemeal soft buns blessing from a friend yesterday so I made a quick simple breakfast toast bun (melted cheese with unsalted crunchy peanut butter), coffee without sugar,  tangerine and banana. 🥯🧀🥜☕🍊🍌
.
And great to be able to make it to support a dear friend's (@chillipadibeeb) BNI zoom invite at 7.30am. .

Awesome and blessed Tuesday, everyone! 🙏👍💖💪👏
