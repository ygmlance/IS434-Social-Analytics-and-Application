5 D's Every Entrepreneur Should Know
DEFINE – Identify the problem

Take the time to identify exactly what difficulty is obstructing your success. Getting to the root of the issue is an important step to solving it. Do your best not to attempt to tackle multiple problems at once. Instead, focus on one issue at a time.

DEVELOP – Develop a plan of action

Gather information, ask for help, and develop a plan of action. Having a plan is key to making sure you stay on track and find the appropriate solution in the shortest amount of time.

DELIVER – Implement your plan

Now that you understand the root of the problem and have appropriately prepared to solve it, implement your plan. 
DISCOVER— Evaluate and learn from your results

After pushing through difficulty and making necessary changes, it will be time to check your progress and stack it up against where you started. Evaluate the results and effects of your plan. What did you learn? What worked well, and what did not? Learn from these results and prepare to take the next steps.

DETERMINE— What are the next steps?

Based on your experience, were you able to solve your problem? Measure the effectiveness of the plan you chose and determine whether you need to go back to the drawing board. It may be helpful to solicit feedback from those close to you who may have been aware of your problem or affected by the changes you made.

Fear of failure is one of the most common reasons people put off the necessary steps to solve their problems and ultimately achieve their goals. Keep a positive attitude, maintain a focused perspective, and implement the 5 D’s to help you work through your problems on your way to success.
