@8koreanbbq is named after its eponymous 8 Colours Set, which features scrumptious slices of pork belly in an array of flavours. Strips of thick-cut pork belly are flavoured in eight different ways â€“ wine, original, ginseng, garlic, herb, curry, miso, and red pepper paste. Try their mouth-watering dishes for yourself by ordering some in! Letâ€™s continue to support our eateries in Singapore through this difficult time by ordering via direct islandwide delivery.
