~ Pasta Pepperonata with Salmon ~ I'm trying to add peppers into the Simlets' diet because of the nutritional value. It's tricky though especially for the younger one. He doesn't like spice. I added Crème fraîche and milk to make it slightly  creamier and to reduce the smell of the peppers. I think it worked well. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #pasta #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
