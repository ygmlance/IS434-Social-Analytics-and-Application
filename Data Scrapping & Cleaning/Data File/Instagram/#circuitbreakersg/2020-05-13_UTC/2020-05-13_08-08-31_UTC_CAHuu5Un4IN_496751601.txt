𝗬𝗢𝗨 𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 𝟮 𝗪𝗘𝗘𝗞𝗦!

Just did an AC session with Felice. My daughter is very angry. With me. 😅

Apparently, I promised her Kelmen and Mungo are only here for recovery, then after which they would go for boarding until they get rehomed. So 2 weeks, extended to 3 weeks, and then errrr stuck now because of Circuit Breaker. And now we have to extend their stay by yet again 3 more weeks before they can be adopted out for home trials.

Felice is so mad at Kelmen and Mungo for messing up the living room and scattering the toys all over. She especially hates seeing Kelmen roll on the floor. According to her, he rolls around and pushes all the toys to "everywhere". My girl also damn exaggerative lah. Only a small part of the living room leh... 🤣

Charlene also tried to explain to Felice about Circuit Breaker. We said if we go to other people's houses, police will catch us, or we may fall very sick. She could understand a little (smart lass), but she used our words and shot us back. "Since you say all of you cannot go out, then why you still can go out and bring cats home! There, that one!" OMG... She is too smart. "That one" refers to Ferrero. While we were talking, Ferrero was actually yelling in the background. She totally cannot stand Ferrero's yowling, so I promised her 3 more days. We have targeted to release him on Friday night. She 😑... After a lot of persuasion, she finally said, "You say 3 more weeks only ah..." 😅

Then we had to break the news... "Jie Jie, we really cannot guarantee leh... This one we got no say... If the Uncle go on TV and say extend again, then we all still have to stay at home..." Felice was very annoyed already, she said, "WHO IS THIS UNCLE! THEN PUT ALL THE CATS IN HIS HOUSE LAH!" Charlene and I LOL, who dares to put cats outside that Uncle's house? Who dares?!? Hahahahaha

Tolong, no more extensions please. Everypawdy please stay home. Like that I can get the foster cats started on home trials sooner. I thank all of you on Felice's behalf. 😂
