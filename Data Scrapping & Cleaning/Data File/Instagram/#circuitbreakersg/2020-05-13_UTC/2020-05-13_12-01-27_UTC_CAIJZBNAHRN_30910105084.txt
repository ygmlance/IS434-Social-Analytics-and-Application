Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 37:
Was inspired by my friend's dinner post @fiefie2q12 and asked her for the recipe to make these cabbage rolls. These were fun to make!

Recipe:
1. Season and marinate the minced pork with light soya sauce, pepper, 1 egg and corn flour.
2. Blanch cabbage leaves. 
3. Place a ball of minced meat onto the stem side of the cabbage leaf. Roll the cabbage stem and fold the excess cabbage leaves around the minced meat, like making a wrap.
6. Steam for 15 minutes.
7. Optional Sauce: Mix a spoonful of oyster sauce, light soya sauce and dark soy sauce into a small bowl. Add a few spoonfuls of broth from the steamed cabbage dish into the bowl and mix. Pour sauce over the cabbage rolls. 
8. Garnish with chopped spring onions. 
Delicious and healthy!
