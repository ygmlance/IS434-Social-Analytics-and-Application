Sharing my love for Taiwanese beauty products during this #stayhome period, here's my review on some of the best I've tried so far!

My favourite has to be the @forestbeauty_sg Botanical Series Foil Mask, using natural botanical extracts, I love how my skin feels softer after applying this twice in a week! Next up is the hot selling mask by @forbelovedgirl, their signature cloud silk mask material wraps around nicely, allowing the skin to drink in the mask's essence for maximum absorption. If you're looking to achieve luminous & radiant youthful skin, the Super Diamond Bright Radiating Concentrate by @jingchengsg might be worth a try! Agreeing with my oily combination skin type, the concentrate quickly melts into the skin within seconds of applying it!

Together with Artisan Glam, I'm giving away to 2 winners - 6 x For Beloved Girl Masks (the range featured in the post) & 1 x Forest Beauty Botanical Series Foil Mask to each winner!
