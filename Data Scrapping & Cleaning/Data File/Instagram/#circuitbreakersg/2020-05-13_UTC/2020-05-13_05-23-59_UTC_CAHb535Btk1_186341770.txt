Being lockdown at home, I realised the worst part of online shopping is having to get up and get your credit card out from your wallet! Haha 🤣👍🏻

🙋🏻‍♂️ raise your hand if it's TRUE for you too! Haha 🥰👍🏻

Last year, I was "shopping" at one of the amazing market. Built during the 4th century for the Roman's king. Wandering through the old town labyrinth was one of the most amazing experience for me. ♥️👍🏻

I am not really a shopper and I dont really buy things except for gadgets haha. But I love visiting the old town markets, because it's a culture. Seeing the colourful merchandise show the differences between cities and countries.

I guess certain things must be felt personally, it cant be translated through internet photos and videos. 😍👍🏻

Where is the shopping you wish to go and what items you wish to buy right after the lifting of lockdown measures? ♥️👍🏻
