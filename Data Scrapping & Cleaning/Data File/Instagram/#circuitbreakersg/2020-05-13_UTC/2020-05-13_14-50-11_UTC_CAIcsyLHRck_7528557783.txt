We took a trip to London yesterday. We took the famous London Red bus to learn some addition and visited the “Big Ben”. While visiting Big Ben, we learnt about time using our “Big Ben” clock and saw “London eye” using Isaac’s Ferris wheel artwork. 
Book read,”Atlas of the world” from @Monsterbookery 
If you have not seen our London Red Bus, it is on our previous IGTV post!
