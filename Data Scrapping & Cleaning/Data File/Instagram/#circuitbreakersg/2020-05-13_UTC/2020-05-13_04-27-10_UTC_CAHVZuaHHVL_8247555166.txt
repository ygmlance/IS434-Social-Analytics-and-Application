Made Japanese soufflé pancakes for breakfast with Mum today! 🥞
✨
Love how fluffy the pancakes are. It may be more tedious to make than normal pancakes, but the results are worth it. It’s like eating clouds! Served with maple syrup and matcha from @morihan_official! 🍵

Another entry for Luzerne’s cook for Mum contest with the oval coupe plate from the rustic collection which I absolutely adore for its vintage vibes! 🤎 #stayhomewithluzerne
