☣️HBL hazards at home

While I was watching the latest CNA, talking point video which talks about coping with HBL learning at home, I was very disturbed by an image that I saw. Because the #circuitbreakersg was so sudden, I am sure alot of parents didn't have time to create a healthy and ergonomic environment for kids to be studying for long hours at home.

1️⃣The child on the left is seated on the floor, with no leg space in front due to the table design, her body is twisted and that is going to put undue stress in her spine. Her table is too high for her size and thus she is hunched over, with her having to raised her shoulders up, causing constant strain to it.

2️⃣The child on the right is seated way to high and too far away from the laptop. She will have to hunch forward to reach the laptop, causing undue stress to her low back, hunch upper back and a forward head posture. Because the laptop is so low, she has no comfortable place to rest her arms, so her hands will be unduely strained.

There are so many mistakes in this sitting arrangement that when I saw it I had to point it out. Too much strain and stress to the spine and joints, that even someone as young will overtime run into problems.

Are your kids doing this as well during HBL? Having the same problems?
