My yarns from @craftershub_craftershub are finally here! My first yarn purchase in sg and they were super prompt - received my items a day after ordering. 
The dk cotton yarns are quite different from what I have from the uk and I may have to restart an existing project with this new batch of yarns. Quite a few things on my plate at the moment and I'll have to wait till the weekends to try these out.
So many projects lined up yet so little time!!!
