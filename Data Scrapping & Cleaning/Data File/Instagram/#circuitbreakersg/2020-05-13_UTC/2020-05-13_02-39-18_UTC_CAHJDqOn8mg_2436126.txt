Actually I really miss my lunch-time gym😢 Although it’s rush to complete that workout routine and then shower and lunch, but that hour simply meant satisfaction, fulfillment and motivation to continue that rusty engine of mine for the rest of the day!! Ever since this #circuitbreakersg starts, I can’t go gym, not even downstairs for a jog😣😣😣I can’t bare to look at myself on that weighing machine too😫😫😫

I also miss holidays w #thekayas If not for Lil Melon’s medical needs, I really wish to bring them to Melbourne this year. It’s my wishlist to drive along TGOR (that’s also why I took up driving refresher course earlier too)😢😢😢
