#Circuitbreakersg day 37

Almost the half way mark! 
Dinner today : 🔺 Wanton noodles with chicken Charsiew with our boiled for many hours chicken ikan bilis super flavorful soup 🔺Home-made wantons 🔺 Oven-baked chicken charsiew 
First try and it was juicy, succulent with enuff chao-ta bits for me.
🔺 Home-made pickled green chilis to give the meal a “lift” ~
