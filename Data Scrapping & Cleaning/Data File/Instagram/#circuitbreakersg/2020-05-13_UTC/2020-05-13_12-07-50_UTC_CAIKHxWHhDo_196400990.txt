Dinner this evening, was a bowl of steamed rice, stir-fried spinach, and “Tau Yu Bak”, or Soya Braised Pork Belly, chunks of pork belly braised in a combination of superior light and dark soya sauces, garlic, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, and a bit of sugar. Along with the pork belly, i threw in a block of soya bean curd, and some pork skin, which came with the butcher’s compliments when i bought the pork belly and some lard. Tasty and satisfying! 😋 #tauyubak #soyabraisedporkbelly #stirfriedspinach #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
