Farid, 28, have been instructed to work from home since the Circuit Breaker was implemented in Singapore. Despite the time savings, some have found this arrangement a bane rather than a boon.
.
Farid finds it to be a good thing to be working from home. But after a week, his productivity dropped as the workload is heavier than what he thought.
.
And if he’s unwell and overextend himself, he will also slow down the whole team.
.
So Farid decided to take care of himself and take responsibility of himself. He decided to have a healthy lifestyle – eating well, sleeping enough, exercising and engaging in leisure activities – as part of self-care.
.
Be like Farid. He take this opportunity to focus on looking within himself through upgrading himself, reading & picking up new skills!
