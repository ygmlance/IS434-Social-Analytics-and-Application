Why couldn't Olga get outta her house? ⁣
She had gnocchi 😂⁣
⁣
Olga has been making her own pasta from scratch like a true blue Italiano👌🏼 Emerge from lockdown with your new found skills making perfect pillowy tender (4 ingredient!) gnocchi topped with gorgonzola sauce. ⁣
⁣
For those of you who aren't a fan of blue cheese, gnocchi is such a great little versatile sauce vessel so get creative with your sauces and toppings! ⁣

BON APPETIT😋
