Day 37 - #circuitbreakersg
🙋‍♀️
Back at work! 
Its odd... when I am home, I wake up early on time.
When I am suppose to wake up for work... I want to sleep a bit longer.
🤣😅
Off from chef duties so we have to packet food back. Its a relief for me too as I don't have to crack my brains on what to cook.
