In the mood for something cold for dinner. Luckily, I always have Overnight oats in the fridge for a quick wholesome bite. Added Astalift’s Pure Collagen Powder 5,000mg for that added boost of antioxidants and collagen! Must #Selfcare even when we #StayAtHome . .
.
Steps: .
🍇 Soak Organic Rolled Oats & Chia Seeds with yogurt and Milk the night before. .
🍇 Add 1 pkt of Astalift’s Pure Collagen Powder 5,000mg and Stir.
.
🍇Add fruits and nuts as per personal preference. I have Mulberries, Grapes and Almond Nuts this time round. .
🍇 Sit back and enjoy! 😋
