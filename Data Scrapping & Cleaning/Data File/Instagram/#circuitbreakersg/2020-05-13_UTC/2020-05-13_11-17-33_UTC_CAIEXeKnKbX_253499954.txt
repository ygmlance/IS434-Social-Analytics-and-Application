I love the freshness of the salmon and tiger prawns, with the assorted meat like Butter Chicken and Garlic Pork! The meat was well marinated and cooked to perfection. The vegetables provided refreshing perspective to the overall dish such as the butter mushrooms and baby corns. Also, it also comes with 2 white rice and 2 soups.
