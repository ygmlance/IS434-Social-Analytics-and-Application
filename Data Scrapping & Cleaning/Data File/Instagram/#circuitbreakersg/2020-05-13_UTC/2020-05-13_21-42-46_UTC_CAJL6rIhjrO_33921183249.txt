posting this a little late for may the fourth but hey, at least it’s still may. i’m not gonna lie, i’ve been, as the kids say, going thru it™️ but i’m hanging on. .

thankfully, i’ve been able to keep myself busy by working on a few pieces. i’m a little nervous about posting them. but i also want this space to reflect my personal journey. and i want to be as open and honest about everything as i possibly can. .

i’ve been spending a fair bit of time reflecting on things that keep me grounded. for the most part, this lockdown (or as us singaporeans call it, circuit break) has had me feeling dissociated more than usual. i’ve had a tough time separating reality from dream states. maybe it’s because i’ve been sleeping a lot more than i normally do—at strange hours, no less. .

it has its merits. for one, as a muslim observing ramadan, i have yet to miss sahur and fajr prayers. a breakthrough honestly, especially for someone who struggles with fajr prayers on the daily. .

i’ve found solace in the quiet of the night. and for that, i’m thankful. .
