Homemade Lu Rou Fan (滷肉飯) made easy with pressure cooker. 30 minutes on the pressure cooker and 15 minutes to reduce the gravy to the optimal level. 👌Had this over 2 days and I must say it gets even better after a day! Added a marinated egg 味付け玉子(with the dish’s gravy of course!)to go along with it 😋 .
