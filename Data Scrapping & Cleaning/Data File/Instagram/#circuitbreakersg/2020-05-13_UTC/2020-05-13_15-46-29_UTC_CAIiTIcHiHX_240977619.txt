Today's workout made me realize it takes quite some effort to create a set of workout exercises. I wanted to innovate and be creative with it but still create a balanced set. Sat down, took some time to research and trial before putting this together.
.
Beginning (5 sets)
- 10x Bicep curls
- 10x Squats row to side extension
- 10x Incline pull ups
.
Middle (4 sets)
- 8x Alternate KB snatch
- 8x Divebombers
- 10x Side to side bowling lunge
.
End (EMOTM 5mins)
- 10x Spiderman push ups
- 5x Kneeling roll out
.
Note to self: TAKE BETTER VIDEOS SO I CAN BETTER REVIEW MY OWN WORKOUT AND CORRECT MY FORM. .
