Wednesday Musing.

Keeping to our tradition of a nice breakfast tog during the school holidays. (a time luxury for Mr Tan on normal days)
So we called in breakfast for delivery at 8am, well ahead of time before my first call of the day at 930am.

Very often, we don’t need to wait for extraordinary opportunities, we can still seize common occasions and make them great. 
Afterall the little things in life count.❤️
