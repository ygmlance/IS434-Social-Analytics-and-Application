The world knows that all baking ingredients are suddenly under attack. Never has so much bread been baked. And never has 'bake your own cake, and eat it too' been the go-to birthday mantra. In such times of abundance and scarcity ðŸ™‚ðŸ™ƒ, when my fellow lockdownee asked me if we could carry out this baking soda and vinegar science experiment, I almost jumped with fright ðŸ˜¬. However, since the demand wasn't exactly for a candy for breakfast on a Monday morning, I couldn't refuse ðŸ˜…. So here it is guys. Hope you enjoy watching it as much as he enjoyed using it (my baking soda, that is ðŸ˜¬). #TheAccidentalEducator #ShivInDaHouse #TheAccidentalEducator #science #scienceexperiment #lockdown #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #stayhome
