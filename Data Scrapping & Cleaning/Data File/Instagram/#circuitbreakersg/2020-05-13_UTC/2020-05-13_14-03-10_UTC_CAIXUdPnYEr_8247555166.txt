Finally, croissants from @keongsaikbakery after I’ve been wanting to try for so long! 🍞
✨
Matcha cruffin (S$5.00) - Love the oozy uji matcha ganache filling within for its distinct, vegetal matcha notes. It actually went past my expectations as the matcha wasn’t very artificial tasting albeit still not intense enough for the matchaholic me. Also appreciate that the ganache wasn’t overly sweet as with most ganache. The amount of the filling was just right IMO and I like the fact that it didn’t make the croissant soggy. As for the pastry, it was flaky with a slight chew to it and buttery without being too cloying. Can try for matcha lovers! 🍵
✨
Croissant (S$3.00) - The pastry was crisp on the exterior, fluffy and not too rubbery inside. I could detect some yeast smell which wasn’t as prominent in the matcha cruffin. There was also a slight salty tinge to it. Matcha cruffin > croissant for me! 🥐
