@doctorstitchsg we’ve recently expanded our range of services to provide treatment of wounds such as finger infections and ingrown toe nails etc.⁣
⁣
Mr D has been troubled by an ingrown toe nail for years. He had been going for nail filing/trimming by a non-medical personnel for months. Each time, he will put up with the pain and discomfort, which honestly sounds like ouch, ouch and ouch 😓.⁣
⁣
Little did he know that these “treatments” were actually worsening his condition as the nail itself had become distorted and was growing into the fleshy part of the toe, hence the recurring irritation, pain and discomfort. Although he had seen a GP earlier, he was only given an antibiotic cream and antibiotic tablets, but unfortunately, the root of the problem was still not addressed. ⁣
⁣
Mrs D contacted us about her husband and after a relatively simple and straightforward consultation with some pictures for our assessment, agreed and arranged for us to come out for a minor procedure to treat the ingrown toe nail. ⁣
⁣
“Thank you for the very clear explanation and the meticulous procedure done! My husband’s toe is not painful at all today and he did not even have to take any painkillers 🙂” - Mrs D, wife of Mr D⁣
⁣
Remember, as tempting as it is, please make sure to cut your nails straight across (ie horizontal) and not curved! ⁣
