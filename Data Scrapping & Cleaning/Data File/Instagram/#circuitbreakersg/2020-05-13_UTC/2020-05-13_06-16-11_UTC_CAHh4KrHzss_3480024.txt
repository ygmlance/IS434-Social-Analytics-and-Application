Cir Breaker Day 37 Lunch.
We ordered pizza in today.
I had the tropical dream pizza, which has chicken ham cubes, roasted pineapples, cream cheese cubes and a drizzle of mango puree. 
The Mister had the meat galore, which of course has different types of meat like pepperoni, ham, sausages and minced beef. 
Honestly, I didn't have much expectations, but the pizzas were surprisingly good. Chewy and well baked dough with slightly crispy edges, and fresh ingredients. No complaints at all, except someone lamented why I ordered personal size because they are too tiny for him. I totally agree since they are delicious. Lol
