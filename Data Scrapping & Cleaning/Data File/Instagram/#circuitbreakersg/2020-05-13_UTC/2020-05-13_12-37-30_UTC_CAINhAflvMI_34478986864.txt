Doesn't look too pretty, but still packs a punch! For dinner tonight we had Mala Xiang Guo and a pre-cooked personal Mala hotpot (with our own selected ingredients) from @littlesheephotpotsg. We're too lazy to even do our own hotpot cooking, so the pre-cooked option was perfect! The ingredients came on the side so they didn't get soaked beforehand, and you could choose between 4 kinds of soups. Ordered via @deliveroo_sg.
