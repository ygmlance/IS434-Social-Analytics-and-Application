I’m taking part in a charity talent show organized by @singforsg to help raise funds for The Food Bank @foodbanksg . I’m singing and dancing to the English version of ON by BTS which I just learnt 🤪I hope you can support me by going to my Facebook page (link in bio) and give my entry post a 👍 because part of the critieria for the talent show is audience popularity 😁 . But even if you don’t like my performance please consider donating to The Food Bank too (https://foodbank.sg)!!! 😍 @SingForSg #StayHomeStarSG #SingForSG #circuitbreakersg #stayathomesg #ashermendelsohn #郭文耀
