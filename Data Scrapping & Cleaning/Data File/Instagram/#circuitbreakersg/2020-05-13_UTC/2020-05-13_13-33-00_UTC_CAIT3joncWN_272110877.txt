Day 35. A storm was brewing when we woke up. Decided to rest thoroughly today. Had a simple breakfast. Lunch was salmon fried rice. Chat with Mr. while he was busy preparing for Missy. As usual, littlest one wanted attention. Had a good time laughing while watching. Evening sky was a one with a golden shine. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #spendingtimewithfamily #homecookedmeal #instafood
