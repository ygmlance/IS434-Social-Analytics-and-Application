🖤🍜Was seriously craving some Korean JaJangmyeon after watching the Korean drama Wok of Love that we decided to recreate some at home😝😝 Wasn’t the correct type of noodles but the sauce was great! Sharing my recipe for the sauce below incase you wanna make some!⁣
⁣
Ingredients:⁣
🖤150g Black Bean Paste (Got the paste from @shinekorea supermkt)⁣
🖤2 tbsp oil⁣
🖤550ml water⁣
🖤250g minced pork (or you can use pork belly)⁣
🖤2 medium onions, diced into small pieces⁣
🖤1 medium zucchini, diced into small pieces ⁣
🖤2 squids, cleaned and sliced ⁣
🖤Korean Noodles (we used wheat noodles but I’m pretty sure the correct noodles are thicker)⁣
🖤1 tbsp corn flour mixed with 3 tbsp water ⁣
⁣
Steps:⁣
1)Fry minced pork till cooked and set aside⁣
2)Heat 2 tbsp of oil and add black bean paste⁣
3)Add onions and zucchini and mix well with paste⁣
4)Add water and let vegetables simmer for 10-15 mins until soft⁣
5)Add minced pork and squids and cook for 1 min⁣
6)Add cornflour mixture to the sauce to thicken⁣
7)Cook Korean noodles and pour sauce over!⁣
⁣
Btw if you guys know where to find jjm noodles ( the thicker version, please let me know)🥰 Feel free to substitute the mince pork ok ( it’s not really typical in a Korean jjm but we wanted lots of meat in every bite so we decided to go with it)⁣
