Key item today, Dangmyeon (당면) Sweet Potato Noodles.
.
Tteok-bokki (떡볶이) with my stashed homemade kimchi and chuck shabu slices.
No idea why the Bubba is so in love with the rice cakes.🤷🏼‍♀️
.
Japchae (잡채) Mixed vegetables.
Simple stir fry, maximum crunch.
.
The joy you feel when the bubs asks for a second serving.🥰
.
Goreng pisang.🍌
What I’ve been wanting to do for really long time, attempt this because my dad likes it.
Had a comb of organic homegrown Saba bananas, no better time to dive into it and it was a success!
Bubs ate one and initially said it wasn’t her kind of banana, then she said she could have one more. 🤣🥳
