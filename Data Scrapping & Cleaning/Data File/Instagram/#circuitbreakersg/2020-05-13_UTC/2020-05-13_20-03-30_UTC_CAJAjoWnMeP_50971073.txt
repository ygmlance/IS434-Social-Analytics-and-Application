My 3rd time doing Mee Hoon Kway... the texture is exactly what i want it to be.. soft and smooth with a little "bouncy" feel... im happy that my kids and hubs all gave me a thumbsup... rolling the dough as thin as possible by bottle as my rolling pin intends to play hide and seek with me...
.
Fried Bee Hoon with the leftover Braised Mushroom from the Bak Chor Mee yesterday and Ham Fried Rice for the kids... Papaya Soup... #circuitbreakersg Day 37
