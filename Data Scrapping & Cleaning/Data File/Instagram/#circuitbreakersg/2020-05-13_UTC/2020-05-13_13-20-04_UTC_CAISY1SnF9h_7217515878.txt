59/100: KAYA TOAST (I want to eat this!) Missing the times when I can just eat traditional breakfast openly inside a coffee shop! ☕️🍞 This is probably one of the things I want to do right after #circuitbreakersg 😄

P.S. I realised drawing food is good for practising shadows.. I hardly draw food nowadays, but maybe I really should draw more food😅  what food should I draw next?
