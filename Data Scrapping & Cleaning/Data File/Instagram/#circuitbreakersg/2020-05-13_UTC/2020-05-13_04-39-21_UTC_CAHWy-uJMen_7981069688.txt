Duke Jordan - Flight To Jordan, 1960. This is the only album #dukejordan recorded as leader for #bluenoterecords but he was still very active in the scene having played in Dizzy Gillespie’s band with Miles. On this album we have #dizzyreece and #stanleyturrentine on horns and Duke allows each of them ample time on each track that one can easily mistake them as leader on the record. Such was Jordan’s confidence. This album is filled with tracks with strong melodies, very listenable and will make you look out for more Duke Jordan. Great to explore the lesser featured artists. You will find gems like this one.  #flighttojordan #reginaldworkman #arttaylor
