With the kids home all day, the efficiency of running the house really drops significantly. Add on the administrative parts of HBL and general mess that follows children, there’s almost no time for me to exercise.

But I decided to bite the bullet and start some indoor moving. Every evening I hear my neighbor skipping. I figured it might be a good way to start some cardio. Fortunately I found my skipping rope from sometime back when I was inspired to skip but never really got around to doing it.

Initially, it was really bad. I kept tripping over the rope and I just felt like I couldn’t do it. I also realized I needed to have shoes on to cushion the impact.

I started really really slow. But tried to increase the skips by 20 a day. It was quite doable. I now do work up significant sweat and I do feel my heart rate going up. So I will keep working on this. Cardio is one of the items that #theselfcaresolution promotes. It is something that is undeniably important.

Have you done any exercise? What do you do?
