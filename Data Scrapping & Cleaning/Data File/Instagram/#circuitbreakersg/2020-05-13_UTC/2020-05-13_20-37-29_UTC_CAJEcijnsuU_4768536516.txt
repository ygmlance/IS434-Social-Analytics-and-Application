Even if you pass by the same place a million times, you can still find scenic views and interesting things/objects if you look carefully. During this circuit breaker period, many businesses come to a standstill and we see less human beings out on the streets. But, it is through this period that we get to see cleaner water, clearer skies, beautiful blooms and a more vibrant animal/insects ecosystem. Perhaps this is Mother Earthâ€™s cries for recovery. #iphonephotography #nature #reflection #landscape #beauty #motherearth #circuitbreakersg #covid19
