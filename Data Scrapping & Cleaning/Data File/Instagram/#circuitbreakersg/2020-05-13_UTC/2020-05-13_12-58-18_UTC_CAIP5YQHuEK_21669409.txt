Laksa for lunch and seafood mui fan, beansprouts and cajun chicken for dinner. Its my first time cooking mui fan and the challenge is to make my own gravy without chicken stock cube (I don't have chicken stock cube at home). I am surprised that with very little salt and seasoning, it can still turn out to be so tasty. ✌🏻 After dinner, we made boba brown sugar avocado milk popsicles. 😀 Thats all for today. After 4 days of cooking, I will have my rest day tomorrow.. haha.. 🥳 #stayhomeforsg #stayhomecook #laksa #muifan #cajunchicken #beansprouts #bobabrownsugar #bobabrownsugaravocadomilk #popsicles #circuitbreakersg
