#Orhnee tarts, #cheese tarts and peanut #mochi from #junebakery for today #teabreak .
.
Finally I get to taste these old school pastries from June Bakery. The Orh nee tarts is rich and creamy, taste so good even though I am not a fan of yam. The peanut mochi is so chewy and soft. All the ingredients just blend in so nicely to make it taste great.
.
I ordered the Portuguese egg tarts too but my order was mixed up and ended up with more cheese tarts. Didn't get to taste it. So sad.
