ARTIST PROFILE - MARC NAIR

Doesn’t have hair on his head, but has hair pretty much everywhere else. (Wait, that’s not romantic at all). Let’s start again. 
Does not fail to find discount coupons for shoes, diffusers and bottles of whisky. (Oh, hang on, is that just being practical?) Will gladly do the dishes. And be general tech support for everything. 
Aiyah, I give up, I don’t think I’m romantic, but like a traditional Asian Values person, I express my affection in other ways. Come and listen to my odes and rants this Thursday at 9pm.

GET PERSONAL!
