Circuit breaker Day 37: Vietnamese food 👍👍 Highlight is definitely the fresh spring rolls! $5 for 3 rolls. Dry vermicelli with lemongrass was not bad, but somehow lacking a sauce. BBQ pork vermicelli is much nicer from Mrs Pho, banh mi is way nicer at other places I’ve tried. Still really worth it, all this for $39.50 (includes the $6 island-wide delivery fee). If I were to order again, I might just get the fresh spring rolls.
