Day 37 of #CircuitBreakerSg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Baked Chocolate Milo Brownies yesterday. So happy how this turned out. A balance between fudgy yet fluffy. Not too sickly sweet either. I polished off a number of pieces even though sometimes I donâ€™t eat my own bakes. And easy to make.

You know what's the best thing? It still tastes super chocolaty even though I substituted some milo powder. I don't know about you but I got tons of milo lying around whereas cocoa is in short supply, and more expensive too! Going to try this recipe again soon with just milo powder and see how it goes. At the moment the milo taste is too faint. FYI the more milo u put, the paler it will look. 
Recipe as follows:
55g salted butter (or unsalted and add your own salt)
1/2 tbsp cooking oil
110g sugar
1 large egg
30g plain flour
15g cocoa powder
10g milo powder (I used milo kosong coz I happened to have some)

1. Melt butter in a metal bowl and add oil and sugar. Whisk until well combined.
2. Add egg and whisk until foamy and pale (3-5 mins by hand)
3. In another bowl, combine flour and cocoa + milo powder. Sift if you have the patience. I didn't.
4. Fold these dry ingredients into wet ingredients gently until incorporated.
5. Pour into well-greased pan or lined with baking paper. 
6. Bake at pre-heated oven at 180 degrees for 20-25 minutes. Check for doneness at +- 20th minute. If you want it more fudgy, slightly underbake it, ie your skewer comes out slightly dirty. 
7. Feel free to double the recipe coz my recipe produces 8 small pieces. (rationing lah)
