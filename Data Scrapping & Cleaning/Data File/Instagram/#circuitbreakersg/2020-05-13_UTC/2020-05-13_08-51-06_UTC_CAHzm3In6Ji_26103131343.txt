What kept us a little more zen this week... PORTAL🧘‍♀️🕉🧘‍♂️ @portal_labs An intuitive app without overdone interfaces or overcomplicated functions, and it pairs beautiful visuals (scroll through for a few screenshots) with high-quality immersive soundscapes 🎧🏔🌊 Particularly useful when…
.
You need a little bit of instant calm: (Remember the old adage of, “when angry count to ten”? 😡 A whole lot easier with an Amazonian Rainforest in your ears 😂)
.
You’re cramped up at home and need to carve out a mental space to focus on work/study 🗄📚
.
Counting 🐑 doesn’t help you fall asleep 😴 (you can set a timer for the soundscape to fade and not run all night)
