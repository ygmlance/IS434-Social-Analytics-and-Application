DAY 37, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
Asian style Barramundi
🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟
Got the barramundi with great plans to try out a new recipe. But my appetite was suddenly craving Asian flavours.
Cooked this one in chilli oil, oyster sauce and chicken broth. 
Marinated the fish in lemon juice, salt and pepper. Baked it in the oven for 20 min at 180°C.
Placed it on the dish and poured the sauce.
Made the sauce by frying a little onion in a some sesame oil, then adding a tbsp of chilli oil, 2tbsp oyster sauce and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Boiled it well. Garnished the fish with fries ginger and garlic 😊
