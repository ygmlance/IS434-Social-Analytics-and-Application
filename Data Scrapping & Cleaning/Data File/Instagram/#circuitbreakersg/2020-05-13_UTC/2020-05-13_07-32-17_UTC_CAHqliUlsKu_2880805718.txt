Elbow Lever Tutorial 👇🏼
⁣
You may have seen my one arm elbow lever tutorial, which calls for the elbow lever as a prerequisite. This tutorial should help those of you who are learning the elbow lever.
⁣
𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗲. You should be good to go if you are comfortable with performing normal push ups with your arms and elbows close to your body.
⁣
In the first video, I demonstrate the set-up for the elbow lever. Bend your arms and "stab" your elbows into your sides, just above your hips. Spread your fingers and face them any way you're comfortable with, though I would recommend facing them sideways for most people. ⁣
⁣
Facing your fingers sideways strikes a balance between wrist loading, which is greatest with your fingers facing forwards, and versatility in the sense that you could transit from that hand position to a handstand more easily than if your fingers were facing backwards. ⁣
⁣
Splay your legs and lean forward, using your toes to help support you as you are finding your balance. The angle between your upper and forearms will open up. This may feel strange at first, and the tendency for many new learners is to close this angle. 𝗗𝗼 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗱𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁, unless you are able to hold a handstand - closing the angle between your upper and forearms will cause your body to arc back and upwards into a handstand.
⁣
Looking up and leaning forward more will get you more horizontal. (I couldn't go all the way flat here because I'm nursing a shoulder injury.) When you are stable enough you can go on to close your legs, or try pressing into a handstand from the elbow lever.

⁣𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗶𝗱 you can use is a short platform like a coffee table (make sure whatever you use is sturdy enough to bear your weight). Your legs can go below the level of your hands, which makes balancing easier as you do not need to extend your body as much (see the second video for a demonstration). You can also train your body extension this way - see how my body extends and becomes more parallel to the ground towards the end of the video.

The second photo approximates the elbow lever and reiterates the key points. Stay safe, and have fun learning this skill!
