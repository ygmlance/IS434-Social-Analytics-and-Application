Why am I taking pictures of my food? Because this circuit breaker allows me to fully immersed with the ingredient of my food. Learning of the different herbs and how it will affect the dish. Beside that I am grateful to be able to work at home where I can have a quick 2 mins cuddle time with my husband in between work.
