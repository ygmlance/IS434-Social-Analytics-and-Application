Hi 👶🏻 baby Tasha, let’s talk to each other at eye level! Trying to impress mini-me no. 2 with a baby firefly pose, not sure how I fared. 😂 .
Swipe left to #throwback to Sept 2018 of the same pose I did with the elder one (20 months old then) who was clearly unimpressed 😅. Things mummies do during the #circuitbreakersg to get the attention of their kids!😅
