#CircuitBreakerSG D-37

What's your most baked during this lockdown period? Cake, Muffin or Bread? With the scarcity of flour, these have become rare treats at home.

I've been baking a lot of Granola, at least once a week for our breakfast, snack in-between meals and also late night supper to curb those hunger pangs.

Whipping up Granola at home is super easy, quick & flexible. It allows us to control the amount of sugar and quality of ingredients; adding in whatever we love.

You just need a handful of ingredients: rolled oat, sweetener, oil and maybe nuts & dried fruit. I always add nuts and seeds to my homemade granola for flavor, texture, extra nutrients and healthy protein. I also like to add dried fruit to replace some sweetener.

What goes into my Granola: Rolled Oat, Rice Malt Syrup, Coconut Oil, Raw Almond, Sunflower Seed, Pumpkin Seed, Flax Seed, Raisin, Cranberry and a few shake of ground cinnamon.

The whole house smells so heavenly while it's baking in the oven.
