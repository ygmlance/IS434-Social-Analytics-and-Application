Yusha found this book a few days ago in the box of books and is obsessed with it. He got me to read it to him almost Everyday and I got bored of saying out the animals to him again and again. So I decided to deliberately say the wrong animals and was surprised to find him CORRECTING ME LOLOL. Nuha saw what I was doing and asked “Ibu what are you doing? Are you kidding him?” 🤣🤣🤣so funny. During buka last night @circadiancycle gave him a quick fact about the ostrich- that’s it’s a bird and that it doesn’t fly. Today he relayed the facts to me!! MasyaAllah amazing. This video is not high quality at all but just wanna remember the good and quality time spent with family ❤️❤️❤️ #trusttheprocess #readingtime #circuitbreakersg
