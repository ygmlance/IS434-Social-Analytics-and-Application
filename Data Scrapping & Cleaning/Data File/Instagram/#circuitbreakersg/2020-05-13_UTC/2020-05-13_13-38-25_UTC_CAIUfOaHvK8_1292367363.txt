Like many people, the countdown to the end of Circuit Breaker gives me mixed feelings. 
Although the end of CB means more freedom to go out to catch up and work to make money, it also means most people will go back to the same old lives and have less time for people at home. 
I will strongly suggest to everyone to cherish and remember this period because when the time comes, you will be grateful of this period.

As this is the period that allows you to spend so much time with your loved ones without having to worry about work guilt tripping you. 
For now, let's not think so much and just enjoy the moments with your loved ones. ❤❤❤ @popi_popiec
