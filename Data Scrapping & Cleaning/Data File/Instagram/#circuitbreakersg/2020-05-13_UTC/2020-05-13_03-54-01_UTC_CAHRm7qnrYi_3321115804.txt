Summer is here ! Besides getting a haircut it is also a time to get some sunshine . Sunshine is able to prompt our body to naturally produce Vitamin D which is important for bone health across all life stages. It decreases the risk of hip fractures in the elderly and helps to prevent bone loss in working adults . Research has shown that salty food, soft drinks and stress can all lead to weaker bone health .. so go easy on the chips and drinks while working from home peeps ! One can get a Vitamin D boost just by opening the windows to let sunshine and fresh air in while doing any activity at home.
