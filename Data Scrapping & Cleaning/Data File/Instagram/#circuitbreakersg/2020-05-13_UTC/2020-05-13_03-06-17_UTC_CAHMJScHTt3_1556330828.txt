One of the best delivery meals we’ve had so far is from @allium.sg. We’ve been following Chef Dillon Ng since his time at The Humble Loaf followed by GastroSmiths. It’s a shame we couldn’t make it down to his new establishment Allium before coronavirus circuit breaker measure hits, so for now we’ll have to enjoy his take on regional flavours from home; can’t want till when we can officially visit Allium.
