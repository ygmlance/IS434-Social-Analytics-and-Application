Reinforcing is key for our little boy to remember by heart, the words and stuff he had learnt.
.
.This circuit breaker is not just a time for us to rest and bond with our kids, but more like spending quality time with them! It is however super tiring! Even I gotta admit I don't teach him stuff every single day.... There are days I totally rely on screentime too! And after 'slacking' for a few days, I'll do simple stuff with him again!
.
.Tiring, but still very thankful that amidst this pandemic, I'm able to stay home with my kids... Kudos to those who still need to go to work... It's really hard... I definitely can't do it... At least not at this time now...
