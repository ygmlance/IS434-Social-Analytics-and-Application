My mum’s been asking me to make her pancakes for awhile now, so I decided to turn that into a ‘Day After Mother’s Day Sunday Brunch’ situation.

I’ve done the perfectly round fluffy pancake thing many times before, so for this go around I wanted something rustic with more character - I decided to make some Brown Butter & White Truffle Honey Griddle Cakes, topped with Scrambled Eggs and my Home-cured Salmon. Nothing more satisfying that batter hitting the hot cast iron griddle.

I didn’t have anymore maple syrup at home and couldn’t find any in stock either so I thought incorporating a white truffle infused honey from @trufflehuntersg that I saw on @foodpandasg would do just the trick - and it did!
