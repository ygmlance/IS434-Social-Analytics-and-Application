One of my resolutions for 2020 was to celebrate my birth-day monthly, where I'd have some cake and buy myself something nice.

It was a tad difficult to do this during #circuitbreakersg so @nichlorine and @vivsleepygirl decided to get me a cake (tart) that would allow me to celebrate till November within a span of three days
