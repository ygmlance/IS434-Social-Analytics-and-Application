Snippets of last sunday’s online music history session! 👨🏻‍💻👩🏻‍💻Busy boys and girls taking down notes and participating in the quiz🕦

I was glad that it was successful and students enjoyed it. I have spent many sleepless nights preparing for this and all I am looking for is for them to be able to appreciate and understand deeper into the meaning of classical music 💕

By now, you all should at least know who are the most 3 famous composers in the Baroque Period and their famous works: Handel, Vivaldi and J.S Bach 🎻🙏 Next up! Classical Period! 👋👋👋 #musicstudio #music #love #musiclovers #musician #art #singer #musica #dance #instagood #like  #follow #instagram #song #party #live  #musicislife #instamusic  #musicvideo #onlinemusic #onlinemusiclessons #onlineteaching #onlinepianolessons #onlinepiano #covid19 #stayhome #musichistory #musiccomposers #circuitbreakersg #onlineteacher
