Dinner is ready! So glad that my favourite restaurant @lesamisrestaurant is back!! For now, they are doing takeaways from their “pantry”, like olive oil & caviar (with the option to add on condiments). But starting from 20th May, you’ll be able to bring home a coveted #Lesamis meal like roasted chicken & lamb shoulder! I’ve already ordered my lamb 😉#circuitbreakersg #supportsgfnb @savefnbsg
