Can you tell the difference?  One is a bowl of A1 Laksa instant noodles and the other a bowl of Mama Creamy Tom Yum instant noodles... Noodle confusion!
After realising that it was too late to tapao (takeaway) anything at this hour, I followed today's theme of HK style cha chan tang and cooked instant noodles with Spam, enoki mushrooms and scrambled eggs... Laksa for @iamivanlau and tom yum for me!  Sinfully good for day 37! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
