Since we have a lot of art supplies lying around the house, Iâ€™ve decided to have an art hour with the kids. Itâ€™s so fun and relaxing just painting in silence and sharing one pot of paint since the other pots have dried out. If youâ€™re looking for things to do, you can try painting or coloring or just doing crafty stuff. It keeps them from watching too much tv or driving you insane!ðŸ˜†
