lemon chiffon cake!! with lemon glaze! this $20 chiffon cake tin proving to be a good investment bc danggg chiffon cakes are so addictive!! not so fun part was separating the eggs (messed up and had to use a few more...), using a knife to scrape the lemon skin to get lemon zest as I didn‚Äôt have a grater üò• was a bit worried the cake might be too sour since I squeezed a lot of lemon juice but it turned out zesty!! and the glaze was good sweet so overall both sweet n sour q a refreshing cake ‚ò∫Ô∏è
