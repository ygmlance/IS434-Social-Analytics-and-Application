ðŸ’–Can We Stay Stage Lean All Year Round?ðŸ’–
You canâ€™t stay stage lean all year round because too low a bf% is not healthy. 
There are two types of fats in the body essential fats and non essential fats. âœ…Essential fat is needed for normal functioning of our body systems. The level of essential fat in women is 10-12%. Below this, the body cannot function properly. Nonessential fat is not entirely a bane as well. It has three main functions: 1) As an insulator to retain body heat; 2) As an energy substrate during rest and exercise; and 3) As padding for our organs and bones against trauma.
âœ…Nonessential fat can be further broken down into subcutaneous fat (fat under the skin) and visceral fat (fat surrounding internal organs at the abdominal area). ðŸŒŸIn fact, you may have a pretty flat tummy and still have visceral fat. Thatâ€™s sometimes called thin outside fat inside. âœ…Visceral fat poses a higher health threat than subcutaneous fat like heart diseases and type 2 diabetes. 
That said it doesnâ€™t mean it is an excuse to let go during off season. You can still stay in shape during off season but donâ€™t have to be overly strict on your diet. I enjoy the food I eat during prep so I still eat them on a daily basis but once a while I indulge in food I love or food my loves ones buy for me. ðŸ’“
