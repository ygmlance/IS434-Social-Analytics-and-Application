April 3rd, 2020 - The Singapore Government introduced strict measures with all non-essential services ordered for closure starting from April 7th. I was on the way home and dropped by Sim Lim Square when PM Lee made his announcement for these circuit breaker measures. 4th of May was supposed to be the day the measures were lifted but with the on-going situation at the dormitories the circuit breaker measures were extended till the 1st of June. Over the course of the month I tried to document this change through my photographs while respecting social distancing rules. Will be sharing some of them over the next couple of days.
