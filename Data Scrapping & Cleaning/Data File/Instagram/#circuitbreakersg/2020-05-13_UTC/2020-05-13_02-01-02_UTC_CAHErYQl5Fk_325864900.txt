Grade 6 student Megan launched the #SJIIGiveThanks initiative as part of her #CASS Gold project, to encourage her schoolmates to join her in recognising and appreciating those we often take for granted - the deliverymen and waste collectors in our community. Rain or shine, these essential workers work hard to make sure we #stayhome and #staysafe. 
Megan recommends some ways we can show our appreciation to essential workers:
- Write a thank-you note - Leave snacks outside your doorways (Twisties, biscuits, candies, etc.)
- Draw them a picture - Bake them a treat (remember to seal it safely so insects do not get to it!)
- Fix up a laminated “thank you” sign outside your door/gate for them (waterproof your signage so the rain will not get to it)
- If you are at home when the essential worker comes, feel free to shout out your appreciation to them in person. Nothing is easier than that. Remember to social distance though!

Join Megan in the SJIIGiveThanks initiative and put a smile on the faces of these essential workers today!
