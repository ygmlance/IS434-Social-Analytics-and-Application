Hi everyone, we hope you’re all doing well! We are 37 days into our extended Circuit Breaker and though it has been trying with all the restrictions we know they are necessary to keep our team and the community safe. We have been in constant telecommunication with our colleagues on mandatory stay home notice and they’re all adapting well despite feeling a little cooped up. Just a few more days till they have a little more wriggle room.

During this time we have continued to do our own R&D and we are getting close to being able to provide you with a new green cleaning alternative for your aircon. We already offer steam cleaning as one of our green offerings but this new one will pack a punch in its own way. 
Stay safe and take care for now everyone!
