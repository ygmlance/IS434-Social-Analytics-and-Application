Was experimenting with #kwongwohhing sauces - Steam Fish Sauce. No, fish was not involved.
.
I figured most already know how to use this sauce on any fish. Spread fish, add Steam Fish Sauce and steam! Simple & Perfect tasting results for anyone. But how about using it with .... mince Pork or Chicken!

KWH Steam Fish Sauce is deliciously unique. Itâ€™s savoury like our Teochew fish sauce but enhanced with sweetness from Plums. Iâ€™m already thinking of new ideas to pair this and I know itâ€™s going to be good.
