Some people like to work really hard and fast, to attain success, on the other hand, there are others who prefer to go slow and cautiously. There is no harm in doing any of the ways; as it, all depends on the personality and habits of an individual. The focus should be on continuous working or be moving to achieve the objectives. You should not give up on your goals, how difficult sometimes it may get, focus only on the goals and be brave to face all odds to achieve them.
