What an awesome hearty meal from W Hotel! 😍⁣
⁣
The beef ribs from SKIRT was slow-cooked for 16 hours and it was juicy, tender and so full of flavour!👍🏻👍🏻 The recipe was passed down from Executive Chef Paolo Sanapo's grandma and hence they named it 'Grandma's Beef Ribs'. There are add-ons of your choice for every order and it also comes with SKIRT’s house-made focaccia bread and signature sauce in a bottle. 😎⁣
⁣
Delivery is free islandwide on the entire cart with any order of beef ribs so we also had a pizza and their house-made burger. Both were absolutely delish too! 😋⁣

Many thanks to @wsingapore for the arrangement! 🙏🏻
