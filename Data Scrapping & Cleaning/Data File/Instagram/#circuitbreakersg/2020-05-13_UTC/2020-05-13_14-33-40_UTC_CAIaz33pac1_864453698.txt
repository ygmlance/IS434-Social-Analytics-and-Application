I was having a craving for their bull frogs so I decided to order delivery on a Saturday afternoon.

I ordered the Dried Chilli Frog ($25) and Ginger Spring Onion Frog ($25). I ordered so much because it was for both lunch and dinner, for the wife and me.

The food was delivered promptly in around 40 minutes, and it was still very warm! The frogs were delicious as usual.

Overall this was a very satisfying meal! Check out link in bio for a list of 20 other Chinese restaurants in Singapore offering islandwide delivery.
