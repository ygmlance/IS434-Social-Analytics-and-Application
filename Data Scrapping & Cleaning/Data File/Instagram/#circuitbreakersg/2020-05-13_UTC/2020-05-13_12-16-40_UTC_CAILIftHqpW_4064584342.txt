3-course Mothers’ Day lunch at home 🥗 🍜 🦐 🍗
Pork shabu udon/somen was a homerun cos it tasted exactly like those in the Japanese restaurants but with triple the meat! The pork shabu was awesome 👏 Chicken and prawns for my awesome helper, who doesn’t take pork 🙂
Made a grocery run to @dondondonkisg for the fresh udon, udon sauce, shabu pork, seaweed toppings and goma salad dressing 🛒
