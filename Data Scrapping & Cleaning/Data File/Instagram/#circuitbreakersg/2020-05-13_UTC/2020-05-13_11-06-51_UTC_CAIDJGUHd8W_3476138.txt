🌈M&M rainbow science experiment🌈 #ThingswedoduringCBperiod😆. This simple experiment requires very little preparation (ok I’m actually using the leftover M&M chocolate at fridge I got fr Yole, and a cup of warm water)适合懒妈妈. 
It’s fun and easy way to teach kids about colour mixing and creating new colours, thanks @yqchen12 for sharing the ideas.❤️#circuitbreakersg #stayhomestaysafe
