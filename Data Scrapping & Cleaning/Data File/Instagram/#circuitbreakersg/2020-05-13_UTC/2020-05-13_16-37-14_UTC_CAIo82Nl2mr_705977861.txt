The New Normal.

That's what's on my mind lately, and I'm sure it's on your mind as well. 
We know that things will never go back to normal when this whole Pandemic ends. What we were used to see/do before might become a thing of the past. Some of which you are already experiencing now.

So how can we navigate through this sudden jump into this new normal? I wish I had a manual with the exact steps of how to do it, but it doesn't exist. The only thing I believe that will help us is this: Being flexibile to changes. .
.
"Change is the only constant in life. Ones ability to adapt to these changes will determine your success in life." .
Like it or not, you will never have complete control towards the changes around the world. But the only thing you can control is YOU. Are you willing to change for the better, or sit there and whine about things not within your control? You decide.

What's your new normal?
