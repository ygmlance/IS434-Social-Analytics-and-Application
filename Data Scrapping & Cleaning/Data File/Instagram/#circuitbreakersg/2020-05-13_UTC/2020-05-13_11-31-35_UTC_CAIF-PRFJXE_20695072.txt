Jaipur, India. 🐘
Watercolour on Paper.

2020 was suppose to be our ‘Comeback Year’ and we were aiming and setting our eyes to go India this year. But GOD have other plans and it may not be a practical and good one, I know that there’s always a bigger purpose for every experience. Still blessed and grateful for it has been an opportunity to widen my craft in this season and for having lots of rest that I didn’t have from grinding for competitions repeatedly throughout the 3 years. It’s a great relief to be able to focus on myself and my craft for once. Still miss the scene of competition though cause it was already in my system. But, let’s see how interesting this year can be (even more so than what is happening around.) for the coming months.
