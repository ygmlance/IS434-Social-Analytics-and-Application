Breakfast Scenes : MOONG DAL CHILA #lentilcrepes 🤤 
These crepes are loaded with all good proteins, vitamins and perfect to kick start your day with it 😀. Made these with yellow lentil, in goes onions, green chillies, ginger, coriander, cumin powder, red chilli powder, turmeric powder and salt as per your taste.
I make these often for my girl who wouldn't eat lentil otherwise, so have it with #greenchutney and #kadakchai☕️.
