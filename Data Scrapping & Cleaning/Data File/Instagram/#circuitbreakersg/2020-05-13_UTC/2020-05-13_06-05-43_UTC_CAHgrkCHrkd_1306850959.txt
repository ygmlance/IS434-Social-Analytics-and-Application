👑We search for happiness everywhere, but we are like Tolstoy’s fabled beggar who spent his life sitting on a pot of gold, begging for pennies from every passerby, unaware that his fortune was right under him the whole time. Your treasure - your perfection - is within you already. 👑 I think our perfection now would be good health for ourselves and our family members and friends. Do keep yourself hydrated with loads of water especially during this hot weather! Today, I’m eating Gardenia banana and walnut bread. The shape of the bread looks like a house so I replicated it into my kind of house- which I used to draw when I was young! 😆 The house must have 2 grilled windows with curtains, a light at the main door, a chimney with 3 bouts of smoke, and a walking path that leads to grass patch with flowers. There will be a smiling sun on the top right corner and some birds flying in the sky. 😌 Is your childhood drawn house similar to mine? Unfortunately in reality, we don’t live in such picture-perfect environment. Nevertheless, we can create our own kind of happiness in our own home- that’s the treasure we are all sitting on (staying in). 🥰 Fyi, today’s creation uses Hersey chocolate, strawberry and butterscotch syrup, green tea milk spread, chocolate rice and blueberries. The most challenging part is actually the smiling sun (Ritz cheese crackers)! 🤣Oh, did you also notice the heart arrow on my Starbucks vanilla latte? This time, I did the coffee stencil art on the dining table directly so it doesn’t dissolve quickly. 😍
