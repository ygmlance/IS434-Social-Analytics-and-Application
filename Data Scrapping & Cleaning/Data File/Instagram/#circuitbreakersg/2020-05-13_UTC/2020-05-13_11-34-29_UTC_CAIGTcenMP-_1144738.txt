Chinese Indonesian restaurant Kota88 (East Coast Road) serves Masakan Tionghoa Indonesia, or Chinese food with touches of Indon flavours. So essentially you’ll get the Indonesian spices and aromatics, with pork (mostly)!
This is the Nasi Campur Babi ($14.88), and has the works - satay, roast pork, a dumpling are some items. The works worked!
And do order the punchy soup baikut ($18.88) with pork ribs and salted vegetable.
They are on the delivery platforms or go to kota88.oddle.me/en_SG!
And thanks for sending the food down! ❤️
