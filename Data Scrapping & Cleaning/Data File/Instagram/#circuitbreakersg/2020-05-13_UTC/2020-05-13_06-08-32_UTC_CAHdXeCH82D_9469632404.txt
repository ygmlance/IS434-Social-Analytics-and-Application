Is your brain working extra hard lately❓ 
Working from home, planning and cooking meals for the family, multitasking between work, house chores and the kiddo’s homework... and sometimes, in the midst of the chaos we just need to hide in the toilet for some “me-time”, sort out our head and a quick catch up with some interesting stuff on Social media.... then we will come back... in the right mind to answer the kiddo’s endless questions again.... 😂
Who is with me? 🙋🏻‍♀️
Hang in there moms❗️ You are not alone❗️We are not superhumanssss
🌟 
To some of us, “me-time” is to sweat it out to stay saint. 
Really⁉️
Yes❗️Exercise is like a happy pill. It releases mood-lifting endorphins. And Endorphins make you HAPPY❗️
Try to have a short workout! Any workout is better than NO workout! It might be your perfect “me-time” too❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️
