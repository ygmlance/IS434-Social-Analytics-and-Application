We know there are quite a number of popular prata places, especially in the Northeast and East areas, but Springleaf is definitely our favourite in the West! We are so glad when they have 3 outlets in the West!

Their pratas are crispy on the outside and yet slightly doughy on the inside. The egg prata is the store's best seller no doubt, with crispy crust and the egg evenly spread out - yums! Other than the usual flavours, they are also known for their speciality pratas - like Plaster Blaster , which is like a prata version of Egg benedict! 
They serve fragrant fish curry and chicken curry to go along with the prata! 😋

PS: They are having offering 15% discount for takeaways! 📍S$1.30 - S$4.00
