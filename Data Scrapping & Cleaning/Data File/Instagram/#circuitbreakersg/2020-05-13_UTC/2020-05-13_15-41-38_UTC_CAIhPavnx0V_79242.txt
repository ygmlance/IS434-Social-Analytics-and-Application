Marinated ramen egg//recipe from @chewsoowei on @heyrozz ig, really love how nice the egg looked. Didnâ€™t manage to follow the recipe exactly as I do not have all the ingredients she used (spring onion & chillies) but it still turned out good. I actually had it marinated for 4 days now as I totally forgot about them in the fridge. Anyways, it is yet another successful attempt!!! Yay!!! #homeywoons #circuitbreakersg
