Darlings! We hear ya. 💗 Due to popular demand, I'll be holding a second round of fundraising via E-MAIL READINGS at $33 SGD per question!⁠
⁠
Just drop us a mail at hello@kellylightworker.com entitled "FUNDRAISING", and include your questions. Once your questions are confirmed (I need to check them to make sure the Tarot will give you a good answer) and payment is made, you'll get your reading via e-mail in 3-5 days.⁠
⁠
For those of you who purchased the $21 SGD tickets but missed the Facebook Live, no worries - just make a top-up payment of $12 SGD and e-mail your question(s). You will also receive an e-mail reading.⁠ All proceeds go to Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), an organisation that cares for our workers in Singapore.

The closing date/time is 1 June 2020 at 11:59 pm. Thank you for your support! 😍🙏🏻
