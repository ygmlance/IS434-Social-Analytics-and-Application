Five simple tips on sun protection of the facial skin🌞
⠀
1️⃣ Don't skimp
Don't try to save the sunscreen products, using a tiny drop of it (especially if the cream is expensive). However, its excess won't be useful as well. For reliable protection, you need a coin-sized ball of the sunscreen product, apply it 20 minutes before sun exposure, so that the chemical filter in its composition has time to "wake up" and start to act⛑.
⠀
2️⃣ Look for the correct letters
Choose broad-spectrum sunscreens that provide protection against UVB and UVA rays (the corresponding abbreviations should be indicated on the package).
⠀
3️⃣ Protect the skin regularly
Cloudy days in the summer are not the reason to do without a day cream with SPF. Moreover, in such weather, the ultraviolet A is especially dangerous, causing severe diseases and contributing to skin aging👵🏻.
⠀
4️⃣ Consult a doctor
High-pressure medications, hormonal birth control pills, and antibiotics increase the sensitivity of the tissues to the sun and boost the risk of burns. In such cases, choose products with the highest possible SPF (not less than 30).
⠀
5️⃣ Soothe the skin
Sometimes in the sun, the face is covered with red spots; this is a microinflammation — a specific reaction to ultraviolet. It's enough to apply a primrose oil on clean skin at night to get rid of it. Due to the high content of gamma-linolenic acid, which restores the water barrier and reduces redness, in the morning, red spots will be gone👋🏻.
⠀
Do not neglect the sun protection, be healthy and forever young🌻
