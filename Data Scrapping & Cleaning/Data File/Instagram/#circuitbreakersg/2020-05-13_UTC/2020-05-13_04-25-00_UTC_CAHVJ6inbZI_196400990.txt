Breakfast today, was “Haam Yu Gai Lup Chow Fan”, or Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice! A Hongkong classic, but without the classic HK flavour, as i didn’t use enough salted fish, and my salted fish was Malaysian... 😬 Tasty, nonetheless! 😋 #haamyugailopchowfan #saltedfishfriedrice #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbreakfast #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
