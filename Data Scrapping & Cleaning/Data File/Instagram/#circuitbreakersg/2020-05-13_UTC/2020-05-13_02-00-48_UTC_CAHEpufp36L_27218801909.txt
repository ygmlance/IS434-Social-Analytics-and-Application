To all our treasured shoppers, we are taking additional precautionary measures to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all during this period of time. 
Tekka Place has implemented Contact Tracing by using SafeEntry* at our entrances recently. Personal data will be collected via SafeEntry from all shoppers entering the mall, for the purpose of contact tracing matters related to COVID-19. Please read about the latest safety guidelines with our handy infographic! 
Community cases are going down, but we must not get complacent! We hope for your cooperation during this tough time. ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª *SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system which logs visits by individuals to venues providing essential services. Find out more from here https://safeentry.gov.sg/
