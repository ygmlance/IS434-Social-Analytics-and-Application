Homemade chicken collagen broth from chicken bones and feet. Refrigerate overnight, next day remove the solidified fats on the surface 🥴.
After heating up the broth, remove chicken bones and feet, set aside. 
I boiled dumplings, vegs, la mian noodles straight in the broth.
Lastly, shred off any meat from the chicken bones and use as garnish, chicken feet eat as appetiser. 🤓
