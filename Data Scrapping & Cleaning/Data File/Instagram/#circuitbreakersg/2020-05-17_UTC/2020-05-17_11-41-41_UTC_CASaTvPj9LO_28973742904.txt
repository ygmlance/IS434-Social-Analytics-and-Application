Weekend grocery shopping and these beautiful Hamaguri clams caught my eyes. They definitely gave me the idea of cooking vongole for tonightâ€™s dinner as it has been a long time since I last cooked this fish. OMG! These plump clams are packed with sweet and umami flavours.
.
Tip: Butter is the secret ingredient for my vongole recipe. I usually add butter with olive oil to heat up the garlic and chili flakes and another dollop after I stir in the cooked spaghetti. More butter please! ðŸ˜‹
