17 May 20 :: Day 41 of CB #circuitbreakersg. #sgunited #stayhomesg and #je55cooks purple sweet potato #OndehOndeh to satisfy own craving. 🍠
.
I did them 皮薄馅多。In the end, some of these furry balls break as it cooks, with palm sugar flowing out. 😭#BallsExpanded. The dough was too thin!

For those good ones, I am able to bite into it and enjoy a burst of goodness in my mouth! #爆浆

Ingredients ::
150g purple sweet potato, shaved and cut into chunks
50g glutinous rice flour
100g grated coconut (I steamed with a little salt and pandan leaf)
80g gula Melaka, shaved

Method ::
Steam the sweet potato until soft and mash into paste.

Add in glutinous rice flour and some water and knead into a smooth dough. Adjust the water accordingly to the texture of the dough.

Roll dough into 20g balls. Flatten and put some shaved gula melaka in the centre. Seal and roll into smooth balls.

Cook in a pot of simmering boiled water until the balls float up. 
Once cooked, drain and coat with the grated coconut.

I like the texture of the Ondeh Ondeh better when they have completely cooled down. Pop the whole thing in the mouth for a totally clean enjoyment.
