ðŸ¥£CB Day41 - Dinner TimeðŸ¥£
.
FoodPanda my dinner tonight, coz I'm really sick of any form of meal with rice or noodles.
.
Craving for some sourish and spicy food, hence ordered this Tom Yum Soup from #chiangmaithaikitchen at Bukit Merah. .
The soup taste fine, no complaint about that. The only part is... ... I've selected "clear soup" & requested for "No Prawns" .
So you can see from the photo, obviously the soup is not "clear" & it came with prawns... ... I've to scoop away and gave it to my brother.
.
I wonder did they see the remarks (since FoodPanda App) gave me all the selections and request comment box. I've given this place a lower rating and send my feedback to them. They should be glad that my allergy to prawns is a mild one, if not likely they might have to pay for my hospital bill then! ðŸ™„
