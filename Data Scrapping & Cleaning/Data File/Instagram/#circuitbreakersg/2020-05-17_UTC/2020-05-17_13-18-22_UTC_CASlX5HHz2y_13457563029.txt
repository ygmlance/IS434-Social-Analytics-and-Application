I’ve been thinking of ways to help my children discover the many languages of love, and I refuse to go into the technicality. 💕Because, the beauty is in discovering its essence.
.
These are some of the books we are currently reading and I wanna give you a quick run through.
.
🌿 最棒的礼物 is a translation from Annette LeBox’s Peace is an Offering. It is an absolutely beautiful book about kindness and empathy. The poetic verses tug on tenderness of your heart and the illustrations bear the sweetest details. You’ll discover how easy it is to offer comfort and love; companionship and laughter.
.
🌿 If you’ve been following me, you’ll discover that I really love a good rhyming book on love. 宝贝 就是这样爱你 is so well-translated that I actually enjoyed the chinese version better. My little girl always asks for a cuddle when we read this - in her own words, “Mummy, when you read this, my heart feels good.” This comes in a series of 5 books, and each is a beautiful declaration of adoration!
.
🌿 Guess How Much I Love You needs little introduction. The verses are so iconic, and the lines so sweet, even my baby boy could identify it the moment he hears the opening line🥰.
.
Swipe ⬅️ for more. The third picture is my girl’s absolute favourite page from 晚安 我的宝贝 🥰 It makes her laugh so much because she thinks it reminds her of bath time with 👶🏻 !

🕊Have a wonderful and peaceful evening, my friends.
