Day 13 Hols = Day 41 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Full Body stretch and Recovery
#7dayhomeworkoutchallenge with #heatherrobertsoncom 
Today's Heather Robertson's challenge ends with a wonderful stretch and recovery. That is what I need! So glad that I made it and also still had time to do more on my own and continue my strength training.

Glad to complete this 7 day challenge! 
My personal fitness goal is to have my muscle percentage more than my fat percentage. Its not easy to achieve as I also wish my weight will go down.. So, I'm still working on it as much as I can now! 
Enjoy your Sunday people!
