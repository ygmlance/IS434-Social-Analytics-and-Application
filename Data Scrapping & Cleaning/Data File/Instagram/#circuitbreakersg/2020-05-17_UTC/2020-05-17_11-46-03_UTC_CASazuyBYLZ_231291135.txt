Another successful day with Health Promotion Board team to get the preschool teachers back to teaching as safely as possible. The full scale of this operations should not to be underestimated. Tests need time to be processed and communicated to tens of thousands of school staff. It's not possible for it to be done like 1 or 2 days before the actual day of school reopening. The entire operation is going to take almost 2 weeks to be able to reach all school staff. Also, wearing the face shield has left that bump line on my forehead (the surgical mask is covering the lines left by N95 on my face). If only I can wear my paintball mask and headband... 😁😁 #nyp #hpb #moh #circuitbreakersg #covid19 #ilovesingapore #singapore #imisspaintball #womeninsports
