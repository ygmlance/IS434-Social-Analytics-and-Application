【Recipe】Salmon in red curry gravy served over Cilantro lime multigrain rice. And a very refreshing big Pineapple and herb salad to go with the fish curry rice. 
Something light since we had a late breakfast. And since I bought a fresh pineapple, using it to make a salad sounds about perfect for this warm afternoon. 
I used my own homemade curry paste to cook with the salmon. You can get the recipe at the first post on this tag #honeybeecookscurrychicken 
I love the Cilantro lime rice! Pairing it with seafood is perfect. #honeybeecookscilantrolimerice

Check out my IGS to see how I whipped up this lunch. #honeybeecookssimplelunch
