🤖🤖 Illustrator Working From Home no. 12🤖🤖
“旺旺Spot. Hello Spot”: watercolour on cold-pressed paper.
🐕 🐶 🐕 
Who said Spot is “dystopian”?😂
( @stephencolbertlateshow : Not me!😅) Well, at least Kit Cat is finding Spot the robo-dog at AMK-Bishan Park kind of cool😉
No, Otti! Stop poking Spot! And if you are feeling frighten by Spot like Poppy does, MoMo is here to protect you!🤗
Well, Spot is not that scary at all; she’s here to spread important reminder to park users. Next time if you meet her at the park, do wave hello to her, just remember to observe safe distancing, ok?😉
