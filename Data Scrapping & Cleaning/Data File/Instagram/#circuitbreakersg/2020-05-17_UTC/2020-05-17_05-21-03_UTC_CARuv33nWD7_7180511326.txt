Together, We Are Sound 
It’s challenging times now, more so for some than others.

As mental wellness practitioners, we are acutely aware that the current Covid-19 pandemic may affect your mental well-being in many ways and can have a heavier toll on some of us who have anxiety, depression or other conditions.

Stay Sound – Feel Positive – Support a Cause
🎧
Today, we are launching our debut sound healing audio clip 🎧 – “Sounds for a Quiet Mind”, which can help you unwind, feel more positive😄 and sleep better💤. Listen to it whenever you need a break and some self-love. 💗

And it is our pleasure 🥰 to collaborate on this initiative with @samhsingapore, Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) to raise funds to support the rising demand for mental health services during the Covid-19 period. With your donation, we aim to raise 💲1️⃣5️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ by 21 June 2020.🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️💪🤝

Mental wellness is a collective effort🤝. Your mental well-being affects others in the same way that how they are coping, affects you too.
