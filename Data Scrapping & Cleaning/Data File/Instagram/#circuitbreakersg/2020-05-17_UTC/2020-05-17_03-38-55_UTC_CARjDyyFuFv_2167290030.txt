Day 40, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
HAM SANDWICH
🥪🥪🥪🥪🥪🥪🥪
Breakfast in the balcony again, with the beautiful rain. Yes, my balcony has a good view to the tennis court. I get to see some good matches sometime 😁

Easy sandwich. Just chopped some ham, onion, capsicum, tomato, coriander & mixed some cheese to it. Put some ketchup and spices on the slice of bread, put the filling, toasted the sandwich. Done!
