Things to do with the kids #58

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Safe seating, I think you'd agree?" "Vanilla, I'm taking my early morning nap. I did my Caruso practice at 5am." "And I practised furball ejection at 3am, Titus, so there's no excuse." "Excuse for what? You don't expect me to exercise this morning do you?" #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
