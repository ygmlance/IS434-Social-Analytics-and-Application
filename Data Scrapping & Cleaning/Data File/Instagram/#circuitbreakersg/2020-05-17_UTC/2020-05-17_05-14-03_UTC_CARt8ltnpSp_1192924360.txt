Used up the frozen pork balls in the fridge from @maxzi.sg for this. Made a mushroom roux sauce to go with the pork balls and a side of mash potatoes whipped with French butter. No lingonberry sauce so I substituted with cranberry sauce. #treeblackcatskitchen #covidcooking #meatballs #homecook #homecooking #sghomecook #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakercooking #noikeanoproblem #mashpotatoes #roux #mushroomgravy #mushroomsauce #sghomecooking #homecooked #cookingathome
