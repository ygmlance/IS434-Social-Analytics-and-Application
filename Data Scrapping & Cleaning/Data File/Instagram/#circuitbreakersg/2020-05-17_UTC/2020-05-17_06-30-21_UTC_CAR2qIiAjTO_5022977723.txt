For some the lockdown has increased our attention towards our skin care routine, but not for our make-up routine. Since we spend most of our time home, why is there a need to use make-up anyway…⁠
.⁠
However, for some of us zoom calls or video meetings have become a norm every morning and if you need just one make-up product to give you fresh and flawless skin – it has to be a tinted moisturizer.⁠ Here are some recommendations; ⁠
.⁠
1 – Bobbi Brown BB Cream⁠
.⁠
2 - First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Tint Cream⁠
.⁠
3 - NARS Velvet Matte Skin Tint⁠
.⁠
4 - Shiseido Synchro Skin Tinted Gel Cream⁠
.⁠
5 – Pixi Tinted Gel Cream ⁠
