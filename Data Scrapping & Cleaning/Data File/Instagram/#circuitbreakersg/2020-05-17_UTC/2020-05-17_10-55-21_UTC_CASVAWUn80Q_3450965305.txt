Today, the boy wrote a full page of small "a" !!! And he improved a lot! (Swipe to see his writing when he first started and how much he's progressed!) So proud of him that he's able to write the letter "a" now free hand without me guiding him! Moving onto the next letter tonight!!! We are going slowly and nope, no printed worksheets or such from the school... We didn't buy any either! Just plain old writing with 2B pencils and a writing pad!
.
.Progressing slowly but it's okay:) As long as we keep going and practicing! Not gonna expect a lot from this boy because just by sitting down and writing free-hand on his own, I'm already satisfied! And he did good! 加油 baobei!!!
.
.
.P.S Took me a lot a lot of effort, guidance, time and practicing with him, nearly weeks.... Just to get this okay?? He's not a genius, and I'm definitely not one too! .
