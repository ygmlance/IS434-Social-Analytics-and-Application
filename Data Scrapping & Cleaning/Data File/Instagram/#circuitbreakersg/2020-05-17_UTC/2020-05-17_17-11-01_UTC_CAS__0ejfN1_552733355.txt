Well, for who might curious why Iâ€™m so craving for bubble tea, because during the circuit breaker in Singapore, we are not allowed to buy any bubble tea anymore, including delivery. All outlets are closed. 
But then, they collaborated with other restaurants, which still able to sell their food online. Hmmm so we have here, bubble teaaaaaa ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜† Okay so quarantine day ??? cannot remember anymore ðŸ˜†
