♣︎ Breakfast idea ♣︎ Ham and egg toast

Breakfast can be just as simple with these
🧀🍳🥓🥒
I use Bruno Toaster Grill from @brunohotplatesg that has upper and lower heating function separately.

Even though this is served within 10 minutes, I am quite fussy about my breakfast so have optimized it to the texture I like. Of course you can just put everything into a toaster and start toasting right from the beginning because the overall duration is short so it wouldn’t go too wrong.

I like to my bread to be more toasted and I usually keep my bread in fridge, so here’s my way

❶ put some water in the water tray and on the lower heating function to heat up bread. Heat up oil for egg later and slice Japanese cucumber while heating. This will take about 2 minutes.
❷ fry sunny side egg
❸ while frying, turn bread to the other side and add slice Japanese cucumber and ham on the toasted side. On the upper and lower heating function together and toast for 1-2 minutes
❹ add cheese slice on to the toast. Off the lower heating function and continue for 30 seconds. The cheese melts quite fast.
❺ sunny side up egg is ready by now and it is good to serve!
