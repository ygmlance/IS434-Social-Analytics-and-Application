Pandan ondeh ondeh with Sweet Potato and mum's secret filling. Most are sold with just Gula melaka filling but mom like it with some texture and crunchiness and this is the kind of ondeh ondeh (size too) that I have grown up on. Finally made this and this will go into I-can-make-this-myself-dish. #circuitbreakersg day29 #ibonappetit #mylollybellykitchen #isocooking #isolationbaking #isolife #lockdowncooking
