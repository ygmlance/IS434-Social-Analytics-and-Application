When you feel like korean fried chicken after a k-drama marathon
.
Yes, must pair it with a k-beer too (set came with a can of Coke not beer haha)
.
It was our first time trying @shakeshakeinatub after seeing @joanne_ho_wee posted. Fresh tender chicken flesh, crispy on the outside. We took a 20 pc combo meal ($24.70); chose 16 Soya and 4 Spicy (for the adults). Many flavours of the french fries to choose from too; we had the Truffles (safest bet)
.
.
Sinfully good and we know we will be back soon when the craving sets in
