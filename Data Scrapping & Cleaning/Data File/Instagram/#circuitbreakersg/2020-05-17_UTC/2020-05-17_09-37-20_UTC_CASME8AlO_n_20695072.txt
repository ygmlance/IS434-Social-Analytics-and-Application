Having so much fun trying out my new pastel watercolour set that I decided to try out a stylised portrait inspired by Ana Santos’s Illustration Portraits since she’s using the same palette set. Limiting myself to only mostly pastels was a challenge because I have a very saturated and vibrant work. But it was fun learning how to do this since I love this aesthetic style. soft and whimsical.
