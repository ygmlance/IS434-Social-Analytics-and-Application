💖Salmon Tomato Pasta💖

Salmon was so flaky soft and pink. Like sous vide. 😍 
Tomato pasta was al dente also. Sauce was light and tangy with some chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Could do more sauce to coat the pasta. 
Was so intrigued when I saw “prune spiced root vegetables” so choose it as a side for my BYO meal. Was afraid it would be glazed in some overly sweet sauce but it wasn’t! It is crunchy chopped radish with soft chopped carrot and purple sweet potato with mild sweetness. Can’t taste that there is prune though but it was nice and light. 
Caramelised eggplant was soft and not too sweet as well. 👍
Don’t forget to add on their soft boiled egg if you BYO meal. Swipe left to see the perfect gooey golden centre. 😍
