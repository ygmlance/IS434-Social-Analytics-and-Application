Day 41 of #stayhomesg #circuitbreakersg *
I have knitted more body parts. I’m starting to regret knitting this pattern. There’s going to be an enormous amount of seaming. Also, because it’s knitted flat, there’s a lot of purling. I purl in a weird way so now my left wrist is sore.

The knitted ones are playing with the body parts. I’d better finish the doll quickly.
