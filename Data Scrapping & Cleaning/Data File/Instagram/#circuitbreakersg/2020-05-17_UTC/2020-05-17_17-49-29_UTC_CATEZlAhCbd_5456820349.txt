Step 1: Mix these ingredients in a small pot until melted.
1/3 cup butter
1 packet instant 3 in 1 coffee
3/4 cup fresh milk
50g choc (i used dark choc, but u can choose ur own type)
1/2 cup brown sugar (i find it sweet so u can lessen the sugar if u prefer less sweet to mayby 1/3)

Step 2: Sift and mix the ingredients.
3/4 cup self-raising flour
1 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tsp salt

Step 3: 
Mix all the ingredients(from step 1 and 2) in one bowl.
Add 1 tsp vanilla essense
Add 3 tbsp of nutella
Add 1/2 cup almond slices

Step 4:
Pour mixture in metal tray. (With baking paper)
Add toppings(I used either almomd slices or Lotus Biscuit crumbs.) Step 5:
Preheat air-fryer for 5 mins.
Temperature: 180 celcius
Duration:10 -15 min (depends on how deep is the metal dish/tray)

Start with 10min first. Check by using a toothpick or fork and poke through. The fork should be clean, no batter should stick to it. Add on another 5 mins if needed.
