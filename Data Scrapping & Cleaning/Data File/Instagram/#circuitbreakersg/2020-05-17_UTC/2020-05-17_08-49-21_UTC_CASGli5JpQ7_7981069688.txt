Kenny Dorham - This Is The Moment!, 1957. Following on with another vocal album but this was one I did not expect. This is the only album that hard-blowing Kenny Dorham sings on, in the same style that Chet Baker took. His voice is not bad and the arrangements on the album makes this an easy album to put on on a Sunday afternoon. #cedarwalton makes his recording debut on this album.  #kennydorham #thisisthemoment #curtisfuller #samjones #charliepersip #riversiderecords
