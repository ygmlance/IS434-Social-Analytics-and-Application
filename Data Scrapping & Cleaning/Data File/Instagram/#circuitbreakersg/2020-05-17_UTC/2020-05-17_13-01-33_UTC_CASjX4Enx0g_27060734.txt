Welcome to highlights of the coverage of... my room.

[GIVEAWAY] - Because I want to feel like an influenza 😂😂
As the CB lockdown comes to an end soon in two weeks here in Singapore, my heartfelt thanks goes out to all of you who have given precious support for my crazy socially-distanced films during this difficult period, via DMs or through other ways. There would be 2x $20 Grab vouchers (for rides only; validity till August) available! Just leave in the comments any book title you’ve spotted in this film. 2 followers would be selected using a random number generator on Thursday evening 🙂 Thank you 🙏🏾🙏🏾
(for friends who are located in Singapore only, sorry...)
