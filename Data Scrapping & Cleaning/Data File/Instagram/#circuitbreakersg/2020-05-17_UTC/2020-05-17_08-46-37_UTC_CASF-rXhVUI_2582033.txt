I love the fact that SAGAF special blended Spices is Super versatile that I can cook so many dishes with it - thus cooking Soto Ayam is such a breeze thank goodness! 
You donâ€™t need so much time to cook this broth .. just like how you cook any kind of soup ! 
I used Ceker Ayam (Chicken Feet) from the many whole chicken bought from the market , set aside weekly ,  till I have one good bowl ready to make chicken stock . Soto Ayam will be more flavourful with it if you are not using the whole chicken .

Plus point - Chicken feet provide a surprising amount of health benefits ! Chicken feet are not only rich in collagen but also a good source of hyaluronic acid ðŸ˜…

Full recipe is up !
