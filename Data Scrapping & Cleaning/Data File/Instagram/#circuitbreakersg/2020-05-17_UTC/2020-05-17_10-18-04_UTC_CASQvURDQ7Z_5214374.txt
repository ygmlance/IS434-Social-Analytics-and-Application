Circuit Breaker Day 41
Watercolour painting
Using a photo from @yasuto.photography as a reference and practice. (I did pm him for permission but I had.gotten no reply. In any case, if it is not allowed, I will pull this down.) Anyway,  Day 41 was plagued with multiple toilet trips, insomnia naps and reading.  So, had to try to get out of bed to do something with my hands.
