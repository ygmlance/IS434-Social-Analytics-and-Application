Tried a new recipe for Steamed Cod Fish and I think Iâ€™ll be sticking to this one from now on. 
It involves rubbing a bit of cooking wine all over the fish before steaming it with a sprig of spring onion and ginger, then pouring away the water from the steamed fish before pouring over a mixture of soy sauce, oyster sauce, a bit of sugar, water and cooking wine. And add some panfried garlic bits to top it off!

I always used to add my seasoning and toppings over the fish and just steam together coz itâ€™s easier and saves time. However thereâ€™s always sort of a fishy smell though it doesnâ€™t really bother us. So now I know, the key is to throw away the steamed fish water then pour the sauce over.
