Day 39. Thought I would miss out a beautiful view as I woke up at 7am. A surprise awaited me. Had omelette for breakfast. Lunch - Mr. cooked braised pork rice #卤肉饭, with tau kwa and ramen eggs. One of the best lunch we had during this period. Evening skys are getting more colourful nowadays. Two more weeks before Missy goes back to school! #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #homecookedmeal #realfood #instadaily
