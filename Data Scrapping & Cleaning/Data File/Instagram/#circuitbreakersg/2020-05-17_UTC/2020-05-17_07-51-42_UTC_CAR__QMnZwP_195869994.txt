🌟 GIVEAWAY 2 years subscription worth $288🌟

Recently, we checked out this interactive and engaging home-based Math learning software for all primary school children, @koobits. Check out the highlights in my profile.

When I heard Vera's request to do more, it meant that she gained the confidence and was motivated to do more sums, not forgetting to factor in FUN because after completing each challenge, she was rewarded with KOKO coins and get to redeem for some #MomApproved game time! Parents, don't worry, I hear you! The game time is only limited to 30 mins a day and no late night gaming as #Koobits encourage the kids to have early nights too!

With the A.I. and Big Data technology utilised by the platform, I can actually monitor through Koobits, Parent App which provides insights into both Xav and Vera's learning progress in real time.

Hey parents, if you are like me who believes in a balance of work and play this holiday, especially for your child who is weaker in Math, you can redeem your FREE KooBits Weekly Homework Service (KooBits HBL Lite* included worth $60/year) here »⁣
