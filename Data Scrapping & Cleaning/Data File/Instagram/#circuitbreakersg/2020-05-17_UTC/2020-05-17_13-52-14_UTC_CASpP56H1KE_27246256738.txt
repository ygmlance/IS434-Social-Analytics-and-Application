| Rainbow above the Cloud - 云☁️ | ⁣

“我把彩虹放在云彩中，作我与大地立约的记号。”⁣ 创世记‬ ‭9:13‬ ‭‬‬⁣
“I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.”⁣ Genesis‬ ‭9:13‬ ⁣

Since March last year, we started using Chinese book readers with my #5yo daughter. @sagebookshkasia is one of our fav ones that my little one has slowly built her confidence in reading. But as a working mom during this #circuitbreakersg, it is challenging to cope with all tasks at home without a helper. And sometimes, my daughter likes to pick other books in the same series 🧐⁣
⁣
But just a few days ago, we re-visited back to this book again. Here is her craftwork for the 云 character. ⁣
⁣
Materials need:⁣
Paper plate⁣
Cotton balls/Cotton Pads⁣
Markers⁣
⁣
In our next posting, we will share about 小麦的故事 - kids conversation starter about sharing God’s love. This is inspired by the conversation stories between my young daughter and her friends in school and related to this 云 character 🙂⁣
