Pulled an all nighter to cope with all the cakes. Before I knew it, dawn cracked. ⁣

So I whipped up a braakfast for champions after I was done baking! ⁣
⁣
Freshly done scrambled eggs anointed with spring onions since no chives at home, rosemary ham slices, beech wood smoked salmon, cream cheese, onion loaf, and allow washed down with fresh OJ and a cuppa. ⁣
⁣
We ate, holding hands. ⁣
