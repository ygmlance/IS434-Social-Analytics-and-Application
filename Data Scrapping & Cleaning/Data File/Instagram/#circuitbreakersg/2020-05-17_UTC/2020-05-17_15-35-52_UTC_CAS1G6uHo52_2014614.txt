𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟒𝟏 - Edible pebbles, anyone? ⁣
⁣
It’s #WorldBakingDay today so I baked goma cookies for #teabreak using @hvala_sg’s 𝐆𝐨𝐦𝐚 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐁𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐊𝐢𝐭. Priced at $18, the baking kit will be available for purchase on their website from Tuesday, 19 May onwards! ⁣⁣

I like how fuss-free it is! All you need is 110g butter to mix the contents from the kit using an electric mixer, shape the cookies and bake for 12 mins at 180C. It’s that simple! The cookies are really very yummy! Very fragrant! 很香!⁣⁣

PS: I got OCD when it comes to baking, so I weigh the dough to ensure the cookies are of the same size! My goma cookies are 12g each & I managed to make 32.5 cookies! ⁣⁣
