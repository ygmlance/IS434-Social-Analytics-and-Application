First time seeing a Siamese banana. Took me a few days to get this one going, before the brown spots started showing up. But I heard from Spoon University that:
Yellow, ripe bananas are easier to digest because the resistant starch changed to a simple sugar. Bananas also obtain higher levels of antioxidants as they ripen. Fully ripened bananas produce a substance called Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF). This gives ripe bananas anti-cancer qualities as they combat abnormal cells in your body. With more age and dark patches, the banana has a higher immunity enhancement quality.
