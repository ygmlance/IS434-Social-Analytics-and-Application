<Birthday Reflection>

Celebrated my 35th Birthday a few days ago in the safety and comforts of our home amidst Circuit Breaker. Completely different from the atas dinner for my 30th. Much of it has to do with the current circumstances as the only dine-in option is at home ðŸ˜€

However, the older I get, the more I value the simple things in life. 14th May 2020 was more than I could ever hope for. I am blessed to have friends who never fail to send me their best wishes year after year, buddies who go through the effort to make my day packed by sending me surprise deliveries (this is the best chance to surprise me as I have a rich history of sniffing and foiling surprises), mom and brothers who still treat me like the youngest in the family (I will always be), nephews and niece who loves singing birthday songs in 3 languages, and a wife who loves me as much as I love her. Thank you for creating the best birthday cake I've ever had. And also for accepting my imperfections. ðŸ˜˜

Looking back, much has changed since no 30. I got promoted twice, proposed to my ex-girlfriend, got married, moved into our first home, and my dad whom I love very much passed on. My solace is that he witnessed me graduate, build a career, get married and grow into a fairly decent adult. Thank you for being my biggest role model.

Looking forward, I am excited and fully prepared to embrace what's in store for the 2nd half of my 30s. I will stay true to living a whole and meaningful life. Things will not always be ideal or perfect, but I'm totally committed for the ride with my life partner @peihuangkuan beside me all the way, for better or for worse. ðŸ˜€

Finally, here's wishing everyone a good last 2 weeks of Circuit Breaker. May you all stay safe and healthy as we move on to the new normal. We will get out of this stronger!
