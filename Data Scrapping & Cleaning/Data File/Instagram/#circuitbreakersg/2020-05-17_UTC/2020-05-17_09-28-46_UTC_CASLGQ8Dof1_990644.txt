2 different soups that look similar. One is tomyam soup. The other tomato soup. One for adults. One for the kid. Big prawns shells from the prawns that the wife used to make prawn stock. From the prawn stock + Tom Yam paste = adult soup. Prawn stock + canned tomato soup = kid’s soup. Shhh. It’s Campbell Tomato Soup (coz she says Heinz is the healthiest on label, but out of stock. She spent a long time checking before CB started. Not the HDL ones coz the grandparents think we used that. Think grandparents are thinking about HDL!!)
