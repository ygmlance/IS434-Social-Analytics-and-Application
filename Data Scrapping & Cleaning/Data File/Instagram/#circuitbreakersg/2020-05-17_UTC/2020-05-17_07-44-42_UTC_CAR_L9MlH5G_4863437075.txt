滑蛋伊面...classic zichar order! My grandma makes really yummy ones and I miss hers very much. I didn't have any squid so I used Batang fish slices from @9sseafood and some sliced pork shoulder. Topped with fried shallots & pork lard. I don't like giving wheat noodles to B because I prefer he goes gluten-free at home. But yee mee is not the same if we don't use yee mee. #zichar #homemade #homecooked #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeandcook #yeemee #healthyish
