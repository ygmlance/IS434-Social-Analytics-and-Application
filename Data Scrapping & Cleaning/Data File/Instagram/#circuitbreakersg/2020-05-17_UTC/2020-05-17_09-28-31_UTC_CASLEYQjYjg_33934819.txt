Well, cafe hopping is impossible during this #CircuitBreakerSG So, we go for grocery store hopping 🛍️🛒🛍️🛒🛍️🛒
Found my new favourite eco friendly, vegan friendly and healthy wholefoods store! 💚💚💚
Food range here is huge, from various type of flour, rice, beans, seeds, nuts, plant based milk, oil, herbs, etc.
They even have home care/ household products, skin care, hair care, body care 😱
Bring your own jar/bottle to scoop your necessity. Bring your own grocery bag too. No single plastic is used here 👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
