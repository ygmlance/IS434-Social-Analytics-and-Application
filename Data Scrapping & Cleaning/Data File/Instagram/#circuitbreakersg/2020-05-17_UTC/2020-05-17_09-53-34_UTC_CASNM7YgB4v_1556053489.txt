When tennis times are tough. Poor strokes aside I’m more working on my breathing technique, exhaling when I “strike” the ball. Running out of oxygen is a real problem for me when I play!... at 5kg lighter than the last time I played (2+ months ago) cannot wait to be back on the court! #tennis #offcourt #breathing #sport #visualisation #exercise #lockdown #circuitbreaker  #circuitbreakersg #singapore
