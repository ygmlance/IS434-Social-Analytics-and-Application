“I would've stayed at home, 'cause I was doin' better alone... I should've stayed at home, 'cause now there ain't no letting you go”... as Dua Lipa sings... 🎤 🎶 🎵 .
Here’s a toast to another stay home weekend! Hope it’s not too toasty at home with the current hot and humid weather here in 🇸🇬. Have a sip of sunshine 🌞, and all you need for brunch is one pan 🍳and some simple ingredients from the fridge at home!
.
Brunch on Monday: Cannot decide between wrap or prata? How about one-pan prata egg wrap 🍳🌯with ham 🍖, mozzarella cheese 🧀, white onion 🧅 and butterhead lettuce 🥗 + soft baked egg in avocado 🍳🥑, pictured here with the hubs’ palm sized apple pies 🍎🥧
.
The prata wrap passed the hubs’ review and he actually thinks it’s good enough for sale... 🥱 best part is it’s super easy and quick! Super filling too. .
Throwback to another earlier weekend: our mini competition and attempts at one-pan egg toast (watched too much Tik Tok 🤣 and reminds me of Korean toast) - the one on the right is the hubs’ and honestly, it tasted better because he improvised with the prep ingredients meant for dinner (honeyed onion and apple slices)🤪... the one in the middle is mine which he thinks it’s neater and the one on the extreme left was the disastrous first attempt by the serious hubs 🤓😅🤭 (the hubs de-constructed the ingredients for his second try, while I re-grilled the toast and coincidentally plated the word 「人」 with avocado slices, telling us to 「做人要知足常樂」?) 😇
