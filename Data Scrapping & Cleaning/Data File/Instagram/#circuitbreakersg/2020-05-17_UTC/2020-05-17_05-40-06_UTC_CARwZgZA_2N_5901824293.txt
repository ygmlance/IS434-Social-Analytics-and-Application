In this shoulder bridge variation with your shoulders propped up into a reverse tabletop, the focus shifts from spinal articulation to trunk & pelvic lumber stabilization
Engage those abdominals and watch out for any lumbar/ thoracic extension 
Feel your glutes burn as you hold this bridge for some lifts & pulses
Stack on the weight for more fun (advancement is fun!)
