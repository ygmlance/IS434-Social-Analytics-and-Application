Today is Learning Plants Day and we did #terrariums 🌿🌱 During these 2 months of staying in, I'm glad these boys have each other for company. They do fight and squabble (almost daily 😱) like most siblings do but end of day, they learn, have fun and do almost everything together ❤ Hope they will always remember this period when time goes by.  #brotherlylove #theleebrothers #babyelijahlee #izzypeasylee #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeactivities #lilcubs
