My signature Marmee Ultimate Gourmet Burger! Home made from burger bun to my beef patty & fries😄😘 🍔 making sure the stacking is correct. Lettuce, patty, cheese, tomato. I got greedy, added Onions, Mushrooms & Avocado 🤣
Can you believe it, NTUC ran out of frozen fries!😩 Got some potatoes and made my own hahaha 🙏👍 YUM 😜
