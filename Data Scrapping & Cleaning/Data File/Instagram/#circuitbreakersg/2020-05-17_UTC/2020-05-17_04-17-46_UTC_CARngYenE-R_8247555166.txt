Breakfast with homemade Swiss rolls, consisting of 2 flavours. One for Mum and one for me! 😜
✨
For Mum - Vanilla roll cake with whipped condensed milk chantilly. Mum always likes her cakes in good old plain flavours, and as she always likes condensed milk, I decided to reduce the amount of sugar and replace it with condensed milk for the whipped chantilly. It turned out to be so good and milky and most importantly, Mum really loves it! 🥛

For me - Valrhona chocolate roll cake with whipped milo chantilly with Valrhona dark chocolate crunchy pearls. Love how smooth the milo chantilly is with its mousse like texture. Also like the subtle malty taste and it’s such a perfect match to the Valrhona chocolate elements. The crunchy pearls are seriously the best, especially in whipped chantilly! They’re so addictive that I always have to resist eating them on their own! 🍫

Mum’s Swiss rolls plated in round coupe plate in navy from @luzerneglobal’s Knit collection. Guess this’ll be my last entry for their contest, since it’s the closing date today. Always enjoy baking for Mum as she loves cakes a lot! As much as the fact that we are very close, our taste preferences differ completely in some areas. One of them is chocolate, which’s my ❤️ but not hers. Thus I’ll try to do 2 flavours if I can to cater to her preferences as well as mine. Enjoyed joining in the fun but actually even without the contest I’ll still be baking for her heheh. Think my tableware has been really well used this CB. Time to get more after the CB! 😂 #stayhomewithluzerne
