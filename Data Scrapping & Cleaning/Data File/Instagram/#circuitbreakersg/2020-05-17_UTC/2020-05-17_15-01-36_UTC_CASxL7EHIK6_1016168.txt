#Circuitbreakersg day 41

Pasta two ways coz itâ€™s than than one ?

Dinner today : ðŸ”º Lasagne with beef in red wine & home-made tomato sauce. It was moist & every mouthful was sweet & salty with the right amount of cheese. ðŸ”ºSeafood penne alla vodka, yup.
With vodka of course. I think I was too generous so it turned a bit bitter but everything was alrite coz I just had to boil
until it dissipates. ~
