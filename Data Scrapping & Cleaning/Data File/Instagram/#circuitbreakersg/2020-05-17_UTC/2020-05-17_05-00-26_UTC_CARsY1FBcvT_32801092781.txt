Circuit breaker Day 41: Western food from @chefchoosignature at Golden Mile food centre 👍👍👍 Favourite western store in SG, restaurant standards at hawker prices! Soooooo good, all this for $28.80! Pork chop on garlic rice or aglio olio both veryyy good. Aglio olio amongst the best around. Garlic rice is real unique & so delicious(I’m someone that doesn’t love garlic) but it really elevates the dish. The special dish today was good too, Jap scallops spaghetti with spicy garlic white wine tomato sauce. Can only sing praises about this store. It might be my fav also because it’s right opposite @kopi_more 😅(no pic today) aka best kopi in SG!
