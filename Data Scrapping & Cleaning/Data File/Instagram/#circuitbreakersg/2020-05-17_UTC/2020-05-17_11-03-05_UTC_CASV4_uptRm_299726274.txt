Roasted chicken leg with lemon, garlic and thyme. Served with roasted asparagus, zucchini and potatoes. One tray to cook, one plate to serve. My only gripe is that the chicken legs in Singapore are way too small compared to the ones sold in Malaysia. #dinner #sundayroast #roastedchicken #stayathome #circuitbreakersg #ovenroasted
