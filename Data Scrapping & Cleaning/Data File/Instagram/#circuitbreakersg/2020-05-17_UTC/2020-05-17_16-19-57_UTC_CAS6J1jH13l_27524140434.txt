*SIGHT WORDS ON ‚ôªÔ∏è EGG CARTON*

Not reinventing the wheel here but it‚Äôs still an engaging low-prep fun word sighting game for my little #29monthsold boy who is into learning the non-phonics decodable sight words.

A year back, I‚Äôve created a similar ‚ôªÔ∏è egg sorting colour play for him but he needed more guidance then. Now he pretty much knows instinctively how to sort and play with this setup.

I love how Jasper tries to recite the words aloud, unprompted, before matching the word sticks to the corresponding egg carton hole. This play works well to reinforce the 12 sight words he has learnt over the past few weeks. He was totally happy with himself for matching them all. Swipe ‚ñ∂Ô∏è see his learning in action. I‚Äôm proud of his patience in completing the game and for not giving up when he thinks he don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the word (for ‚Äúwas‚Äù) but still managed to recall it in the end. His love for learning is so precious! üíï

I left this on his play-shelf for the week for him to re-attempt, whenever he fancies. This simple low-prep play can be adapted/extended to matching Chinese words, upper-lower alphabet case matching, beginning letter sounds, number plays etc. The possibilities are pretty open-ended, depending on your child‚Äôs interest.
