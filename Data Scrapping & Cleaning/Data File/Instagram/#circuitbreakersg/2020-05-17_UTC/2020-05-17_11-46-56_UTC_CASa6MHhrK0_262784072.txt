💻 First Viewing Experience via Video Conference! 🤓⠀
⠀
My client and her hubby are first-timer buyers looking to relocate to Yishun. One of their objectives is to be closer to their parents for convenience. ⠀
⠀
I found a lovely 4-RM flat for them to view. Situated at the heart of the neighbourhood, just walking distance from their parents' house and minutes away from various amenities 👍🏼⠀
⠀
It was a new experience for me and my partner, Clement @clement_yeo_afiq, to view a unit via Zoom. It felt strange as we are used to being there physically and facilitating the process with an added personal touch 🤨⠀
⠀
But you see, that's the beauty of this real estate industry. We agents are required to be quick to adapt to new policies, new measures, new ways to the business. Alhamdulillah, I like a challenge and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn! 😊⠀
