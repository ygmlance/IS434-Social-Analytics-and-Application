My most satisfying & fullest CB meal yet (& yes, the most sinful) 🤪🍽️ After seeing @alainlicious ' Instagram stories on prata & prata sausage rolls, finally gave in to the temptation - 
Bought instant prata & thought of pairing it w curry from @toastboxsg 😆

1) Onion Prata Cheesy Sausage roll
2) Cheesy pepper scrambled eggs (looks better than the last scrambled eggs attempt 🤔)
3) Onion Prata w chicken potato curry
4) Iced yuan yang

So gonna die. Gonna exercise for real after this liao 😭😅 #PrataisLife #CurryPotatoisLove #ToastBoxSG #ThisWasBrunch #CBLife #CircuitBreakerSG
