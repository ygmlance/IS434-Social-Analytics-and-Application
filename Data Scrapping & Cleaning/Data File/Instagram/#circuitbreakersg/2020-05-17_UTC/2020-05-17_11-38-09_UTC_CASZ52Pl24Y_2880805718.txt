Another smashing home-cooked steak ü•©
‚Å£
Paired with a bottle of 2016 Ch√¢teau de Ricaud Bordeaux Sup√©rieur, this was extremely satisfying. The red wine was remarkably mild and mellow when chilled but developed alot more character once it warmed and aired. I believe this is my first French wine, but definitely won't be my last. ‚Å£
