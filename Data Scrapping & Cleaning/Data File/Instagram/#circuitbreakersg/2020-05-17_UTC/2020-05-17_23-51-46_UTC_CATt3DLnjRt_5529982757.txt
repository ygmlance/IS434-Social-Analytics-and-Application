Besides coffee, tea and juice treats we have received from our family’s friends we also got homebaked #madeleines from Minime2’s friend! Buttery and melts in your mouth goodness!
Madeleines are known for their beautiful and distinct scalloped shell shape. The original French madeleine is a small, traditional cake from two communes of the Lorraine region of northeastern France – Liverdun and Commercy. ... It is said that a girl named Madeline had been given these little cake-like cookies during her pilgrimage, and she brought the recipe back to France with her.
Although many think that madeleines are French shell shaped cookies, they are actually CAKE. Yes, #cake!!!! Lest anyone gets the mistaken idea they are anything else!
