Hubs wanted a burger while I felt like #fishandchips, so we decided to try @greenwoodfishmarket (Quayside) for the very first time! We enjoyed the fresh, unassuming style of the main courses (not overly greasy or heavy as these dishes often turn out), as well as the Lobster Bisque and Greek salad on the side. Ordered via their website on oddle.
