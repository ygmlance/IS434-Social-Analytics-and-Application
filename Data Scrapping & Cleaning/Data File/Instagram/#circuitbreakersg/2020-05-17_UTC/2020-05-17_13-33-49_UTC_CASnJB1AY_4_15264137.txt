Food again!!! Looking at frens' food postings for ideas on what to eat and what to cook.... so doing my part too!! 😅😅😂😂
Today's lunch is delicious pizza pasta from Pepperoni-pizza and dinner is home cooked 三菜一汤 - sesame oil oyster sauce chicken, steamed mullet, stir-fried kale and old cucumber soup 😋😋
