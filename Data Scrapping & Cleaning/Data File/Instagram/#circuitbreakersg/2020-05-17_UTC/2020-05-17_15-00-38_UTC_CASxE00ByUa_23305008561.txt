17/31 - Brain Juice
Prompt: Pick out a poetic form and give a try.
Reaction: Orange is a hard word to rhyme, but slim shady said tht you can try to bend words to rhyme. I tried to think about rhyme but it took up alot of time as i went on and on. But as i thought, it seemed that my brain is dry and empty. After a long train of thought, the idea just seem to struck me. I should just use a syring and pump some orange in.

For #circuitbreakermay, i've decided to take on an experiment in abstract imagery using the prompts from #theisolationjournals , to inspire me from their writing. During the #ecbm (extended circuit breaker measures) that will be in place in #singapore for the month of may.
