In this @beritamediacorp article on 16 May 2020, Ustaz Dr Mohamed Ali shared that although this year's #hariraya will be different, in the face of such challenges, the response of the #muslim community is important. 
His article calls upon the #muslim community to understand the need for the governmentâ€™s decision to discourage Hari Raya visiting and to defer the #Hajj pilgrimage in 2020.

Ustaz Dr Mohamed mentioned that as how #Islam has taught and emphasise in its teachings, #muslims should abide and adhere everything prescribed during this circuit breaker, including NOT making the #hariraya visit. Moreover, the measures that have been taken by the authorities to curb the spread of this outbreak are for the benefit of everyone.

Every #muslim needs to be convinced that all of these provisions have wisdom that may not be known to man.
