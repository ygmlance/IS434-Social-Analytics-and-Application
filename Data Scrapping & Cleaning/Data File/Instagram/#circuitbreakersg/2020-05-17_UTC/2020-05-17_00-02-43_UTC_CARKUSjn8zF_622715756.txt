This #nobake #cheesecake would probably not count as having 'baked' during this #circuitbreakersg.  For a few years now, I make a cake for the man's birthday. He tells me this is his favourite and this is probably the first 'cake' that I ever learnt to 'bake' ðŸ˜…. Making note of what I made for him this year and particularly this year thanks to covid-19 and social distancing measures we could not cut this with the family around us, so for the first time, 2 of us finished the whole cake.
