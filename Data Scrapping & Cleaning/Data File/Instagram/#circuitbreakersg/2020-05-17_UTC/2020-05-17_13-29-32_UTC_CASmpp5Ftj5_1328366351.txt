Cocks are everywhere. On the trees and roads. In Singapore , it is easy to spot roosters with their families, monkeys, wild pigs, otters and monitor lizards. Since we humans are not eating at hawker centres and coffee shops due to the circuit breaker , I've noticed the mynahs have taken to eating worms. Aww.. No more scraps of chicken rice, fried noodles, donuts or french fries ðŸ˜† for them. #singaporecb #sundayevening#nicewalk#coolweather#circuitbreakersg #singapore#singaporelife#sundaywalk
