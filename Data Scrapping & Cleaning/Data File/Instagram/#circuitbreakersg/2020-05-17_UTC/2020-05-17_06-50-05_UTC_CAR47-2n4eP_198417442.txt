💖Beef Char Siew💖
The beef is like so tender like pulled beef. 😍 Also not fatty like the traditional pork char siew. The sauce was light and sweet like char siew sauce yet not too sweet or sticky. Feels really healthy. 💓
Braised cabbage and shimeji mushroom is the savoury chinese crunchy style (not the soft Taiwanese braised type) but not too salty. 👍 Pearl barley brown rice was soft and chewy not dry and hard like the regular brown rice which is the reason why many don’t like brown rice. Overall, a really healthy light tasty meal from @graincomsg. 😊
