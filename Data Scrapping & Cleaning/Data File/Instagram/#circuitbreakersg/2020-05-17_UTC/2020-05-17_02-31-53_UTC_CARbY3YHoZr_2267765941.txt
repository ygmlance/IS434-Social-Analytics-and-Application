Have brunch at home with Don Quijoteâ€™s Huevos Estrelledos or Huevos Rotos.

Of Madrid-origin, both names are used to describe this â€˜Broken Eggsâ€™. It can come in ANY form so long as there is a component of eggs, potatoes and some form of meat! But at DQ, we serve ours with cubed potatoes, chorizo and with eggs just runny enoughðŸ¤¤

So DM us or get in touch with our CONTACT button for a taste.
