Took the day off the kitchen today to complete my project! I started this when I used to live in GZ...it's been 1.5 years since coming back, and I finally have time to complete it! Thankful for May hols👏👏 能吃的我做....不能吃的我也做！😂😂😂 #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #sgparent #DIY #feltcraft #sginstagram #sewing #circuitbreakersg  #stayhomesg #stayhomeday41
