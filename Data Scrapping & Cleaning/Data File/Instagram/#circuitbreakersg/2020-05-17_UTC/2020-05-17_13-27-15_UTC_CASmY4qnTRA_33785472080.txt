Chateau La Conseillante 2002

When you thirst for alcohol you will open any wine you see. Saw this sitting in the cellar and decided to open it yesterday night to drink today (I confess I opened 4 bottles over the weekend and there was only 2 of us drinking ðŸ˜…). From a much derided Bordeaux vintage - I actually thought this was pretty decent. Perhaps a little simple and short. Otherwise enjoyable and up to my (initially Low) expectations. I suspect this can go on for another 10 years. .
