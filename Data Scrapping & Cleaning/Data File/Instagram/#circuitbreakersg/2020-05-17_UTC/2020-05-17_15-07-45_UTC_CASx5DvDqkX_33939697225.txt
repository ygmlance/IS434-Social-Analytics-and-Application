I'm in a lazy mode today and I just received my replenishment of truffle oil from #trufflehunter. So lunch is an easy truffle carbonara with poached egg and rice instead of pasta. I'm glad the Simlets share my love of truffle. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #truffleoil #carbonara #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
