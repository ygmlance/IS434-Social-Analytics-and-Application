We are truly blessed to be able to bring a piece of Iggyâ€™s into your home during this Circuit Breaker.
.
My friends in Kuala Lumpur are not eating as well as us here in Singapore, and they are very envious that our infrastructure for takeaway food is so developed.
.
We continue our charity takeout with @healthservesg till 31 May every Fri, Sat and Sun. Help us to raise funds so that @healthservesg can continue their good work with our migrant workers.  Details in the link in our bio.

Do good, eat well and stay safe!
