When life puts you under #lockdown, think 'out of the box', because: a). it will sharpen your faculties, b). you don't exactly have a choice 😬.

On one such stressful day of house arrest, after being told by my first born that all my ideas were super boring, I found this box staring at me (it was kept aside for binning, as it wasn't sparking joy in me anymore). And bam! Realisation dawned that its days weren't exactly over, and that it had a glorious lockdown purpose to serve.
.
So out came the little artists to unleash their boxed-up creativity. The recycling, the repurposing, the resurgence of enthusiasm - I was living the lockdown dream ❤👌. And the best part? It was a colourful, prolonged and engaging activity for Shivin and Ruhan, which did not end at painting. It was followed by the two impatiently waiting for the box to dry up, and then arguing (fighting?) over which toys were most befitting to make it inside their little creation 😅.
.
The bar has been set high guys. Please wish me box full of ideas (too many box puns, sorry!) 🙏, as my next lot of craft material isn't reaching us anytime soon 😅.
