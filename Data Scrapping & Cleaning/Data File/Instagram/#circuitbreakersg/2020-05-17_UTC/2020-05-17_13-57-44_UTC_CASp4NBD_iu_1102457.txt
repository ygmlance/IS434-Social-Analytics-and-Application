#CircuitBreakersg Day 41! Whatâ€™s on my dinner menu? Tried a new dish! Hong Zao Ji - red glutinous rice wine chicken, using wine lees from @wricewine and a long bean omelette. I added some stock into the chicken so I donâ€™t have to cook soup. Simple 2 dishes meal. Glad my family like the Hong Zao Ji and said it taste like ma you ji. So is it suppose to taste like that? ðŸ˜‚ I am not sure too ðŸ˜…
