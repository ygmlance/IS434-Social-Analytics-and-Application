A dried version of the famous Pork Adobo - who won’t love that glaze on the succulent pork belly braised in light soy sauce, fish sauce, and white wine vinegar reduction with garlic and bay leaf. It is actually good with herbed quinoa (so less guilty than with rice)! 😏 #adobo #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
