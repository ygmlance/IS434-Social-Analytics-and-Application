A leopard never changes its spots. But out in the safari, it’s not just the leopard that has their own beautiful patterns that define them. So does the zebra with its strips and crocodiles with its scaly skins! Today we learn about the wonderful patterns of safari animals by paint stamping! Baby A had a wonderful messy fun! .

These Animal Print Stamps are multi-functional, can be used for dough stamping and paint stamping learning activities to create wonderful texture effects . Tips: use @crayola washable paint for paint stamping for easy clean up!
