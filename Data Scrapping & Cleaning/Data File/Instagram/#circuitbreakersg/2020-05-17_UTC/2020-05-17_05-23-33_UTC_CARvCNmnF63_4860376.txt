This is the dish I almost always eat the morning right after I land in #Singapore: the bak chor mee (noodles with minced pork in this out-of-this-world aromatic broth) at 58 Minced Meat Mee. It’s been almost 2 months since I’ve been home and it hasn’t crossed my lips yet — I thought today might be the day but look at this queue! Sigh. Another day, then ... #sadness #tragedy #hawkerfood #bakchormee #bcm #sgfood #sglife #cblife #bedok #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #noodles #cibocinese #singaporeanfood
