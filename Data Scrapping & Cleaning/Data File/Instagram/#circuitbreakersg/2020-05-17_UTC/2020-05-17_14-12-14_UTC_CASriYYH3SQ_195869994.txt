[20.20 May 17: Circuit Breaker Day 41] It has been a while since my last attempt. Homemade char siew since it is unlikely that we can travel to Hong Kong to enjoy its roast at least for the next 1-2 years. Thanks @ilovedefamily for the recipe! Gravy was good for braising Kong bak, caramelized it to thicken if you want to make char siew.
🐽 
Original recipe (below) was good but a little saltish as feedback by @xavier_chua.sg, so I decided to tweak it a little the next attempt. Overall, this recipe is keeper!
🐽 
Pork belly 600g, poke the sides with a fork and marinate it with the following:
4 tbspoon light soy sauce
2 tbspoon chinese cooking wine
1 tbspoon dark soy sauce
1 tbspoon oyster sauce
5 cloves of garlic smashed
1 cinnamon bark
1 star anise

500g water
100g Gula Melaka
🐽 
Using #NinjaFoodiOP300,
👉🏻 Sauté mode to bring water to boil and add in Gula Melaka to melt before putting in the pork belly and marinade in.
👉🏻 Pressure mode 20 mins
👉🏻 After pressure is released, switch to sauté mode again, continue to cook until gravy thickens.
*tip* to speed things up, u can scoop out and reduce the amount  of gravy in the pot. It thickens much faster. Just make sure it's enough to coat all the pork belly.
👉🏻 Remove, slice the char siew and serve! #开饭咯
