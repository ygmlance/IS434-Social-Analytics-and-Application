DayN of #circuitbreakersg : Lunch Plate filled with nutrition rich veggies and protein. Love love love the colorful lunch Plate, though itâ€™s an effort. From the bottom of my heart I feel cooking a therapeutic it calms mind and feel relaxed while spending around 1-1.30hrs in the kitchen cooking for the loved ones. I grew up eating like this as my mom use to prepare full variety of power packed meals. Thus i relish a full meal plate. Took a small nap after the tasty lunch, then in the evening plucked all the leaves from the greens so that it will be ready for the busy week. ğŸŒ·
