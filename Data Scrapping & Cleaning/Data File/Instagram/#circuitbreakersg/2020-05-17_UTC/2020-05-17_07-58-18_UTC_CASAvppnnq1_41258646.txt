Basketball Ramen! Marutama! No zenbu nose! Late lunch takeway of char siu ramen! Pai seh for the smashed char siu as I was too hungry! My dad’s bowl looks more presentable. Squeezed some lemon juice to the soup, won’t be so “jerlat”. Oops forgot to take the fried gyozas. 🤣 #circuitbreakersg #lunch #dinner
