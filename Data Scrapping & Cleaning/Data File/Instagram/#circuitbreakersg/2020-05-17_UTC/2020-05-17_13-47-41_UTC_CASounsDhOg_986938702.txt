#myrunningdiary It’s rest day and watched short horror films on YouTube the entire afternoon.  I love horror genre type of entertainment 👻  Can’t complete my day with some cardio which is to get my heart pumping..... I believe our average heart rate is about 76 bpm at rest? (Am sure it was in my secondary school science) if I can double it during my run, I’m happy enough since I’m no spring chicken 😂 Today’s running strategy was to sprint and walk, sprint and walk....as opposed to my very slow continuous pace 2 runs ago. My last run about 5 days ago was not a run but just brisk walking which I didn’t record cos I didn’t know Apple Watch had a brisk walk mode! How cool.  Maybe one day I can run the entire way.... 😁😁 that will be way great!! #6thrun #stayingactive #runningjourney #jogging #joggingjogging #joggingjourney #cardio #cardio🏃 #keepingfit #stayinghealthy #cardioworkout #outdoorsport #outdoorsports #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
