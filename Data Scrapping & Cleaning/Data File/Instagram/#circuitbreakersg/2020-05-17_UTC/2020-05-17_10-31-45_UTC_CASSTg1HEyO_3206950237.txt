We have been cooking more often than before to stay safe since the start of the Circuit Breaker in April. The wife has been the one (like duh) who comes up with the menu for us and the little one. After trying out so many new dishes, she plans to cook crabs tonight for the first time and theyâ€™re really delicious! The little one and I are very blessedğŸ’›
