Beer Bottle Cap Bending üëáüèº
‚Å£
Just like card tearing, the principle of specificity applies to beer bottle cap bending. The best way to train for it is to do it in a controlled manner.
‚Å£
Here, I have a beer bottle cap from Two Metre Tall Brewery, which is especially suited for training purposes because the paper label dulls its sharp edges; and being slightly larger than most standard beer bottle caps, it is tougher and able to withstand more repeated bending. ‚Å£
‚Å£
But you can use any beer bottle cap that you have; just know that not all caps are made equal, and some are way tougher than others. You could put some masking tape on your training cap at the start to protect your fingers without losing much of the sensory input. ‚Å£

You can learn where and how to position the beer bottle cap from the video - close to the base of your fingers, with the open side facing towards your fingertips. Some other tips that help in full-body strength generation:
‚Å£
1. Squeeze with your entire fist; you can even make a tight fist with your free hand.
‚Å£
2. "Pack" the breath, i.e. breathe in deeply and hold your breath, just before squeezing.
‚Å£
3. Perform the "anal lock", i.e. tense your sphincter muscle as if you are trying to hold back an unwelcome shit.
‚Å£
4. Curl your toes in strongly, as though you are gripping imaginary towels with them.
‚Å£
5. Basically just tense your whole body and focus your energy into crushing the cap.
‚Å£
As with most physical pursuits, there will be pain. That pain is the stimulus for your body to adapt to the demands that you're making of it. So embrace it, and allow it to make you stronger.
‚Å£
To make the most out of a bottle cap, squeeze it, open it up, and squeeze it again. Try to do this between different fingers - the dream is to be able to bend multiple caps simultaneously with one hand. Be careful though - after repeated bending the metal will start tearing, at which point you can just proceed to rip the bottle cap in half as I did here. ‚Å£

If you're getting bored at home during this #circuitbreaker and have beer bottle caps at your disposal, give this one a go! Better grip means better strength output through your hands, which is always handy.
