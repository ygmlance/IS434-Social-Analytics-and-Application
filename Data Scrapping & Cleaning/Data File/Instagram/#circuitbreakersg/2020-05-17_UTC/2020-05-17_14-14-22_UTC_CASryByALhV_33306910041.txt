#ThankYouTeachers (especially our P1 son's Chinese teacher of #MOESingapore for introducing #TangPoems as an activity during this extraordinary school holiday). Today (17-May-2020), our son wrote (copied from the book "Tang Poetry in Pictures" published by 玲子传媒 #lingzimedia) his favorite #TangPoetry: #悯农 (a #五言绝句) by Li Shen (a Mandarin court official), while I was cooking our lunch. May we appreciate how toilful each granule of rice on our bowl/plate is! Yes, our son still has a lot to learn about understanding (and hopefully remembering) #唐诗 and writing #ChineseCharacters properly, may all of us jiayou together! #ThankYouFarmers #ThankYouDeliveryWorkers #ThankYouSupermarketStaff #ThankYouInventors (of electricity and fridge) #ThankYouEngineers and those who have contributed to every element of our food so that we could still have meals daily. #ThankYouFather (my late father) also for buying pictorial books of #唐诗三百首 more than two decades ago. #SGUnited #SingaporeTogether #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #stayhomestaysafe#StayHomeStaySafeStayCurious https://youtu.be/kD4Bed8F9LI
