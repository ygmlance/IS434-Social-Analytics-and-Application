Craving for something sweet? Make your own strawberry jam! 
All you need is 500g (10-14pcs) of strawberries 🍓and a cup of honey 🍯. Remove the strawberry stems and break the berries into pieces, by using a spoon to “scoop” the strawberries up. It’s much easier! 
Mix the 🍓 and 🍯, and let it sit for 20-30mins. 
Pour the mixture into a pot and continuously stir it over low heat for about 45mins-1hour, until you get a nice consistency. To check if your jam is ready, spread some jam onto an ice-cold plate and run your finger through it. If you tilt the plate and the jam isn’t runny, it is ready to be served.

And you’re done! It’s that simple 😋
