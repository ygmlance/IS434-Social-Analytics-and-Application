#circuitbreakerday41 // #sichuandumplings x #zhajiangmian for waking up disorientated, thinking i was in Beijing (where I’ve been only once, and it was awkward the waitstaff kept looking at Asian-y me to order meals, when it was obvious only the blonde-ish peeps could read the hieroglyphic menus).
.
Must have been worrying about friends in China and listening to John’s sermon on #以赛亚书40 @sthelensbishopsgate (miraculously understood 50% of it) last night, that did it.

Q: Why should we trust God? Of course we should - he’s God innit. But we hardly act as if we believe this.

“谁曾用掌心量过海水，
用手掌测过苍天呢？
谁曾用升斗量过大地的尘土，
用秤称山岭，
用天平称冈陵呢？
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance?“ - Isaiah 40:12
🍜 We must trust Him because He is great, and we are limited.
.
Still, we sometimes say we know better than God: if left to us we would not have put ourselves in this difficult situation, we would not have given ourselves this terrible boss, etc.
“谁曾测度耶和华的灵，
或作过他的谋士教导他呢？
他与谁商议，谁使他有聪明？
谁把正确的路指教他，把知识指教他，
又把明智的路教导他呢？
Who has measured the Spirit of the LORD, or what man shows him his counsel? 
Whom did he consult, and who made him understand? Who taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding?” - Isaiah 40:13-14
🍜 We must trust Him because only God is truly wise and just. .
.
When we look around, we think that nations and governments are more powerful than God.
“看哪！万国都像水桶里的一滴，
又被看作天平上的微尘。
看哪！他举起众海岛，好象微细之物。 Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as the dust on the scales...” - Isaiah 40:15
🍜 Yet they are nothing to God.
.
Do we trust in people, even powerful people, more than God?
“神坐在大地的圆穹之上，
地上的居民好象蚱蜢，
他铺张诸天如铺张幔子，
展开众天像展开可以居住的帐棚。
他使诸侯都归于无有，
使地上的审判官成为虚空。 
It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers...
who brings princes to nothing, and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.” - Isaiah 40:22-23
🍜 They too are nothing to God.
.
So let’s persevere in trusting YHWH alone, in the strength He gives us.
