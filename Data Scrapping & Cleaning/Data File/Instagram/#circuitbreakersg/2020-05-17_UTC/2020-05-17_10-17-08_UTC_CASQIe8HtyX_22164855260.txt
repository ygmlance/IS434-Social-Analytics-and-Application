Realizing how many boxes of our kimchi fries we've delivered to you since #CircuitbreakerSG and wanted to say how grateful we are for all of you Vatos Cantina lovers. You kept us going through a rough time by sharing, ordering, posting and eating our Ko-Mex creations.  We can't wait to get more kimchi fries and our newly named 𝐉𝐮𝐚𝐧 𝐓𝐨𝐨 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐆𝐎𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐚 to your living room.  Happy Sunday #CantinaCulture .
