Home made pastry on a Sunday is a bliss. ðŸ˜Š
Cheatsheet:
Frozen Roti Prata (available in supermarkets)
- 1 prata skin makes 2 puff. Cut into half, and foldover the fillings, press the sides using a fork to seal it up.
Taro - chop into small cubes, steam till fully soften.
Add sugar, a little salt... mashed to paste-like texture and mix well with oil of your preference. (I am using extra virgin coconut oil) You can also add some full cream milk to make it creamier.
Pork floss - bought from @beechenghiangsg 
Air fryer @philipssg - 180Â°C , 15 minutes
