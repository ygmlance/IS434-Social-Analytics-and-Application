Pork crackling is back.
.
Today, with a medley of Tri-colored vegetable and kraut Spaghettini.
.
(I think purple sauerkraut is gonna be my new favorite to make, just because itâ€™s such a pretty color to plate.)
.
Nonya rice dumplings.
Another of the bubbas favorite foods.
(Also something Iâ€™ve watched my maternal grandmother make whenever she comes over occasionally when I was little.)
.
Been about 4 years since Iâ€™ve last made these.
Guess itâ€™s a good time to refresh my skills before next month.ðŸ¤“
