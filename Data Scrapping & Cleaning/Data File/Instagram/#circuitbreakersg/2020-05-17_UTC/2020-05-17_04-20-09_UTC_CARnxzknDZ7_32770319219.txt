"Looking Back | Looking Forward... "
.
SEASON 6 of our Singapore virtual arts festival is here >>> https://www.apart.sg/featured-season-6
(Link in bio @apart.sg)
.
This season, as we enter the last week of Ramadhan and the second last week (hopefully) of the circuit breaker, we look to the past for insight as we approach the future: from revivals of archived productions that are still strangely pertinent, to the perspectives of senior citizens on climate change and the future, to re-negotiating familiar connections.
.
The important social issues that have been raised over the past few weeks are not new, but have come back to bite us now in this vulnerable moment. Social inequality, misinformation, disconnection; these were important mistakes to us then that are even more pressing now. So letâ€™s dig deeper and look back to help us move forward.
.
Follow us on our social media channels to be notified of exciting updates as soon as they happen. Be a part, and stay tuned each week!
