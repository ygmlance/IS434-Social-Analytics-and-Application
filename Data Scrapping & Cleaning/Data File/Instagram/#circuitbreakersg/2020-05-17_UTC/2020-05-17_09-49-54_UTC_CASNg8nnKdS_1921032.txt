My little boy is starting school when school reopens in June with korkor! Zeynen will be #19monthsold by then. Mixed feeling. Finally smelling freedom for having my own time, to be able to focus on my work during office hours and pamper myself to salon for a nice hairdo anytime. Need not specifically/低声下气-ly to ask someone to look after him.

Having said that I’m working from home, doesn’t mean that working half an hour here and there can allow me to be be productive. You see, there’s a reason for full 8 working hours. Even I have meetings, I have to touch & go and rush back home to take over Zeynen, buying lunch outside and have to eat while driving to save time. Because to and fro, plus meeting, at least 2 hours out, and 2 hours out is consider Long for my caretaker. I ever push a meeting 4 times before because of unforeseen weather *看脸色*! It has been so tough for me as a almost 2 years of working from home mom. No one in the family can understand it. When I say I can’t wait to send him to school, everyone in the family thinks that Zeynen is so poor thing. No one can understand yet at the same time, how much I didn’t want to send him to school as well. Especially during this covid madness situation.

The thoughts of sending him to school is emotional for me o’ready. Who else can feel me?

Dear #covid, can you be gone and at least make me feel a tad better for sending my son to school at this not-so-safe period?
