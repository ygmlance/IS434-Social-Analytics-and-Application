*Bringing your own...*

... lunchboxes, snack baggies, reusable coffee cups isn‚Äôt just singularly about using something pretty or cool, reducing single-use waste, giving waste disposal staff a respite, giving relief to food sellers, more effort on the consumer or using resources at home to get our containers clean. *It is all of the above* and probably more.

The whole world has been and still is affected by #covid19 and I personally feel the impact of disruptions in supply chain. What about you? Have you noticed price increases in food or daily necessities?

A recent @straits_times article reported on the shortage of takeaway food containers and how one stall owner paid 35% more buying retail than he would wholesale because that‚Äôs all he could find. This despite already paying more for ingredients and not passing the cost onto the final consumer. @keongsaikbakery‚Äôs also facing packaging shortages and is encouraging customers to byo with a little incentive (thank you üíõ).

If one single-use container costs 20 cents, a 35% increase is only an extra 7 cents. But all these little costs add up, don‚Äôt they? The total for 100 containers? 1000? The number of takeaway increases during the Circuit Breaker lockdown? It also adds to the volume of waste at Semakau, whose current lifespan projection is 2035 (when it will fill to capacity), down from the initial projection of 2045.

So please #BYO! If you want to get something for your BYO journey, feel free. But remember the arsenal of things you already have that will allow you to do this. As long as you wash the garlic smells out of that jar that used to contain chilli, who‚Äôs to say it can‚Äôt be used for a coffee or tea? üòâüí™ü§ù
