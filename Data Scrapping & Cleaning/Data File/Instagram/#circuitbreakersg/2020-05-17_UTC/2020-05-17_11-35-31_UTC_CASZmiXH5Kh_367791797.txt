Wrapping up my Sunday ❤️ Just wanted to post my after workout exercise pictures 😉 I haven’t been sharing much of “myself” after exercising during the CB 😉 So grateful that I am keeping myself remain very active. 😄 So thankful to be able to do fitness at home which is always my norm - so simple just with Yoga exercise mat and a pair of 1kg dumbbells is my fave 😘😁😄 I like this to be a reminder to think of our fitness, health and happiness goals that we can start something to help it. It is also a reminder to look after myself especially self-care 👌💪 Take care and stay safe everybuddy ❤️ #circuitbreakersg #gratefulthankfulblessed #fitnessathome #nogymnoproblem #healthylifestyle #healthyandfit #evaxfitness602
