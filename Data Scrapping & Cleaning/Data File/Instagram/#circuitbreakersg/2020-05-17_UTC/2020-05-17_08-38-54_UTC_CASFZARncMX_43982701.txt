Something savoury for tea. Steamed yam cake (orh kueh), homemade version are packed with lup cheong, mushrooms and dried prawns in very bite. Drizzled with dark sweet sauce, so addictive, would be even better with some chilli sauce, unfortunately there was none at home. #orhkueh #yamcake #sgeats #sgfood #singaporehomecooks #sghomecooking #stfoodtrending #burpple #8dayseat #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeforsg #chinesefood #eattheworld #foodgram #foodphotography #beautifulcuisines #feedfeed #f52grams #seriouseats #thekitchn #foodstagram #foodlover #huffposttaste #buzzfeedfood #sgfooddiary #heresmyfood #foodspotting #foodforfoodies #foodiegram #foodbeast
