Homemade Ikea meatballs using the recipe they released. I paired it with corn and cauliflower-potato mash.

I have this little ice cream scoop that allows me to make the balls about the same size. This is great for even cooking and speeds up the process.

The husband prefers this to what we buy off the shelves because he says itâ€™s less doughy. Have you tried making the ikea meatballs?
