#circuitbreakersg Day 41 - Had these wings & drums marinated this morning to make Chicken Potato Stew for dinner. Added carrot chunks, mushrooms and black fungus to complete the dish. -
This is one dish I'll never get tired of, and will always need more gravy to drench over my rice. 😋🍗🍚🥣
Perfect comfort food when it started raining during dinner. -
