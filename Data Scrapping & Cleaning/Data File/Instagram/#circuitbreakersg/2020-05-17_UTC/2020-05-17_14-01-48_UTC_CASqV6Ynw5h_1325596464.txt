Angle and Authenticity.
.
Taking stills is tough. Anyone can shoot something inanimate...but telling the story is quite another.
.
I shoot when the item is being  used so that the background ( or foreground) creates the context and story. I also try to find an interesting angle (not every still has to be on a table top or at eye-level.)

Photo: An item that has become essential during #circuitbreaker season in almost every home is the earphones / headphones. But more than just for #WFH or #hbl ( Home-based Learning) earphones create the much needed space for each of us when we #stayhome by shutting away everything for just that one essential thing, be it work, exercise, recreation or simply to rest.
