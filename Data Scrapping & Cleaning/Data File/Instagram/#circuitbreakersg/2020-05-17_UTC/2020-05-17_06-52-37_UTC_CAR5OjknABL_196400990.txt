Sunday Afternoon Tea, was Ondeh Ondeh from @kuehs_and_snacks . It is a (usually green coloured) ball-shaped kueh with a glutinous rice and sweet potato flour skin, filled with liquid palm sugar, and coated with fresh grated coconut. Pop the whole ball in your mouth and bite, and it will squirt out its centre of liquid palm sugar! Always fun and delicious to eat! ðŸ˜‹ #ondehondeh #nyonyakueh #kuehsandsnacks #sgfood #sgfoodculture #sghawkerfood #sghawkerculture #ourhawkerculture #slowfoodheritagehero #supportlocalsg #savefnbsg #tapao #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg #sundayafternoontea
