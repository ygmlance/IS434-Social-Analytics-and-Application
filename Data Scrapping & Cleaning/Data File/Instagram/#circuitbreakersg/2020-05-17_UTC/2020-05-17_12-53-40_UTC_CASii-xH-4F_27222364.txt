Fun exploring different ways to eat & enjoy smoked duck given by sis. 👩🏻‍🍳😋🍖✌️❤️🌈Haha, tried cold smoked duck salad, baked a piece of smoked duck in casserole for 1st try to eat on off days. Finally, pan-seared smoked duck slices in happy call pan for Momo big breakfast smoked duck burger stuffed with tomato slices & mushroom cheese omelette with last stash of burger bun from sis. 🍔🍖🍅🧀🥐🍽☕️ Home brewed filter coffee & pranai chai pairs well with smoked duck cuisine too. Yums! Cooking & baking is a good way to destress, unwind & chill for off days during #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #momobakingcookingdiary #eattasteenjoy #funcookingbakingcuisine #bakingcookingtherapy #foodtherapy #youmakemesmile #cookout #smokedduckburger #nomsnoms #savoursmokedduck #pranaichai #amuseprojects #restrefreshrechargerenew #2020fighting #stayhome #staysafe #staysane #onestepatatimetostillnesswithin  #keepcalmandcarryon #takedeepbreaths #eatexerciseexhale 🙏🌈
