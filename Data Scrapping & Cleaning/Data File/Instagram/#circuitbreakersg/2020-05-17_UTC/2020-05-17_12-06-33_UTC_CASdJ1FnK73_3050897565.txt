You know chwee kueh and the chye poh (preserved radish) that comes with it? Well, we got it from good stalls and the leftover radish we fried with kway teow into a dry hor fun dish that is served at many teochew restaurants! Was good! Only thing missing was the lard.  Separately, j found this interesting instant tang hoon from Japan for the first time. Five different soups, I have it when I'm eating dry noodles.
