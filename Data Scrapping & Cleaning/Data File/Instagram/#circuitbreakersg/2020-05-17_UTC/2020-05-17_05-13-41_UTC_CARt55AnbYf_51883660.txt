Can I ask my boss whether I could go back to office after 1 Jun? 
Then I have an excuse I need to go work and MIA from home ... #IalsoNeedAPayRaiseToHireAHelper
It’s tiring for many us to juggle cleaning, cooking on top of existing commitments ... Thanks a friend for sharing a tuna salad post... It’s a super easy and simple idea for weekdays lunch! . . .
Here is my Sunday lunch after cleaning the home this morning ... I still have a toilet to clean ... 😩
. . .
Tuna Salad (Serving: 1-2)
- 2 avocados 🥑 - 1 can chunked tuna (I’m using the one in water and salted) - half chopped onion
- any other fruits or veggies at home (my apples are rotting so put in for the non-keto at home, my tomatoes are aging too)
. . .
Dressing:
- 2-3 drops Lemon 🍋 eo (covid time is hard for me to get lemon, else you may use 2 tbl lemon juice)
- Black pepper
- 2 tbl evoo -0.5 tsp acv (Skip it you are using lemon juice)
- 0.5 tsp salt (Skip if your tuna is salted like mine) 
Pour the dressing, mix and serve. . .
