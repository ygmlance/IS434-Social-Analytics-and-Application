🕢Dinner: -Budae Jjigae🇰🇷
Budae Jjigae,aka Korean Army stew is a true Korean comforting soul food that was created after the Korean War when food was scarce and ppl put together this dish using the scrounged or smuggled surplus foods from the U. S. army base combined together Korean ingredients.

I always prefer using fresh ingredients which my army stew is topped with baked beans, beef shabu, pork belly shabu, abalone mushroom, homegrown bean sprout, tofu, kimchi, rice cake, fish cake, ramyeon and korean red pepper paste on a bed of cabbages.

And this savoury one-pot meal pairs perfectly well with Soju.

Mashisoyo😋
