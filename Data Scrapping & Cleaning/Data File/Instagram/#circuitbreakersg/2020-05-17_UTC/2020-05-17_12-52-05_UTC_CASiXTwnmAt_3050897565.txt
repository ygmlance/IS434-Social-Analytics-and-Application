@nongshim Shin Ramyun Black.
I specially ordered this and its not available in the mainstream supermarkets. Unfortunately I don't understand Korean, but this 'black' version is supposed to have beef or pork extract in it. I'm not sure though as there are different versions for various countries. It's a very nice soup with three seasonings inside. but I'm not sure it tastes different enough for me to have to order it online in future.
Can someone tell me what the three packets are? That may help my decision. Is there pork or beef?
