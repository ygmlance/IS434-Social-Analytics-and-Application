Sunday Brunch, was a lazy affair, where i put together a dish of Chicken Chop Noodles, made with Mee Pok tossed in leftover braising sauce from Wednesdayâ€™s dinner, a reheated chicken chop that was set-aside from Thursdayâ€™s dinner, together with a few sprigs of blanched Kai Lan, or Chinese Kale. Simple and tasty! ðŸ˜‹ #chickenchopnoodles #reheatedleftovers #nowastemeal #eatathome #sundaybrunch #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
