Lai Lai Lai let me bring you to Taiwan 🇹🇼 this afternoon. 
I wanted so much to eat their popular mee sua so I decided to make it instead. 
Taiwanese Oyster Mee Sua (orh ah mee sua). Not a difficult recipe. 
The mee sua that I used is red dried mee sua. The umami flavoured stock is made with bonito flakes, fried shallots, dried cuttle fish and chicken stock, which makes it so tasty.
The smooth texture, coupled with juicy oysters is so simple yet irresistible. Best way to enjoy this dish is to send it slurping into your mouth! For those who love vinegar, this goes really well with black vinegar n pepper. I prefer red vinegar so I used it instead. I added braised pig intestines to up its level 🤭. Garnish it with fresh coriander leaf and it’s ready to serve.
