Have you watched last evening's live programme with renowned local host @you_yi ? I hope you have enjoyed the session. 😍👍🏻
.
I shared how covid19 has affected the travel blogging work, so how I turn towards another scope of work in training, and educating minds on adapting to changes. Also shared several travel tales. ♥️👍🏻
.
When the host toss the question to me on tips for adapt to change, I decided to talking about 3 main points. 🥰👍🏻
.
1) Positive mindset, as cliche as it may sounds, but this is the rule to survivor. A negative mindset wont get you anywhere and you wont be happy. Having a positive mindset is crucial and it really depends in yourself. Learn to appreciate things in life. So this brings to the next point.
.
2) Focus in yourself than others. We always like to pin point at others, compare with others, complain at others... so stop whining, complaining, finger pointing and focus more in yourself. Look at how u can improve when things are wrong, and take your strength to the next height! .
3) Reflect, Repent, Restructure & Recharged! .
Reflect upon our past and see how we can be better! Repent on the things we have done wrong and make up for it. Restructure by self assessing yourself and close any learning gaps by going for skills upgrading. The circuit breaker is a good chance to build up our skills, knowledge and adjust our attitude.
.
Lastly, Recharged... how many times we always wished that we have more time for our family or take a rest? Covid19 provide us this opportunity to stay at home, so make full use of the chance to rest and recharged ourselves and family. When covid19 lockdown is over, we can charge again and take things to new heights. ♥️👍🏻
.
Your altitude depends on your attitude! 😍👍🏻
