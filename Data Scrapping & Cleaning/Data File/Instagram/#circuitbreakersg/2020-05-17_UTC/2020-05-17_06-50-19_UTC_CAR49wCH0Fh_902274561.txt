How many of you have been snacking more often ever since the start of Circuit Breaker? 
I know I have so I tried to resist those unhealthy (yet so comforting) titbits as much as I can and grab a fruit instead. 
Ian has his own favourite fruits so I will make a weekly or bi-weekly purchase of Deluxe Green Grapes, Envy apples and if available, Rock Melon, Papaya or Watermelon. 
He's not a fan of oranges, and I suspected that he could have remembered taking (or being force fed ðŸ˜…) brufen (usually orange-flavoured) whenever he had high fevers above 39Â°C. Oops~ ðŸ˜“ðŸ¤­ Anyway, my usual seller from @ms.redhill was selling these seasonal Autumn Gold Sweet Oranges and Thai rambutans. So I just went for it and add on to my usual list of veg/ fruits for the delivery. 
Are you looking for a reliable fresh fruit/ vegetable seller? You can search for Ms Redhill or Happy Farm on Facegroup or @happyfarmsg on Shopee for organic produce and fruits. 
Im just a happy customer who got to know them since they had a popup stall at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital previously on every Wed/ Thur. 
They own a wet market stall at Redhill market so if you are nearby, you can drop by to get your vegetables and fruits. Else just check out their FB/ Shopee. ðŸ˜‰
