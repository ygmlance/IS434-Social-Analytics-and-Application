And so we end another week of #circuitbreakersg, Day 41. For once, I think you’ll all be in agreement with me - that we can’t wait for It to end. Oh beer, you make me very happy at the end of every shitty day, along with having good health, our families being safe, , good friends, wonderful loyal regulars, and fabulous new people that we have met throughout this lockdown. Here’s to a better tomorrow. “The sun will shine again. No matter how painful and hard the rain may beat down on me.” - Natsuki Takaya
