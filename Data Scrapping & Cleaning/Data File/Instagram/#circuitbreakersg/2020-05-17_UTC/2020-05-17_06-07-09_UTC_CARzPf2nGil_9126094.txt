#YinYoga with #WinterTheCat 😸 What have you guys been up to at home?

I’ve been doing classes - Acting, Accent, Dance, Yoga, Stretch - so many online options nowadays. But I’ve also been organizing ice cream delivery for @holycowcreamery as well as volunteering by helping out with Project Kind Heart #FreeMaskSG and @willingheartssg ❤️ Hope everyone is staying safe & taking care of yourselves! Let me know how you are doing 💕
