Really tough looking for recipes which didn't require too many ingredients especially since I just wanted to try for fun! It needed to be gluten-free, dairy free and egg free. Many of them required alot of 'usually not in my pantry' type of ingredients like xanthum gum or psyllium husk, sometimes even sorghum flour. .
.
So when I eventually found a basic recipe, I went for it. Only thing, need to find gluten-free flour. But with the scarcity of regular flour, this meant I had to go to specialty stores. Thankfully, I got some. .

Here you go, it turned out ok, I think. The crust is nice but the texture needs to be improved. Then again, gluten-free flour does differ from brand to brand, blend to blend and the whole works. For now, this will do. #glutenfree #eggfree #diaryfree #culinaryadventuresofpebsicle #junkpebzlmtk #circuitbreakersg
