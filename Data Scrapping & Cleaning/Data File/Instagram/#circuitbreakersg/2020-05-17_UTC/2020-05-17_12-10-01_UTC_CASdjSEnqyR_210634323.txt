#day40 #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg last day of wfh

Went out for a monkey hunt but not even 1 monkey spotted 😑 lol.. in the end rewarded ourselves with great hawker food lunch

Went out to play ball and bubble after nap. Got to know a new friend in the estate too ☺️ a great outdoor to sweat it out 
Giving this girl more responsibility at home now. Letting her to take her own plated and utensils to get ready for meal and keeping them in the sink when she’s done. Saw improvements these few days.. I hope it’s not just a 3 min thing
