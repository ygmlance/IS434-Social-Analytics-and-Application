Thank you all for your support for both our preorders and ready made #fabricmasks since February. Our readymade masks have been flying off the shelves since we started selling them a month ago. More new designs in both kids and adults sizes will be made available in our #etsyshop over the next few days. Don’t forget to check out the discounted bundles too! Stay tuned for the next update on their availability. .
