Afternoon tea with donuts from @haritts_singapore and kuki hojicha from @antea.social! ☕️
✨
Preordered the original (S$2.50) and nutella (S$3.20) donuts a few days ago as I’ve been wanting to try their donuts for a while. Honestly, I was quite disappointed with their donuts as I find them to be lacklustre. The donuts were very soft and springy in texture, but I didn’t like the lingering fried oil smell. The amount of filling was also quite miserable IMO, but well at least they weren’t too sweet overall. Service was welcoming and friendly though! 🍩

Trying out the kuki hojicha tea from @antea.social and it was rather light tasting. Not too astringent at all but the roasted aroma could be more intense! 🍵
