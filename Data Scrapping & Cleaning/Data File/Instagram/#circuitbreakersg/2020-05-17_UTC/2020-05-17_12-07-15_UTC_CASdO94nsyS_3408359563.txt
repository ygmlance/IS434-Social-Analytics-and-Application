Day 41 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (17 May 2020) - #nofilter #easypeasy #quicklunch with #leftover #mcdelivery #mcnuggets (2 pieces) and #mcdonalds drumlets (2 pieces), some chopped peppers, paprika, diced garlic, pepper, pasta water, #penne and #marscapone - next time, I'll set aside the fried chicken bits and add them in to retain the crispiness; still a decently #yummy #homecooking use of #leftovers though
