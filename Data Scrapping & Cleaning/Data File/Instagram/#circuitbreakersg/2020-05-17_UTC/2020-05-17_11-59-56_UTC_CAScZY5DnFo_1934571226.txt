The Circuit Breakers : a series dedicated to our front line superheroes.

#4: to our education officers, teachers and childcare teachers. The dps supports. The people whose importance are unseen but are especially appreciated by the essential workers. Their children are left in the hands of the childcare teachers while they are out and about in the fight against the crown. Also, the education officers who are handling their families while also conducting lessons, crafting lesson plans and creating quizzes and homework for all our children. Thank you! 
All the best to the childcare workers after their swab tests last Friday!
