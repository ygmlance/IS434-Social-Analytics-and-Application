This week, our most supportive Good Folk goes to someone who’s ordered a good 3 times from us the last week — it’s none other than... @riseyenshine !! 🎉🎉🎉
.
We thank all our Good Folks’ constant support throughout this #circuitbreakersg. We will survive through #covid_19 ❤️ & see you real soon.
.
Take care & stay safe everyone! Countdown to the end of CB: 2 weeks!
