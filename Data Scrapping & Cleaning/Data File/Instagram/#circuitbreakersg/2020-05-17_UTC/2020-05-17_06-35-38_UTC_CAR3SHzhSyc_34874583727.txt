Made with organic rolled oats, these are what I call "The Healthier Choice" cookies! Flavoured with peanut butter and dark chocolate chips, they'll satisfy your cookie craving with lesser guilt. Oats are a great source of fibre and antioxidants, and they'll keep you full for longer.

They're only $3/bag, min order of 3 bags! Each bag has about 60g of cookies.
