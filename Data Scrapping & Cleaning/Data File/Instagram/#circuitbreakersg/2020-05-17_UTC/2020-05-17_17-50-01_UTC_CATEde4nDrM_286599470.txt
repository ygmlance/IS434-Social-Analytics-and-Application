I absolutely love it when the kiddos invade our bedroom. Even when they were young, when Fuls was travelling for work , they would share my bed and keep me company 😊 ... but when I was travelling for work, that’s when Fuls enjoyed having the bed all to himself 🤣. Tonight, (or should I say this early morning - being 1.50am) the kiddos are here to snuggle with me while their papa is enjoying a heavy metal  concert on the telly with his Grado open-back wooden headphones 😊 Who else loves a snuggle? ❤️
