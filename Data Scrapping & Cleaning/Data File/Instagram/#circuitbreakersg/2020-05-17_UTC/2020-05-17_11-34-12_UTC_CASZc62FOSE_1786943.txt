Made a refreshing and life-changing drink using Korean melon (참외)! This fruit isn't the sweetest but it still has a nice fragrance of melon! Ate this before in Korea and I was so shocked to see this in a local @finestfoodsg ⁣

Usually, you peel the skin off and eat the fruit together with the seeds. If you don't like the texture (like me), you can always eat it without the seeds. ⁣

As for the ade, making the Korean Melon "concentrate" is the main part. Simply wash the fruit thoroughly, cut into thin slices (as shown in my IGTV) and simply add sugar and mix. I added 3 tablespoons of sugar to half a melon's worth of slices. After leaving it in the fridge overnight, everything would have melted and somehow a lot of juice is produced. ⁣

Add the "concentrate" and some slices to a glass, top off with ice cubes and sparkling water. Enjoy! The drink is bursting with melon's sweetness! Korean Melon is a summer favourite, so it goes perfectly with SG's summer!
