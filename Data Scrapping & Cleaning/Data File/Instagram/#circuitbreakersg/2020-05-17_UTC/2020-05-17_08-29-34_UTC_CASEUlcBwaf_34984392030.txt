🦋Montessori Discovery Basket🐬
.

Anddd the colour of the week is BLUE! J’s “treasure basket”, as he likes to call it, has recently taken on a colour theme. This week, we are focusing on the colour blue. 🐳🐬🐟🐋🦋

I scavenged about the house for any random blue item (preferably natural and non plastic as per the Montessori recommendation), and put them together into his treasure box! Easy peasy- took me but 15 min. The idea is to create a visual impact based on the colour blue so that every time he opens it, he is visually stimulated that way. 🌟

Every week, I do a discovery basket according to a different theme based on his current preferences or learning. I try to include items that will stimulate his different senses, such as shakers, scarves, magnifying glass, and items with different textures. He loves it! In fact, the treasure box is the first item he looks for when he gets up in the morning.🌞

For past discovery baskets, I’ve tried themes like wooden items, basic household items, recycled items, nature etc. And they all stuck to him pretty well. 🌸

What discovery basket are you intending to make for your child? 🌈
