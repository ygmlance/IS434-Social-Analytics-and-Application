; {Circuit Breaker Day 41}

Enjoying a cup of earl grey milk tea. Brewed 2 bags of earl grey, then chilled in the fridge for a few hours, before adding milk and some raw honey that we bought from a makeshift farmerâ€™s market in Georgia ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ª. Iâ€™m sitting on my MUJI chair on the floor, with the curtains drawn, windows opened to let the sunlight and fresh air in.

The white noise of the fan, the chirping of the birds, the occasional ding of notifications from my com, the murmurs of motor engines as vehicle owners make quick stops downstairs, and the whoosh and roar of vehicles speeding down the hill outside the estate. Sometimes, the sounds of human interaction, be it kids laughing, playing, crying, families having a special meal, arguments, karaoke, doing home workout videos.

This has been my set up, my exercise corner, my quiet safe place, my cosy corner, my happy place during this time.

An oasis of serenity amidst the chaos of the world. Something I didnâ€™t think I would have at the start of this circuit breaker.
