🔥 HEAT PLAY 🍳
⚠️ Always supervise our little ones at play ⚠️ Here’s another activity to keep my forever charged Energizer bunnies 🐰🐰 engaged. Yesterday we explored more on eggs 🍳 (always a good idea to start with something they are familiar with) and once they get the hang of things, we explored instant prata (Indian flat bread. Something new for them). Previous times Hu would help to whisk the eggs 🍳 and that’s the furthest I’ll let him explore while Ha will sit in the corner to observe. Yesterday both of them had the opportunity to do everything from start to finish and I couldn’t be more proud of them 💕
Hu's first flipping the prata and his efforts were commendable ♥️♥️ while Ha where do I even begin with her! She’s one gung-ho little lady ♥️♥️. She cooked her egg 🍳 , touched the hot 🔥 pan no drama whatsoever, touched other surfaces to process in her mind which surface is hot and not and proceeded with her task like a pro chef 👩🏻‍🍳 And mind you she’s not even 2 💕
I hope you guys had fun too exploring the kitchen with your little ones. It’s always a joy seeing them having fun at play 💕
