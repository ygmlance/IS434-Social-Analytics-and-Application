Todayâ€™s lunch was exciting as I tried this new one pot  recipe for the very first time. Inspired by what I saw on IG by @thesilverchef this morning, I went ahead and made this. Glad to say it was a hit and will be on my go to list of what to cook for busy mums. #chicken #turmeric #lentils #rice #onepotmeal #forbusymoms #mamamadeitwithlove #newrecipes  #cookingathome #stayhome #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #frommykitchen #mamamadeitwithlove #simplemeals
