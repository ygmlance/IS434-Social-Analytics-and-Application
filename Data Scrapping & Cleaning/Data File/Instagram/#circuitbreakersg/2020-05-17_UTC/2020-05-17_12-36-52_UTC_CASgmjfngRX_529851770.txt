Honestly I've NEVER  thought that I would be doing Tiktok, like not at all. ↯↯↯
BUT! Now I announce Tiktok has officially taken over my life. Just like how this coronavirus has affected our life. Lol. Well, there is both side to every coin. So I'm surprisingly grateful for this CB. I've got the time to unleashed my potentials for acting OR  I might have Bipolar aka Split Personalities Disorder. Because you never know. 🤔😏😎
