Flashback to one year ago when my hair was short and I couldn’t do a strict pull-up! A year down the road and I now know nothing is impossible when I set our heart to it. My favourite quote - “A Champion is once a contender who refused to give up”. I’m nowhere near being a champion but I’ll continue to live by my mantra #decidecommitsucceed .
