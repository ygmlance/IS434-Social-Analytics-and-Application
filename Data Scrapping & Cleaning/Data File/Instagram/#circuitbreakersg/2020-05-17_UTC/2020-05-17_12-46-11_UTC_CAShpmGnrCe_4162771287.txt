Day 41 of circuit breaker (17/5/2020)
.
Sudden heavy rain and strong wind!!! 🌧🌧☔
Suddenly, I was reminded of a song,
"My God Reigns"! 🎼🎵🎶🎸
.
Lyrics:
I have a hope so sure
An anchor for my soul
My peace in the worst of times
I trust in God alone
Let every voice declare it now
My God reigns
His love will never fail me
My God reigns He's ruling over all
In all my life
In every situation I know
My God is greater, my God is over all
.

Yes, my peace and hope are anchored in the Lord in the worst of times because My God reigns and rules over all!!!! .
Be encouraged and blessed! 🙏💖🌈
