☆Unicorn Divine Zoom WS☆
We have a full house today for our inaugural Unicorn Divine Zoom workshop this morning! Unicorn Divine is an original artwork designed by Heart In Hand Atelier, best suited for anyone who needs a bit of magic in their life. 🧚‍♀️

Great thanks and many love to all my lovely participants who chose to join Heart In Hand Atelier on a lazy Sunday morning! While we might have slightly overrun our timing a little and couldn't take a full group photo, I'm very proud of how well everyone has painted given the limitations of online teachings.

I think I might have been abit obsessed with checking everyone's stencils positioning and work progress because I really want each and everyone of you to taste creative success and know that YOU CAN and HAVE IT IN YOU to create. This is Heart In Hand Atelier's promise to you.

All of you have expressed your creativity beautifully in your artworks and I wanna thump my chest and feel like a proud mama. 🤣

Thanks for the special digital connection despite the current situation and I hope my Unicorn Divine has brought some magic stardust into your life and spark some joy 😉
