Day 41 of #circuitbreaker: Mummy, I made a cup of @goldkili Chocolate Gao Siew Dai for you 😘Ian loves this chocolate drink & asks me to try. It is his daily drink while doing his online homework. Mmm this drink has more chocolate malt & is less sweet so I don’t feel so guilty 😋 Check out their limited edition pack which contains a reusable collapsible mug that is so useful for holiday/office :)⁣⁣
