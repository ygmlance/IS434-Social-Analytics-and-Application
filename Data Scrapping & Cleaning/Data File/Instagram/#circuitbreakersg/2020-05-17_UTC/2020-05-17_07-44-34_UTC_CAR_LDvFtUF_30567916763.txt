#circuitbreakersg day 41

Teochew porridge for lunch today even though there’s nothing “teochew” about the dishes. 🤣

We bought some canned food (some only, not a lot 😛) before circuit breaker started and haven’t eaten any of them so we decided to just open a couple of them for lunch today. The dishes were:

1️⃣ Canned sardines
2️⃣ Pan fried canned luncheon meat
3️⃣ Mussels in wine white sauce (leftover from yesterday)
4️⃣ Sunny side up eggs .
.

Lunch was very simple yet so comforting. And I’m grateful for that. Reminds me of porridge lunches with my family when I was young. #gratitudediary
