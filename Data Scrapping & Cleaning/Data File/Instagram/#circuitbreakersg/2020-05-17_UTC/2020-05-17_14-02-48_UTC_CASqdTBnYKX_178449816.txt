Day 41 of #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Husband decided to make sausage casserole today. But since we didn’t have enough potatoes, we used pumpkin as well. Haven’t bought pumpkin in the longest time because I don’t really know what to do with it aside from mashing it and feeding it to @edward365 when he was still a baby.
.
This method of mixing potato and pumpkin together is really good. Firstly reduce on carbs, and increase intake of fibre. And it provides a natural sweetness to the dish too. We made enough for dinner tomorrow night!
