#cbday40 bak kut teh noodle soup for lunch and tauhu goreng with bak kut teh soup for dinner. Added carrots and Chinese yam (淮山) to the broth so it was pleasingly “sweet”. The tauhu goreng gravy is made by melting 2 tbsp of gula melaka in about 200ml of water and adding some sambal, calamansi juice and soy sauce. Then thickened with some cornstarch and topped with grounded peanuts. Very easy but delish. .
