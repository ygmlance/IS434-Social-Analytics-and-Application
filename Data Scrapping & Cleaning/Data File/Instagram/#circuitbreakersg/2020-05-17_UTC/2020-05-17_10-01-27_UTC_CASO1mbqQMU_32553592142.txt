GLUTE ACTIVATION 🍑🔥👍🏻⁣⠀
⁣⠀
Here’s a great activation workout to do using a simple resistance band ideal to switch on those glutes allowing them to fire up before a Strength workout. ⁣⠀
⁣⠀
These exercises will certainly strengthen and sculpt those glutes but to increase muscle mass and real strength weight training is your answer 💪🏼⁣⠀
