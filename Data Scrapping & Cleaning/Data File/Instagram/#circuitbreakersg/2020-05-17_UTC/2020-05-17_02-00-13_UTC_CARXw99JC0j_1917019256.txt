Dear FAM,

It is finally our turn.
Thank you for all your patience.

Sterilisation (spay and neutering) for your pets is finally allowed w.e.f. 16 May 2020, 0000Hrs.

We have to start SafeEntry already, so you have to bring your identity cards when you come in for physical consultation for your pets.

Everything else (mask, temperature check, social distancing, no gathering, etc) still apply.

To help you decide if a concern about your pet requires a physical assessment or not, call us at 62433282.

Please tag all your friends, relative and acquaintances with pets.
