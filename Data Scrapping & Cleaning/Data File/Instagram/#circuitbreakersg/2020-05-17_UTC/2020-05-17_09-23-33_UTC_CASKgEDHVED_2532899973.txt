Sunday bakes: Pineapple Tarts.  Sadly, I am only able to get about 60 pieces of this. I don’t have time to get more pineapples or make more of this now. It’s tiring. I wish I had the original crimper for the tarts so can sepit nicely. Also, this won’t last. Sense of smell seeking hidden pineapple tarts in this house is remarkable. I think I’ll just make one more kueh and I’m done. Maybe...
