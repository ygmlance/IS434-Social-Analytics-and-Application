@joeyjedisaac and I were trying to figure out what to have for dinner when someone came knocking at the door. 🧐

Joey relunctantly opened the door, and I could literally see a big❓on that “wth” face seeing a very familiar #Jollibee paperbag when we didn’t order anything for tonight’s #Iftar. 🕌 So we checked with the #GrabRider if he had gotten the correct address, and yes -confirmed it was ours but the order was from a certain “Ivan”! 🤔 @irvinyap, the rider mispronounced your name but we immediately realised that it was from you! ☺️ Thank you for the pleasant surprise! Saved us so much time planning & preparing #dinner and we could just #chillandrelax while waiting to break our fast! 🍗🍝🌽 #surprisedelivery #jollibeesg #circuitbreakersg #breakingfastmeal
