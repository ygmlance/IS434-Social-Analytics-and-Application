10 May, Dinner - Our mum took a break from being our food tester on Mother's Day so we ordered in. We also really wanted to have some egg fooyoung for a while now so it's the perfect time! It's a really simple dish but requires so many different ingredients it's kinda hard to make at home. Of course we have the classic sweet and sour pork and garlic vegetable stirfry too. In the end we couldn't resist and made some sambal asparagus too XD
