DAY 40, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
BLACK PEPPER ROASTED CHICKEN

Lunch today was this super duper easy roasted chicken. I marinated the whole chicken in store bought black pepper sauce, light soy sauce, lemon juice &  minced garlic for 1 hour. Cooked it in the oven at 200Â°C for 30 min, covered with aluminium foil. Bake mode. Then removed the foil and changed the oven setting to roast for another 15 min to get that crisp skin. Full of flavour, juicy roast chicken. Can't get easier than this!
