How we're spending our days stuck at home - 
This inflatable kayak has traveled with us to New Zealand and taken us on a few adventures. Now it serves as an inflatable pool for a toddler who is bored at home cos we've had to work and can't play with him. Gotta get creative you know ðŸ›¶
And when we can breathe easier after the restrictions lift, Mr. Stripey here is going to get swimming lessons.
