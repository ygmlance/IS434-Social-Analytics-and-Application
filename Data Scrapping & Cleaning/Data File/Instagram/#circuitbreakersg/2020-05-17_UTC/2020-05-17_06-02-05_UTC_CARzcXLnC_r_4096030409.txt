Baby White Bok Choy or Milk Cabbage; is one of my favourite vegetables at the moment. I lost track how many times I had this vegetable since the ‘circuit breaker’ started. I made sure to cook a different style/version each time. Today’s version is one that I blanched the vegetable first and soak in ice water to ensures the vegetable stays crisp. Accompanied with a tasty broth from shiro dashi, sake, dried scallop, corn and goji berries making up the rest. Healthy and high in antioxidants too. .
