We had missed the run of multi-award winning movie “Parasite” in the cinemas, so we decided to catch it yesterday on Apple TV. I told the Hubz that I would prepare a special dinner for us after the movie. .

So this is what I made! #jjapaguri aka #ramdon! I’ve never been a fan of #jjajangmyeon but this combined with the #neoguri #ramen was such a match made in heaven! Adding the beef cubes in was just genius. And then I fried some eggs & added on #kimchi, which made the Hubz even more pleased with the meal. 😋

Thank you #Parasite for introducing such an amazing dish. It’s elevated ramen at its finest. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 .
