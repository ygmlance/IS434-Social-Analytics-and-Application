I'm sure every single Pinoy has eaten Spanish Bread at least once in their lives! 😋 With that being said (mema haha), here's my take on #SpanishBread! I remember as a chubby kid, I hated it when neighborhood bakeries scrimped on the filling so mine is supersized deluxe version hahaha 🤣😋😁. #covidbaking
