Our mini weekend project 🤩🤩⁣
⁣
A few days ago, we decided to shift the TV into our room as we do not allow Ashlyn to watch TV and have been underutilizing the TV ever since Ashlyn was born. This left a bare wall and empty space in our living room. ⁣
⁣
After facing the empty wall for a few days, we decided to add more colors to the wall and convert it into a new play area for Ashlyn. It was a tiring process but thankful that it turned out the way we imagined it to be 😍 Ashlyn also got an unexpected art lesson as we got her to join in the painting activity 👍🏻👍🏻⁣
