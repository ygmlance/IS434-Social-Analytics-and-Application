lawns lay uncut since #circuitbreakersg and wild flowers popping up and growing abundant, what a sight to behold 
Dear #neasingapore can we have such beauties growing free and abundant , and only cutting the grass periodically? The amount of butterflies I saw was also truly wonderful this not only adds to the biodiversity of Singapore but also provide the butterflies and bees with food  #wildflowers #circuitbreakerday41
