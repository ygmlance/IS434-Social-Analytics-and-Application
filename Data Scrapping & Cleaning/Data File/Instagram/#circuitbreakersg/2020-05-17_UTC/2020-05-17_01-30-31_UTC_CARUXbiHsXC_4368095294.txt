🥜CB Day41 - Breakfast🧀
.
A changed in the usual weekend Breakfast ☀️
.
I think my Mum 👩🏻‍🦱 cannot take it too with nothing but noodles again... ... She went out to get something different 😂 while we are still sleeping coz all of us overslept... ...
.
Not a fan of "Min Jiang Kueh", but refreshing enough to not eat noodles again😘
.
I know I'm a difficult fella to please🤣🤣🤣
.
Happy Sunday Everybody ❣️❣️❣️
