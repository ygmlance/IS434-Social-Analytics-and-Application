💖Sambal Grilled Chicken💖

Love the charred crispy edges of my chicken skin. I do eat the skin if it yummy kay... 😜 Saturated animal fat ain’t entirely bad. Excess of anything is bad. The most evil fat is trans fat mostly found in processed food and fast food! Anyways, the chicken thigh meat was soft and juicy. 💓

Sauteed cabbage was crunchy and had a nice charred taste. 😍
