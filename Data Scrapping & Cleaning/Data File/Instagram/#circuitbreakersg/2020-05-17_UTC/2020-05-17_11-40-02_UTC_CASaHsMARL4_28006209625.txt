| Caving craving? | "Are we there yet?"
"Oo, let's stop. This looks like a perfect rest stop." ðŸ¥´

Story of my life when I go caving, trekking or hiking with my not-so-atheletic or not-so-adventurous friends. ðŸ™ƒ

A part of me dies each time we turn around before reaching the destination. "I think we should head back, it's getting late." "Yea, I agree." Another part of me wants to strangle them and say, "Well, it wouldnt be this late if we didnt take that many rest stops!!" ðŸ˜ ðŸ”ª Scroll to see BTS! Found this perfect spot by chance. 
P.s. friends who have travelled with me and been in such a situation, just know that I still love you. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ If not I would have left your lazy asses and gone to the end point by myself.
