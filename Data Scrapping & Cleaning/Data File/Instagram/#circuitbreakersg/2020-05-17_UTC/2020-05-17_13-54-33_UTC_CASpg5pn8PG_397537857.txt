#CircuitBreakerSG D-41

Baked the almost-forgotten half-shell Scallop tonight. Mixed some butter, mayo, salt & pepper to spread on the scallops & topped with shredded cheese before sending into the oven.

Rotisserie Chicken on repeat mode because we didn't have enough last week. Did a lemon Rosemary flavour this time and some vegetable medley underneath to catch the flavourful drippings.

The carb for tonight was Garlic Bread. Blended some Garlic with Olive Oil, Parsley & Salt to spread on baguette. Sprinkled with sesame seeds and sent into the oven.

Both ovens have worked so hard for us tonight ðŸ˜… Enjoy your dinner too ðŸ˜‹
