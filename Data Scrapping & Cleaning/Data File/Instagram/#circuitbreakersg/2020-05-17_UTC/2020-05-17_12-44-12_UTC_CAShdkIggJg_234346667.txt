【Recipe】Sunday specials; Fried chicken and oven roasted vegetables😋🍗🥦 #honeybeeweekendmeals 
Such an enjoyable meal😋 Crunchy fried skin and tender flavourful chicken meat. And if you haven’t noticed, I love roasted vegetables! 
Potatoes are par-boiled for 10 mins. Sliced and seasoned with salt, pepper, smoky paprika, EVOO, garlic and onion powder. Sriracha mayo for dipping. 
Trying another marinade for the chicken this time and it’s pretty good. But it does require at least 2hrs in the marinade for a more flavourful finish. 
Watch how I cook this meal in my IGS. #honeybeecooksthaistylefriedchicken
