Today, we decided to make Muah Chee for our snack time! Out of all the other things we do, this is one thing that brings us the most joy as all of us could make something together. This is something that we don’t get to do very often as our parents are always busy with work and don’t have much time to spend playing or cooking with us, hence this time used to make Muah Chee is precious as it allowed us to bond as a family. Muah Chee is made up of different ingredients, each representing each one of us in the family. When it is mixed together, a sticky paste is formed, representing our bonding and closeness as a family. The last step is to stick the nuts around a smaller portion of the paste, representing the things we can achieve together as a family. Many things we cannot do as a person alone, but when we stick together and do things together, we can achieve much more than what we could originally do as a person. With all these being said, making Muah Chee together has created joyous memories for our family.
