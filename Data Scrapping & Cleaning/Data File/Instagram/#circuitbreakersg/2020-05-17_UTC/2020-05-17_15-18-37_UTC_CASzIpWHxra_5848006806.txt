First batch of cream puffs made! The little miss spent the afternoon making cream puffs with her gran and it was a success. Even the little man who was dressed by his sis chipped in and had fun stirring the custard. Loved seeing my almost 8-year-old bond with my mum over my gran’s recipes. And while she learnt a thing or two about this recipe, she didn’t forget to teach her gran - or Nanny as she calls her - some important life hacks and all about YouTubers. .
While the sweet girl gave up after filling up the first tray, my mum and I continued baking and we were reminded of the countless family gatherings where these are always a hit. While we don’t get to see each other as often as we like, we’re glad we still get to stay in touch with everyone that’s important to us during these difficult times. Missing my family dearly. ❤️
