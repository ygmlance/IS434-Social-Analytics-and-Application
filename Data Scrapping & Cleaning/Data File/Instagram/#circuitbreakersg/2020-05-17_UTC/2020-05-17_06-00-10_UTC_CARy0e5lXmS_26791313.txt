Hi everyone! I'm back with another video 😃 This time I wanted to help you decide on which Financial Plans are the most essential to have. This is a question that I'm often asked so I thought it'd be best to address it via this video 😉 I've listed the 4 most important plans to me & they are Hospitalisation, Personal Accident, Critical Illness & Savings plans respectively. These are the fundamental plans (in my opinion of course 😅) that everyone needs to enquire more about and look at getting when they talk about becoming Financially secure. 
0.47 - Hospitalisation Plan

2.00 - Personal Accident Plan

3.08 - Critical Illness Plan

4.50 - Savings Plan
