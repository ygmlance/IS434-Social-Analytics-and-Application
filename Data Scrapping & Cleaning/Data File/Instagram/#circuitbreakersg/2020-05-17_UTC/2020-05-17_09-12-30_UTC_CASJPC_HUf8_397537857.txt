#CircuitBreakerSG D-41

I'm so delighted to receive a homemade cake during this period. The Cream Cheese Sponge Cake baked by my dearest sis @septgrace is super soft & yummy.

Yes, I bake cakes but I'm also thankful to receive, #Ineedlovetoo 🤭

Remember 7 years ago when my beautiful neighbour @nanasuzlim came knocking on the door with her homemade butter cake. I was so touched & almost in tears to receive my 1st homebaked birthday cake. Miss you guys 😍

Thanks girls, appreciate it 🥰

P.s No, it's not my birthday... yet 😅 #justthankful
