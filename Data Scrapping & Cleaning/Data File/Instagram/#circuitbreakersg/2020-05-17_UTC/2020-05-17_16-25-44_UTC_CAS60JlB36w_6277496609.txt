"I've worn a mask every day of my life... and it was all to create a version of myself that the world would accept. But I'm done." -
If you don't know where that quote is from, I'm not gonna tell you. But epic, epic speech OMG. What a finale.

What has that got to do with this photo of a kueh lapis?
.
Well... I've been wanting to make kueh lapis since the start of the fasting month but I couldn't find the 'correct' colours. After visiting many shops and malls (all 'sold out), I came across one shop that carried bottles of food colouring but only in one colour - yes, purple.
.
Then I thought to myself why was I fussing over the colours when what really matters were the ingredients that form the DNA of the kueh. Why do we have to paint ourselves in the 'correct' colours before we can be accepted by others?
.
Red, green, white ... or purple, it's still the same sweet, sticky, lemak-ish, steamed layered cake that is just so delectable with tea or coffee. Jemput makan (bon appetit). .
