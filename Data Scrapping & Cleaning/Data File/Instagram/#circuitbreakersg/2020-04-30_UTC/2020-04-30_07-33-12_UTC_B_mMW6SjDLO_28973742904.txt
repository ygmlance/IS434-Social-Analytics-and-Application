Never would I imagined that bottles of kimchi would fly off the shelves of supermarkets in Singapore. Thankfully, I always have 1-2 bottles of kimchi in the fridge - to be enjoyed on its own, add to our favourite spicy ramyeon or a quick stir fry. It has now become a prized ingredient during the #circuitbreakersg as it stores well and is such a versatile ingredient.

For today’s lunch, I’ve made some easy stir fried udon with kimchi and thinly sliced beef.
