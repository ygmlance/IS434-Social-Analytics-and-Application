no bake blueberry cheesecake!! love making no bakes bc who can not resist cold dessert?? ðŸ¤— except it takes a while to make since the layers need time to set in the fridge so gotta be patient! altho this time iz a perfect example of how bakes donâ€™t always go well...cheesecake started becoming melty a while after taking it out of the fridge ðŸ˜« probs should have added more gelatin powder but just gonna document this here hopefully next time will be better!
