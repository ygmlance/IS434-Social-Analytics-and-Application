The highlight for this evening is the Sweet & Sour Red Snapper Fillet from @9sseafood.  5 years, since we move back this is my very FIRST fried fish.  You've seen fishes in steamer, airfryer, oven, casserole but never on the pan/wok.  I dislike the spattering oil, the aroma of fried fish lingering in the house.  Today's frying was a breeze, coated the fillet with some flour before sliding it into the pan.  The cooker hood was on full power, ventilation fan on & the kitchen door shut... hahaha... whatever it takes to avoid the smell... and now the candle lamp switched on 😁 
Tonight's dinner is made up of Sweet & Sour Red Snapper Fillet, Stir-fry You Mai, Stir-fry Kicap Brinjal & last evening leftovers Lemak Chicken.

Time to chill & enjoy the eve of PH ...listen to ah gong speech while I wait for the 830 TVB drama.
