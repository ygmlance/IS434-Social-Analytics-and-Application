It's been a few weeks since I last uploaded an art work of mine because I was having a creative block but this time around I pushed myself through because I missed inking.

Going to embark on doing a twisted version of every Disney character ever (let's hope I have the diligence to)

One thing I'm looking forward to is, that 4 more weeks til circuit breaker ends! Meaning that we are (almost but not as bad as 1.5 months) there!
