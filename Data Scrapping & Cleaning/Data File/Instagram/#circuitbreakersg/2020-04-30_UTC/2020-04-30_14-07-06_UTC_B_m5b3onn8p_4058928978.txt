Before this amazing 😉 and awesome APRIL month draws to a close, I just wanna take this time to thank each and every single of you excellent acquaintances, besties, coworkers and cousins for your lovely, splendid, light hearted and thoughtful well wishes, greetings and regards throughout the past few days. I can’t begin to tell you how much they made my day indeed. I must admit that the number of wishes and blessings flowing in from different social media and communication channels and platforms have been quite remarkable, phenomenal and overwhelming. Thank you 🙏 so much from the bottom of my heart for making this awesome APRIL day a little more special and exciting experience to savour especially during these trying, challenging and unprecedented times. Who would have thought that this year’s birthday 🎂 celebrations 🎉🥳 would turn out to be such a low key, muted, toned down and somewhat unconventional affair considering that this wasn’t exactly my ideal kind of setting which I had planned to commemorate the occasion in the first place. It certainly wasn’t part of the script too! However I am eternally thankful and blessed for all the love 💕 and blessings received from each and everyone of you guys and gals (yes you know who are!!) and I wanna take this time to send them all back to you!! On behalf of those who are celebrating 🥳 their birthdays 🎂 in the month of APRIL, i sincerely hope that you all would be able to have an enjoyable, unforgettable, delightful and pleasant experience this year. Plenty of things are gonna get worse before they become any better. We could not have picked such a strange time to be celebrating and remembering our birthdays in this manner. Remember to hold your head up high and continue to stay strong 💪, safe, healthy, vigilant, calm and positive as always. Don’t worry 😉 we are in this together and we shall overcome this COVID19 battle as one united team. Hope to see you all around very soon once this ordeal is over. With much love 💕, joy, peace ✌️ and blessings!!! 😇🤩😊☺️🙂😌🤗🙏 #Stayhomebirthdaycelebration. #SGUnited. #GoodbyeApril. #Thankful. #Blessed. #Foreveryoungatheart. #ThanksforthememoriesApril. #CircuitbreakerSG.
