This is me.

Watching my human as she falls asleep.
Sometimes there are good days where she seems happy and does silly dances.

Others when she seems to be hungry and cries like how I would, for food.

No matter what day it may be, I will continue to watch over her as she does for me. (except times when she is incessantly nagging and shouting at me for killing the black long worms near the tv)
