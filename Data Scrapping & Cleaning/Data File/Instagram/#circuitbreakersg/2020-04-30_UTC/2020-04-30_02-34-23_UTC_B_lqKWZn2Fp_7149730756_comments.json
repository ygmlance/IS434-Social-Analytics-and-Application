You have been a loyal employee in your job for the past 35 years. Given at the age of 6\ufe0f\u20e30\ufe0f\u20e3, you seldom complain about being lethargic even when you need to take care of your grandchildren  during your post-retirement stage.\n2) Teacher\nYou always willingly share your knowledge and principles to help us grow and develop over the years. You never allow us to take things for granted and always remind us to cherish what we have at the present. From the food on the table to the good education you have paid for, you will make us appreciate the values in everything we have!\n3) Friend\nYou naturally show kindness, compassion and interest in our family. Whenever you are \ud83c\udd93, you will spare some time to listen to us and have a good chat with us. You are just like everyone's best friend in the family! \n4) Exemplar\nYou show by the way you live an example of what the family stands for. You will not smoke if you don't want us to do it, and likewise does not drink heavily if you do not want us to do so. You taught us to deal with conflict in our family and with others by being firm but reasonable at the same time! \n5) Patriarch\nYou are honoured because of your moral character and actions. You don't expect us to live the same kind of life you do, and do the same kind of work. You respected our values and opinions, as long as they don't harm the family or anyone else! \n6) Disciplinarian\nYou helped us learn proper boundaries and consequences. You will strongly disapprove any of our misdeeds by using tough love to prove a point. You did this through the power of your words, not your fists. Likewise, you don't reward us for actions that are expected of us, such as helping with house chores or performing well in school!\nThank you for all the selfless sacrifices \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\nI LOVE \ud83d\udc9f YOU MUM \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8b\n@potatoeeeez_ @kwok.james @hing.yuen.52",

My mum will save every single bit of goodness to us and provides us with everything as much as she can. She gave up the most important things in her life, so that I could take on the most important things in mine. Thankful for all the sacrifices she has made, as well as the unconditional love she has showered upon me through these years! \ud83e\udd70\nBest friends come and go, boyfriends and girlfriends love and move on, but the only person present through it all is a mother.\nNow that she's old, we all are grown up and have stable job, I want to show her appreciation and gratitude every day possible. Without her unconditional love and care, we wouldn\u2019t be who we are today!! She is also my Best Friend who listen to my problem & share my worries & happiness. Grateful for her everything. \ud83e\udd70 \nThank you for the thoughtful giveaway! \u2764\ufe0f\nHope to win this because she is frugal and doesn\u2019t want me to splurge on her.

She is the most supportive and most loving mom out there. \u2764\ufe0f I never knew how much she sacrificed and how much she had done for me all these years before I became a mother myself.  She had to bring up 5 kids all by herself. Those though times were hard and we did not have much money, but she was a great mom and took care of us all very well. I didn\u2019t know how difficult it is to be a mom but now I totally feel it and experience it firsthand for myself.  Being a mom definitely is not an easy job. Yet she never complained or made a sound. It was all love and smiles. I really want to be like a mom her but I find it very hard. She is a perfect mom. I can never say enough or ever express fully in words on how much I love her and show how great she is\u2764. Mother's Day is meant to make mothers happy and show great appreciation to our mothers. \u2764 This giveaway is perfect for my dearest mom. I am sure she will be very happy if I can win this gift for her. She is a great mom and she deserves to have the best. \ud83d\udcaf\ud83e\udd47 @ic_life8 @momo_album @friendly_kat",

She is a #powermom!\u00a0\n@kenbean3 @chl5701 @movieslover101",

She has been in my life since I was born and she will always be in my life no matter what happens. She is the one who has suffered to bring me into this world. I have learnt to love her from the day I was born.\nMy mother was the first person to teach me to draw and walk, and she was with me when I took my first step ever! She has taught me to believe in people and not to have grudges against one another. She always encouraged me to go along when I was ready to give up. She makes sure that I was safe and happy throughout my childhood. It is the unconditional love that my mother feels that drives these feelings.\nIt is hard to describe the feeling that a mother has towards her children. Mothers give an awful lot of support to their children, whether it involves very visible support or simple background encouragement. Not only do mothers support their children, but they also often hold the whole family structure together. When all is well, a mother puts her children before anything else, including their own comfort and happiness. Describing a mother's love is virtually impossible. It is a feeling that can only truly be understood by those that experience it.

Her number one piece of advice is to let her grandchildren be sad.\u00a0In the scope of an adolescent\u2019s life, these are major losses. This is bigger for them than it is for us adults because we\u2019re measuring it against our lifetime and experience. She will support, expect and normalize that they are very sad and very frustrated about the losses they are mourning.When in doubt, she will offer empathy and support. Throughout this period, she understand that there is a lot of misinformation circulating about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As such, she will spend time to find out what her grandkids are hearing or what they think is true. She feels that it is not enough to just tell her grandchildren accurate facts, because if they have picked up something that is inaccurate, if she doesn't find out what they are thinking and directly address the misunderstanding, they may combine the new information she gives them with the old information they have. Hence, she will find out what her grandkids already know and start from there in terms of getting them on the right track. When her grandchildren have questions she can\u2019t answer, instead of guessing, she uses it as an opportunity to explore the answers together. My mother is a healer and it is very entertaining (to me) to see her interaction with her grandkids!

Everyday without fail , she ensure all her kids have good meals and ensure her husband have good meals too as we are a big family , she cooked ,she clean up our house and give is a wonderful house ! And also a family whoa are closed enough ! She herself is not educated so she will not blame us on our studies if we did badly ! But still nevertheless she help us in basic words ! But all her 4 kids done her proud , because 4 kids get good results and always top 10 in class without any guidance from parents or tuition ! She give us the best in our life ! For instance when we are young , we might not be rich but my mum will work and get her pay to buy the things we want ! And also everytime when i was in kindergarten , she will bring me to school and fetch me off from school . A mum like her is hard to find , a lady who love her family and willing to give the best ! She is still the one helping me looking after baby because during my after birth , i almost get onto depression but mummy is the one who sacrifice all her time and sleep to help me look after baby till now . So i think she is really a superwoman who deserve a reward . And what's more she help me throughout pregnancy , after birth and confinement and now still helping me looking after baby everyday and night while i went out to work. Her love to me and baby is unconditional love and same to me i love her like how she love us but \nWords cant describe much but still got to say happy mother day ! So hope to win and surprise her ! @xxbeexx__ @kanglaychoo @limkahkoon",
