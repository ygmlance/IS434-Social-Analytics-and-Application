When I was still taking the kids to kindy (back in the day - a month ago ;p), the car was a pretty conducive place to pray together. There were no distractions, and the pace of the day had not yet caught up with us. And we started a habit of having the kids hold hands to pray for each other in the car (which helped them to focus better!).
.
Those were short, simple prayers:
"Thank You God for a brand new day!"
"Please help brother to speak up in class,"
"Please help Jie Jie for her spelling today,"
.
Now that we are staying home all the time, we've formed other habits, and I've also included in their morning routine a time for them to read their Bible and pray on their own, and they've started doing it unprompted sometimes - and I'm so grateful and glad (add to it the fact that I am really not a morning person)!
.
God hears our prayer wherever we are - what matters more is that we set our hearts and thoughts on Jesus. Teaching our kids this truth lets them know that we can speak to Him from anywhere. Powerful prayers can be lifted from anywhere! .
