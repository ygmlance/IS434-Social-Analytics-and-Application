30.04.20 Dinner - Stir fried Yangchun noodles 🍜 and yakitori 🍢  Guessed I need to master how to fry these noodles because they had a really flour-y taste. Thank god we had the Yakitori to save the meal 😅 #whaticook #whatimade #dinner #Yangchunnoodles #yakitori #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #橘子麻麻的廚房 #自己做 #晚餐 #炒陽春麵 #日式串燒 #防疫 #隔離生活 #煮婦人生
