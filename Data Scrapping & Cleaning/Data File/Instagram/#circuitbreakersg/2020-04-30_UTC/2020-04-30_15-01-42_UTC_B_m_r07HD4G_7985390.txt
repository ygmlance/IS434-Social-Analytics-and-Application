It’s coming to a month since the circuit breaker started. Has it been tough? Yes and No. My routine was definitely upset because the boys are home 24/7. Making sure they do their work, while cooking meals, doing laundry and working at the same time is definitely a challenge 🤦‍♀️ That being sad, I did get to work on my culinary skills 🥘🍔🥗 since I have to cook more often. I also get to know what exactly the boys are learning as I get to see what they learn and also render help when necessary. I get to spend more time with them and play games 💕. My hubby is home helping out a lot. So there’s plenty of up-side to this circuit breaker. 
I also got to online meet my friends a little more often which we  usually only meet in person once many few months or even once a year. 
But the best part is I did get to do more self development. There are many virtual self care classes like meditation, women circle, breathing etc. 
The one that I enjoy a lot is actually my Mary Kay online classes ⭐️🌈hosted by my MK sisters. I actually learn many skincare tips and especially make up know-how’s. If you know me, you know I don’t really put on make up. And that’s because I don’t really know how to. Now, I am happy putting on colours with confidence. 
And for the next 13 days, I am embarking on the MK Power ⚡️ Of 13 challenge. I think this is a great exercise to show gratitude, love and hope. ❤️
