Living through a pandemic could be especially stressful for migrant workers, who are living in a foreign country away from their families. As such, Letâ€™s Spread The Love (SG), started by @sugarfreesaccharin, is a small fundraiser that aims to raise funds for our dearest migrant workers who have helped build our nation.

For each donation of $5 or more, donors can also choose to redeem an E-card of their choice! All designs are illustrated by @sugarfreesaccharin, and 100% of the proceeds will go to Transient Workers Count Too (@twc2). Do visit @sugarfreesaccharin for more information!
