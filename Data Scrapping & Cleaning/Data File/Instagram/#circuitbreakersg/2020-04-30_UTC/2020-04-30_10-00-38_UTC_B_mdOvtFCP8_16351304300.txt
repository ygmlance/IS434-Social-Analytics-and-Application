Ajumma’s, which means ‘Aunty’ in Korean focuses on serving classic Korean food that isn’t too expensive. Surprisingly, the person behind Ajumma’s is neither middle aged nor female.  We spoke to Dominic to find out more. Here’s what he shared with us. 
I started Ajumma’s when I was 22 leaving university to pursue a career in F&B. We decided to focus on selling Classic Korean food that isn’t too expensive without compromising on quality. Ajumma's represents the love and dedication we put into making sure our stocks, sauces, marinades are all made fresh from scratch daily. 
When asked how the current COVID-19 situation has affected business, he said while COVID-19 poses challenges (decrease footfall + exorbitant commissions & high delivery charges), he’s thankful they managed to set up an island-wide delivery for their regular customers.  If you want to help local FNB Businesses, order from them every once in awhile! Every order counts!  Ajumma’s is open for takeaways and island-wide delivery.
