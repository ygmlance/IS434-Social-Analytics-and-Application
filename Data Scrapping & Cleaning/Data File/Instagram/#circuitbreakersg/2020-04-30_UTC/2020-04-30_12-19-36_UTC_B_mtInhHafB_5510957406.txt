.
God's Voice Within, written by Mark E. Thibodeaux. 📖
.
📚 It contains 230 pages.
📚 Mark talks about the concept of discernment and the different terms used such as Agere contra, consolation and desolation.
📚  In the book, he teaches Ignitian discernment, to be self aware and that discernment is a process of prayer, learning and applying.
.
“I liked that the book simplifies the concepts of discernment, and gives examples of real life stories. It breaks down step by step how to do God's will in our daily lives, through laying a foundation or reflection, such as asking ourselves what we seek, and reminds us that the ultimate purpose is for God's greater glory.” ~ Alessandrya
