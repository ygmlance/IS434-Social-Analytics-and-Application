30 APR 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 24

Day 24 - #circuitbreakersg 🏘🏠
Last day of #April 2020 and we spent most of the days in #circuitbreaker mode. It is also uncertain how long this is going to last. But we have to keep our body and mind strong and healthy.
⛈🌧
Loving the cool weather from the heavy downpour earlier. I guess during this period, mother nature is also taking a breather.
