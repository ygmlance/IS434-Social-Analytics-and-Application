Unilateral Exercises 💪🏼 Read on for more 👇🏼

Why unilateral exercises?
⁣
𝟭. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲. For bodyweight exercises, increasing the resistance you work with is not so straightforward, short of putting on weight. Unilateral exercises is one way of increasing resistance - a one-arm pushup is definitely going to load your working arm more than a two-arm pushup. Increased resistance means more strength and muscle gains, so unilateral exercises are a good way to progress in bodyweight training. ⁣

𝟮. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆. In bilateral exercises, you will feel much more stable than in unilateral exercises. The more points of contact you have with the surface you are pushing/pulling against, the less you will have to contend with rotational forces. By reducing the points of contact you have, you are challenging the stabilisers a lot more in unilateral exercises, and hence they are a good way to build stability.

How to progress on to unilateral exercises? ⁣
⁣
𝟭. 𝗕𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗿𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀. Build a strong foundation in bilateral movements before progressing on to their unilateral versions. If you can't rep out normal pushups and squats, you shouldn't be attempting their unilateral variants. ⁣

𝟮. "𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗯𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗹𝗸". My preferred approach is to build strength and stability in static unilateral positions before attempting movement. For the one-arm push up, adopt a normal pushup position - with legs splayed further apart for balance - and remove one hand from the floor. Do the same, but for the bottom of the pushup position. Hold these positions for time - 60s is good. You will naturally be able to do a one-arm push up when you are strong and stable in these static unilateral positions. Similarly for the pistol squat, be comfortable holding a standing and full squat position with one leg. If you can do these, the pistol is not far off. The principle is this: if you can hold the start and end positions, the movement in between should take care of itself.

Try these out for those strength and stability gains!
