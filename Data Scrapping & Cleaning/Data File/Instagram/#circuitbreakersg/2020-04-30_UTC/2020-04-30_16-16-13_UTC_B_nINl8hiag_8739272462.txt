Day 26

Some of my friends are counting down the days till the circuit breaker (lockdown) ends. Others have said that they have stopped counting. I find myself in a repetitive routine, cooking alot, which means cleaning alot, which showering alot. Rinse and repeat. A lot of rinsing. 
I am wondering when I will be able to go meet my friends. I don't need fancy restaurants or going to the movies. I just want to have the joy of seeing good people and sharing in their lives. 
Of course our community needs to ride the wave out - reduce the number of cases so that medical resources are not tied up and the risk of getting covid just by going out in public needs to be much lower. However a rational reason does not go far with the way our human brain works. A part of our brain will always crave immediate gratification - we inherited it from reptiles. 
Today's tip is to practice a little patience. And patience is a practice - like a muscle it can be grown.

Studies show that confidence that an expected outcome will eventually occur is a central quality for patience. As Buddhists say "This too shall pass." The waiting period for it to be safer to go out will end. Be clear that in any task, you will achieve reasonable success after enough attempts to work something out. 
In the meantime, slow down as you do any task you undertake and observe what you are doing and how you are doing. You might notice some tension or stress. Take a moment to let it go. 
Elminate tasks that are not important to you. Instead focus on goals you truly want to achieve and take small individual steps towards them. Start the day with a task that is simple and reasonably easy to accomplish. This gives you satisfaction so you can put aside reaching for gratification (like sugar or the tv remote) first.

Over time, your ability to observe your actions and stay calm will improve.

Above all be safe and well.
