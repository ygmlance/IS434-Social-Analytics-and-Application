#circuitbreakersg day 24

2 pieces of pork chop, 2 sausages, 2 eggs and some fries. This was what I had for lunch one day when I visited Spain many years ago in 2012. I think this could be hardly described as a typical Spanish meal but I had great memories of this meal. I remember there were 2 locals sitting near us during lunch and they had 🍺 followed by☕️ followed by🥃 in that one sitting. And that was when I thought to myself, “ahhh so this is how life should be enjoyed...!” 😝

Even though we can’t travel now, we can certainly re-create the memories of our holidays. This is my attempt at re-creating that meal, while reminiscing the lovely memories I have of that trip to Spain. 😌Swipe left to see a photo of that actual meal. 😄

The original meal was paired with a Pepsi drink (not in photo) but I have paired this meal with Coke Light since I only have this at home. Are you a coke or Pepsi person? 😀

Today, I’m grateful that I had the chance to travel to other parts of the 🌎 and I’m hopeful that things will eventually get better. 🙏 #gratitudediary .
