👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 CROQUET 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
I love that this #familygame 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 provides many opportunities for our little ones to follow directions, stay focus and teaches them to persevere in order to use the mallets or their hands 🖐🏼 🤚🏼 (we tried that for added fun) to hit the wooden balls through the hoops. 
Watching my family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 laugh 🤣, bond 🥰, sweating 😅 it out and having fun together despite of not seeing the sun ☀️ feels like ages ago, made #stayinghome 🏠 worthwhile 💕 
May all of us have countless of precious moments like these to hold on tight for a brighter tomorrow. Take care and stay safe always 💕 .
