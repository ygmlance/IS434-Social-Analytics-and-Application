🍵Dalgona Matcha

“This one's for matcha lovers! 💚💚💚
Made with one of my favorite dairy- free milk, Bonsoy.
It is also naturally sweetened and low-carb.

Bonsoy is a truly healthy and nutritious drink.
Nature’s Glory Bonsoy is made from certified organic soybeans that are free from harmful pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and genetic modifications, all these can be commonly found in non-organic soybean beverages. 
Bonsoy is lactose-free, people who are allergic to milk can enjoy Bonsoy, a non-dairy product.
💚
Recipe: 
1 egg white
1/2 tsp matcha powder 
1 Tbsp monkfruit or sugar of your choice.
Ice
Bonsoy Milk
. 
Instructions:
1. Add the egg whites to a bowl, Whip the eggs on high until they start to turn frothy.

2. Once the egg white starts getting frothy after 1-2 minutes, add sweetener.

3. Continuously whip the egg white at a high-speed setting until thick, fluffy, and stiff peaks form (about 2-3 minutes)

4. Add the matcha powder and whisk a few more times until mixed in

5. Add ice to a glass and pour in milk, Spoon whipped matcha on top of the milk.
Feel free to sprinkle on some matcha powder.
