Nutrition – per bun:
Calories: 59
Carbohydrates: 2.8 grams
Protein: 4.8 grams
Fat: 1.5 grams

Ingredients – Makes 8:
1 whole broccoli incl the stick
1 egg
2 eggwhites
2 tablespoons Psyllium HUSK
1 ½ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
4 tablespoons coconut flour
Topping (optional): I like to use chia seeds or sesame 
Cooking instructions:
Turn on the oven at 200 degress and cover a baking plate with baking paper. Put the whole broccoli in a food processor and continue till looks like broccoli `rice`. Add the egg and egg whites and stir well. Finally add the Psyllium HUSK, coconut flour, baking powder and salt. Knead well and let the dough rest for 15 minuts. Make 8 buns and add to the baking plate, add the topping if wanted and let them bake for 15-20 minuts (till they´re golden on the top). Then can easily stay good in the fridge for a couple of days in a closed bag.

Please note the texture of the buns are soft, therefor I personally prefer myself to eats them toasted 😊
