Exploring new Take Away Deals during this Circuit Breaker/Semi-Lockdown period.

Crown Coffee: Roasted Pork Belly $15  before Takeaway discount.
Qiite a surprise to find this on a Cafe's menu. Newly launched item.
The color & texture looks spot on. As we cut through the meat, it was easy peasy. Tender & retain a level of moist from within. The con of this piece of meat is the skin or crust that's too tough for me to cut through(using a kitchen knife, not the plastic one given). The other con was the Mustard which was too salty for us. Luckily our following dish has curry chicken so we used that as the dipping sauce instead. But all was not lost as the Meat was excellent, best eaten on the day itself. Prefer not to heat it up as that would toughen the meat up(personal experience from my kitchen days). I found this Cafe around more than a year ago while visiting my client's office at the vicinity. Quite close to Bendemeer MRT or Lavender MRT.

DAILY GRIND By SPINELLI: Spaghetti Meatball Set $9.80 & Curry Chicken w/ baguette $8.80.
The plastic container used did it's job quite well as the food was still warm when we reached home. 
The Meatball was not hard at all, quite juicy when we bite through. The sauce  wasn't too wet & was lumpy lumpy & i kinda like that in a meatball spaghetti.
The Curry Chicken was ok as well. Although it wasn't spicy but it kinda reminds me of the curry found at Prata stall. 
The Coffee that i've not had in decades, anybody still remembers Spinelli Coffee during it's Hey days? 
Overall very good for value. üìçAperia Mall.

I personally like the Coffee Cup design so i kept it after finishing it. The plastic containers are washed up & will be retained for future use. Remember to Reduce, Reuse & Recycle as we all go for our Take Outs.
