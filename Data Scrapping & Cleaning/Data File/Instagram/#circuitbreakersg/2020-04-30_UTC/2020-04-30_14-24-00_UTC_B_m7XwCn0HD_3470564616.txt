As many have been asking, we feel the need to clarify. We are currently still operating. However delivery fulfilment of goods will be after 2 June 2020 or any new date updated by the authorities. We will keep you updated.

Thanks all who have newly placed your orders this week despite the above and willing to wait. Appreciate your kind patience during this time. Also thanks to those who supported us during the #circuitbreaker and throughout the years, be it through purchase or moral support. ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
