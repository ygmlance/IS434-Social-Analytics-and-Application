Heading into the Virtual World of Fitness.
-
YES! I will be teaching LIVE workout sessions twice a week. Starting in May 2020!
• Thursday 6:30pm-7:15pm Yoga HIIT
• Saturday 11am-11:45am Cardio Core HIIT

First session is on next Thursday 7th May at 6:30pm! Click link on my bio for more information and booking.

The benefits of attending a LIVE workout session are:
✅ You get coached by me and you will be motivated by me to get through the challenges you are facing during each session.
Remember - Challenge Brings Change! 💪
✅ Exercise options will be offered by me. Feel free to do the option that best suits you. No shame in the game. 🤟
✅ You could be doing the session alone in the comfort of your home but you are not alone. You are surrounded with like-minded people who are in the session with you, from start to finish. 🙌
✅ There is no excuse to miss your workout. You only need to put aside 45 minutes and I promise you! You will feel so awesome at the finish line. And be proud of your achievement! 👏

Do not hesitate! It is so much more important now, amidst this Covid 19 pandemic to stay healthy and stay active. See you online in my sessions! 😊
