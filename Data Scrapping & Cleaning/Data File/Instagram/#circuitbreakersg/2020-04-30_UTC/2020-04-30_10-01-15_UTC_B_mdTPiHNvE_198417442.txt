💖Your Fitness Level May Determine How Much You Sweat.💖
Did a 20 min post workout HIIT this morning. 
I sweat so much that even with a mat also no use. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Still as slippery as when I do on the floor. My elbows kept sliding. 😭

But it’s a good sign when you sweat more and sooner. It means you are getting fitter. Sweat is our body’s way of reducing our core temperature which heats up during exercise. If you are fit, you are able to work harder and generate more power which also means you generate more heat. Hence, you end up sweating faster and more! 💦
✅Inch worm pushup - 15 reps

Repeat for 4 sets. Did an extra set for this video. 😅
