Omelette on tomatoes • a skill to master
.
I’m starting to master the omelette skill; the inside is a scrambled moist consistency. Way to go!
.
Notes: Use a pair of chopsticks to scramble instead. Stop when you feel like “If you scramble further, you’ll see the base of the pan”, and fold it into the omelette shape. Flip it slightly so it lands on the wet side and cook a few seconds more to “seal” it. Dish out and serve!
