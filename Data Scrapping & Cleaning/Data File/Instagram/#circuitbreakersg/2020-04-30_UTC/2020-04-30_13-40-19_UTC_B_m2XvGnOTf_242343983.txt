Gorgeous award-winning #BBSunkissed color to brighten up this rainy day! Golden blonde hand-painted balayage starts just above the ears, away from the roots, making this look more wearable for a longer time. As compared to highlights that starts from the roots and require a full roots touch up every 6 weeks, a balayage requires a toner every 6 weeks instead and can wait another 4-6 weeks before a full touch up is required. 
Our color toner is a ammonia-free, gives hair great luminosity and deposits color without drying out the hair.
