Pirate Life Brewing's Port Local Lager 🇦🇺🍺
⁣
I'm more familiar with Pirate Life's hoppier offerings, so I was curious to see what this Australian craft brewer would make of a lager.
⁣
I tasted the "herbaceous, earthy and spicy flavours from the Spalt and Perle hops" first on each pull, which yielded to the mellow "sweetness of the Vienna and Pilsner malt" towards the swallow, ending in a dry finish. This is definitely hoppier than your usual lager, but in a good way that doesn't detract from the style. ⁣
⁣
Created as the house lager for the venerable Port Admiral Hotel in Port Adelaide, I'm sure the Port Local Lager will keep the establishment's taps flowing with its thirst quenching goodness. Yet another solid craft brew from Down Under!
