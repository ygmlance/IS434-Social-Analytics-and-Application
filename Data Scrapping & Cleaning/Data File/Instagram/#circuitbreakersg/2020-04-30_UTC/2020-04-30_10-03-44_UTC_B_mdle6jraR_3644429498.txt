Day 24 of Circuit Breaker.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
In this circuit breaker period, everyone would want to cut down on spending too much. Here is a $3 wanton noodles that you might want to try.🍜（云吞面）⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Yes, you heard me right! Only $3 with generous amount of char siew and handmade wanton from @HockKeeWantonNoodle! Their handmade dumplings soup is also at $3 for half a dozen too! 🥟 ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
The portion is big and with generous amount of pork lard! 🤩 The springy noodles goes so well with their home made chili sauce.  The noodles was still very good even though it was a takeaway. The food travelled well! ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
They have kway teow version too. And if you love chicken feet (风抓）, don’t forget to order their deliciously braised chicken feet! 😋 ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
All the ingredients are hand made by the boss, Mr Ong. ⁣⁣ @HockKeeWantonNoodle has been serving wanton noodle since 1965.⁣⁣⁣
