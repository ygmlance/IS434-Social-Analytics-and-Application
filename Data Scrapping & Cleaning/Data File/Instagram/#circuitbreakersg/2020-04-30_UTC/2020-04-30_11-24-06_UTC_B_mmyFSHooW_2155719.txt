Steak 🥩 and Spaghetti 🍝 is our dinner.
I had a new discovery that I can sous vide the beef in my rice cooker!I’m so excited when I discovered it. So I put two types of beef into a ziploc bag n threw it into my rice cooker, set temp set time and thenafter I panfried it on my grill about 1 min on each side and succulent beef is ready. 
Carbo is aglio olio spaghetti with lots of garlic, chili flakes, parsley and Parmesan Cheese. 
Great meal!
