How to enjoy pizza + Mao Shan Wang durian + bubble tea at the same time 😋 - thanks to the collaboration between GrabFood, LiHo, Gong Cha and selected F&B partners... helps that 2 of them are located at the nearby neighbourhood mall!
.
I don’t usually get bubble tea 🛁🍹cravings, but I must have seen too many pictures of BBT recently... haha!
.
Monkey see, monkey do... 🐵🙈🙉🙊🐒 copied my neighbour’s placement of stool outside the house for contactless deliveries. 😉
.
Verdict: Wonderful and personable service from @grabfoodsg’s delivery guy, @lihosg brown sugar milk tea with white pearls was good (very popular as certain drinks were sold out within minutes once the restaurant opened) and pizzas were pretty good too from @tinospizzacafesg (just that the MSW durian pizza from the RWS outlet tastes better as it is less salty with more generous durian topping - still a great improvement from when Tino’s just opened at Tiong Bahru Plaza! 😊) .
With cravings satisfied, I had a happy lunch and yea, great to take a break from cooking! .
