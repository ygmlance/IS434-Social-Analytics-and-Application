One brew at a time...morning & afternoon filter brews...loving my new coffee beans from @homeground.coffee & @doubleup.coffee for home brewing during CB WFH. Ending April & welcoming month of May with these lovely Mokka processed & natural processed Colombia coffee beans with awesome tasting notes. Thank God tomorrow is Labour Day public holiday! Yay! 👍☕️🌈❤️🌈🙏#brewathome #circuitbreakersg #wfh #homebrewing #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #homecafe #momocoffeediary #onebrewatatime #filtercoffee #specialtycoffee #hgcrs #homegroundcoffeeroasters #comfortinacup #sanityinacup #doubleupcoffee #youmakemesmile #2020fighting #shiftingperspectives #reframe #gratitude #strengthbuilding #resiliencebuilding #staysane #staysafe #givethanksinallcircumstances #countmyblessings #takejoyinthelittlethings #drinkgoodcoffee #keepcalmandcarryon ☕️🌈
