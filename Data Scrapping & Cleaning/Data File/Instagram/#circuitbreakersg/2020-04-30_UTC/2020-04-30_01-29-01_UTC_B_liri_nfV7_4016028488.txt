Did you know that our Ankole tumblers make beautiful table centerpieces? They take up little space and the natural grains with brass, create such a beautiful aesthetic. You can place real flowers but you get some nice artificial flowers too which are less maintenance. As we are all at home now during the Lockdown it is difficult to get hold of fresh flowers all the time. Super functional makes these a hot seller. We sometimes moves it to the guest bathroom as a little arrangement too. The creativity is yours!

Limited stock. Artisan made in Kenya.
