When it seems impossible to balance kids, work and housework (not to mention the poor neglected spouse), mummy takes some time off to balance some rainbows instead! These beautiful colours brighten the most dreary of days, especially when going out is not an option. Some parents struggle with getting their kids off screens and playing - the best is to enjoy the toys because #monkeyseemonkeydo so #stayhomestayfun guys!
