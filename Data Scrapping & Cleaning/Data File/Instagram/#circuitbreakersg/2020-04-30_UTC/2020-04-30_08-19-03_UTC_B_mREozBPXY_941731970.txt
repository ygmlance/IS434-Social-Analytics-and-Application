Thank you for having both of your time @davidlowmd & @eexuanng for the lovely live chat!
"Sharing of updates on lockdown in Singapore (Circuit Breaker) and Malaysia (Movement Control Order) with @eexuanng last night!
It's amazing how SG has done it with optimism and cooperation from the people. Thanks, @eexuanng for the eye-opening session!

Singapore's cases in the community now down to a single-digit and 2 digits in Malaysia. Both sides are starting to ease the restrictions. Praying hard for flattening of the curve and economic recovery in the shortest time possible.🙏🙏
Also quite amused to receive lots of questions regarding the double eyelid procedure @meclinicmalaysia in the midst of a pandemic.😅"
