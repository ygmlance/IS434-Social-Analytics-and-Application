【Snow Fungus Pork Ribs Soup】⁣⁣
⁣⁣
We love to drink a bowl of Chinese herbal soup twice per month, no more and no less. We used to boil herbal soup for hours. With the help of Ninja Foodi OP300, just need 30 minutes for a decent pot of herbal soup! ⁣⁣

Here’s the herbal soup that I usually boil - Snow Fungus pork ribs soup to help remove heatiness. ⁣⁣
