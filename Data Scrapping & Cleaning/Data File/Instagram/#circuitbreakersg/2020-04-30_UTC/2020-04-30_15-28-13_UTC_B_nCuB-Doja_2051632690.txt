Dear #pawfriends I have a little problem 🐶 
I want to join the #stayhomepetchallenge that @spcasingapore started but I don’t have any “interesting” photos or videos of mama and I to share, because mama cannot #workfromhome so life has been pretty much the “same” for us 😅 What’s different though is that we have come to cherish more of the little things we have in life, like this squishy cuddle I’m sharing with mama ❤️ — ok actually I’m hiding from the thunder and rain LOL 🙊 
For all you lucky ones with your humans at home 24/7 now, I hope you’re having a blast 🐾🐾
But if you’re like me, hey don’t be sad, we fluffballs play a very important part in keeping our humans sane so cheer up! 😘😘😘
Stay safe everypawdy! 🙏🏼
