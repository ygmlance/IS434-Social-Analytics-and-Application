#circuitbreakersg day 24

chanced upon @kopifellas right before the new measures for circuit breaker was announced. Fred not, there is hope. We can still get to enjoy bubble tea ðŸ˜­ whatâ€™s even better is you can order food too. Have been ordering kopifellas so many times ever since. 
Tried their Sliced abalone noodles, Laksa, Lor Mee and Kaya toast. All not bad and at very affordable price. Their noodles range $4-5+, toast $2 and up, toast sets $4.8-6 and they have wide variety of drinks. Kopi (coffee) to non caffeine and tea beverages. Honey pearls topping available too. 
Some recommendations:
Thai Green Milk tea, Honey Lemon Earl Grey tea, Honey Oolong milk tea, Honey Earl grey milk tea and Honey green tea! 
You can order directly through their website or whatsapp them (check their ig bio). Available on grab and deliveroo as well!
