🏖TASTE SAFE SAND PLAY🏝We are counting down the days till we can have our sand playdate with our friends again without worrying about the virus but till that day comes we got to make do with what we already have at home.🏡
.
Don’t worry we didn’t sneak some sand back home before the #circuitbreakersg, this is something you can do at home that will only take you less than 5 minutes to prepare! Most commonly known as moon sand or cloud dough because of the texture this is a superb alternative if you are missing some sand and you do not have those kinetic sand at home! A little messy but what is Sensory Play if there isn’t any mess right?💣
.
Swipe left for the ingredients needed but here is how you make them. 1️⃣Take 2 cups of plain flour and mix them up with about 1 cup of oil. It should be just nice for you to be able to clump them altogether. 2️⃣This is totally optional (but since we wanted to do a construction like theme), take 1 cup of cocoa powder and mix well. And DONE! Super easy right?
.
⚠️Notice I indicated vegetable oil or coconut oil. These are oils that is gentle to our kids skin and taste safe in case they ingest it.
.
Put them in a tub, add on any other items in, take them to the corridor and have a mini sand play party while social distancing!😎 And once you’re done, keep them in a ziploc bag or an airtight tupperware and have a go at it another day! This can last for a very long time if stored well.🔐
