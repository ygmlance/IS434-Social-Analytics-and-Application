A month ago when our local circuit breaker lockdown kicked in, I found myself suffering (like many others did) for not having my usual gym routine. I also started working nights at a new job. I lost sleep and appetite. I'd reduced my strength training from 5 days a week to barely 1 or 2. Despite losing muscle mass and strength, I was still able to run - so I jumped right back into endurance style training to maintain some form of fitness. 
Today, I broke my previous personal best of 7min/km for a 5km run.

The human body is capable of much, more more than we believe, and many of the limitations we have are the ones we set for ourselves. Stay strong and stay safe, everyone. We will all get through this üí™ ‚ù§
