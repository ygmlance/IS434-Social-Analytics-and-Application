I woke up to the nice aroma of one of my fav Burmese dishes. The soup consists of lemongrass, turmeric, lots of shallots and fish in broth. The smell of lemongrass filled the whole house and instantly I knew, my helper was making Mohinga today. 
In Myanmar, Mohinga is considered as a national dish and widely eaten. It is a lemongrass-infused fish soup with bee hoon, like laksa, usually eaten as breakfast in the country. This dish is so popular that it is widely available in the country, usually sold as hawker food by the road or in a shop. I tried this dish for myself when I visited Yangon a few years ago, liked it instantly.

1 important ingredient is missing from our Mohinga dish today though, which is the crashed fritters to garnish on top of the dish. It is a lentil fritter fried using split pea. Adding the crashed fritters into Mohinga gives so much texture and taste to it. Since we are out, we do without it today. 
Mohinga, a must-try dish in Myanmar and should you visit there one day, don't forget to give it a try. No trip to Myanmar is complete without eating Mohinga.
