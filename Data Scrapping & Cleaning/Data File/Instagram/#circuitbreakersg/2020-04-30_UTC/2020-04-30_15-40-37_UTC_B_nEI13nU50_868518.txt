Day 23 of Circuit Breaker period. 
It's a public holiday tomorrow but every day feels pretty much the same now. So something different tonight for a change: Kakuni Donburi.
The way Japanese utilize their rice cookers is amazing. Not the first time attempting this rice cooker recipe (oops, the first time was in August last year😅) but still impressed that the results was comparable to stovetop simmering. 
Included eggs today and was I glad I took the extra trouble to do so. Itadakimasu!
