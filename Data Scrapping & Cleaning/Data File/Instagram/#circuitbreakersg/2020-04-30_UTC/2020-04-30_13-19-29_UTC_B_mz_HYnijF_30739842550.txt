How many people are trying their best to ration their Jamón stash till the end of the circuit breaker? 🙋🏻‍♂️ We’re running low ourselves - but this long weekend counts as a celebration to break open a new pack!

Anyway, pre-orders for Jamón are still open till we run out. DM us to reserve if you want it in time to celebrate the end of the circuit breaker!

As usual, one 100g packet for $38, 3 for $108.
