This is my tiny “forest” of Thai basil. All of it was propagated from a single cutting at the beginning of #circuitbreakersg.

You can grow Thai basil from seeds in soil or hydroponics and you can grow them from cuttings too. So far, I’ve found that if you just stick the cutting into the soil with most of the leaves removed, it will thrive and root fairly easily.

I’m planning to harvest them for basil pork and pesto. Do you have any good Thai basil recipes?
