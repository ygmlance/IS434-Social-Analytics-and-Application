✨NEW✨ Emeralds are notoriously difficult to capture on film, that’s because the chromium in emeralds responds to the chromium or emulsion in the film, even top photographers are having the problem shooting an emerald.

Video of this 1ct emerald pendant was taken under different lighting so that you get to see how vibrant and rich its color is even under different lighting, one of the cleanest pieces, top clarity plus an artistic  setting with baguette diamonds, very modern and sophisticated, PM☺️💍🎶🍵💚
