One of the items in #theselfcaresolution book is to drink enough water. It was the first thing I tried to add to my habits because 
1. Entry level was low. 
2. I definitely needed to drink more water.

I initially went with number of cups of water. But given the hectic schedules, I tended to forget how many cups I had drunk. So I decided to get a large water bottle and aimed to finish at least that bottle in the day.

The water bottle also means that I can take the bottle along with me when I need to go out.

Each day, I start the day by filling the bottle while I wait for my water to heat up to make my coffee. And each time I see the bottle, I try to drink as much as I can from it. This is to avoid drinking too much near bedtime.

So far, in the last month or so, I’ve finished at least a bottle a day, not including liquids taken like coffee or soup.

I’ve found a general improvement in terms of skin and saliva production. It is something I’ve also started with the kids.

Do you drink enough water?
