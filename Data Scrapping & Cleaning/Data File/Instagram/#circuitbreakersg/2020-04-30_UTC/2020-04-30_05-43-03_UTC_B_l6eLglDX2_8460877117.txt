Workout anywhere with these tricep dips. Here we recommend externally rotating your shoulders (pointing the fingers outwards) especially for those with unstable shoulders/shoulder injuries. This helps create more stability and helps keep your shoulder joints healthy! Remember to keep your chest out and donâ€™t let your shoulders pop forwards.
