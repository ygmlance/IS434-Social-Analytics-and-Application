☆MEISTER COURSE - Flower Of Crystal Art☆
Finally got to meet Beatrice in our virtual classroom for our late night shenanigans 🤣

The session was supposed to take place during the week when #circuitbreakersg was announced. Plans had to change but it was a great thing that Bea purchased the Starter Kit and with the introduction Zoom session that comes with the Starter Kit, she was ready to rock and roll.

Blooming from the mini art, an overview of the techniques employed in both Yuuka 優花 and Ayaka 彩花 artworks were introduced. As we move on to bloom our glowing Yuuka, Bea made a bold move to try colours we hardly reach for and I think we are really pleased with the end results!

Tips and tricks on stencils creation, artwork composition and blending techniques were taught in my Meister Course. More importantly, sharing my past mistakes, why they were made and how to avoid them in future were messages I really want to convey to my participants. Beatrice is extremely fast to catch on, making my job unbelievably easy 🤣

See you next week for our Ayaka rendezvous, Bea!
