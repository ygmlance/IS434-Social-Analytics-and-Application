Circuit Breaker Takeaway - Spicy Grill Fish? .
Before the circuit breaker, I have been trying best to eat what I imagine I would not be able to have during the CB.
.
Grill fish is one of that, however, I probably underestimate restaurants in Singapore.
.
When I was waiting for my takeaway one day, I see a shop selling one-man portion grill fish, at just SGD9.9!
.
So the other day, I went to pack one mine (it is half fish for one man). The flavor I went for is the classic spicy one! (BTW, the shop total offers 9 flavors, that's quite a lot!)
.
Luckily, the fish is still warm when I brought it home. It tastes quite good, and more importantly, spicy!
.
Since moving to Singapore, haven't had a lot of whole fishes. So grill fish is a good dish to me, especially I can have a portion for one at an affordable price! (Probably cheaper than ordering fish in #ËèúÈ£Ø)
.
You have to be very careful having grill fish at home. The dish is extremely oily so any drop going to the floor / table can be a headache...... so it's better to eat at restaurant, but need wait until the CB is over. Meanwhile, can still have a take away! .
