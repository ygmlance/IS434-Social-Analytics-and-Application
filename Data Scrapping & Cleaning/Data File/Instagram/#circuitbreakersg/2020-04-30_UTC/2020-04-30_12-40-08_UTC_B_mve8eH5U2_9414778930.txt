It‚Äôs been a week since I started this fundraiser and pledged 100% of the sale of this Mother‚Äôs Day digital print to @itsrainingraincoats to support the plight of the foreign workers in Singapore affected by Covid19.
.
And I have to say a HUGE THANK YOU to everyone who has come out to support this! Your purchases means a lot to me and even more to the foreign workers who will be receiving this.
.
This fundraiser is still ONGOING guys..all the way till Mother‚Äôs Day (10th May) so you can get mum a little something extra to brighten her day while at the same time knowing that you have helped someone in need.
.
Here is a #timelapse of the watercolor piece which I digitized into the Mother‚Äôs Day print ..‚û°Ô∏è swipe to see.
.
This digital Mother‚Äôs Day print is going for just sgd5 where you can download it! Print it! Frame it! Gift it!
.
And bless someone today.
