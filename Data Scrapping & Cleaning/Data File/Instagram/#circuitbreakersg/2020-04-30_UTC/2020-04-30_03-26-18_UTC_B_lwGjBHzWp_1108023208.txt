I have many of these washcloths lying around the house - they are extremely handy for wiping spills or kitchen counters (I like the thicker ones for better absorbency), or wiping surfaces (just used the thinner more flexible one for cleaning the vents on the standing fan). I feel better knowing that they are made of natural materials and not coated in bleaching chemicals or leeching micro-plastics everytime I wash them. Here’s to little things that make our lives more beautiful 🌸🌼🌈❄️
