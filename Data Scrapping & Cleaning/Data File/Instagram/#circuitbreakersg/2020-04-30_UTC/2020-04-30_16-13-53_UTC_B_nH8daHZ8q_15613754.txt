Had a better grip with the dough this time with the wrapping and balling.  Used ready mixed ground peanuts which look and taste a bit rough. Preferred the sesame version! Managed to replicate the soup (ginger, sugar and pandan) and it taste almost the same as what I usually get from the Chinese dessert store. It feels good to be self sufficient especially when we are living in the strange times of social distancing. #circuitbreakersg day
