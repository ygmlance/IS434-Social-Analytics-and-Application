.‚†Ä‚†Ä
The simple things in life are truly priceless and give us true happiness don't you agree? Amidst this circuit breaker, we have seen many heartwarming stories and how many Singaporeans are stepping up and donating or even volunteering during this situation.
.
One incident that caught our attention was how this Mcdonald Granny who couldn't work due to circuit breaker and the following actions of her showcase how we can all be contented and show gratitude to those people that care for us.
.
This kind-hearted McDonald's granny was one of the staff members who have to stay home. But her stay home was made a little sweeter as a kind-hearted Samaritan has been making regular visits delivering groceries to her after she has stopped receiving free meals.
.
This McDonald's granny lives with her deaf and mute sister, however, the place where she gets her free weekday meal has stopped due to circuit breaker, and hence Ms Ling has been going over to her house to give her groceries every week. As the old granny works in McDonald's, she gets a free packet of Ribena so often so after every single visit, Ms Ling will leave the house full of Ribena from the granny.
.
On 29th April, McDonald's granny didn't have enough Ribena to give her so she decided to give her a $20 Casio watch which was a gift from McDonald's to her when she hit her 5th year of working with them.
