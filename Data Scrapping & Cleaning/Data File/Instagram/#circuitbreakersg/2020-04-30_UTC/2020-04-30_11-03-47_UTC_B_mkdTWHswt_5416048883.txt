Activity Thursday : 🎨🏃🍳
———————————————
#1: It’s time to welcome May 2020. We don't know about you, but with #circuitbreakersg extended, the restriction measures in place to keep us safe may be challenging for some. So, we decided that making a mood tracker (May)be (geddit? :D) helpful! 
It’ll help you track down your mood patterns during this uncertain time. So get some pretty paper, or perhaps your 2020 diary and start doing up your own mood tracker however you want it to look like. Tricia has made one for herself using paper, while the team has also designed a printable mood tracker that you can use for a start! 
Head over to our FB page (Link in bio) to download it!

#2: Kick up that daily chore a notch and workout while cleaning! We bring to you Joey's anyhow-clean-and-workout session! 
DISCLAIMER: We are not professionals, do at your own risk! 
Parents: Challenge your children to do it - they are kept occupied and you get a slightly cleaner house
Spouse: Buddy workouts ain't it? Do it together and have the house cleaned in half the time! 
Youngster: Do it, record it and tag your friends to do it too! 
Elders: You have the most important role - make sure all them above #staysafe

#3: With McDonald's now closed indefinitely, Wei Ern needed an alternative🍗Not quite McSpicy but it'll be crispy, juicy & spicy🌶️Shallow frying uses less oil & the double fry ensures a crunch! If you've bought tapioca starch to make bbt pearls, this batter also utilises it (: Don't forget to share with us your masterpiece! #friedchicken
