Who says I canâ€™t cook? You obviously havenâ€™t tasted my bowl of instant noodle! Honestly speaking, itâ€™s been hard for someone like me who is not into cooking to stay home during this Circuit Breaker period... and Iâ€™m feeling hungry on a rainy night. So I decided to cook my favourite spicy flavor of Shin Ramyun! Premium noodles and it gives me a chewy texture which I like. I added these CP Jumbo Wonton, two eggs & some left over kimchi in the fridge to complete my simple & yet delightful instant noodle meal. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ #instafood #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgfoodlover #instagramsg #food #igfoodies #foodgasm #foodiesg #foodie #sgfoodie #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodlovers #igfood #flatlay #instantnoodles #rainyday #cookmyself #nongshim #nongshimnoodles #cpfoodssg #cpjumbowanton #stayhomewithascott #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakercookingchallenge #stayhomeforsg #sgunited
