Are you a believer of hearty breakfasts?

We are! Because we are morning people (we wake as early as 5am for exercise) 🧘🏻‍♀️so breakfast is really our fuel to start the day.

Since the start of circuit breaker, we’ve been having many types of bread, toasts, sandwiches.. this morning, I tried and made the Korean street sandwich which never fails to make me drool wherever I watched someone making it.. The son loved it and placed orders for more in the future. If you want to make a kid eat more veges, make this. 💚
