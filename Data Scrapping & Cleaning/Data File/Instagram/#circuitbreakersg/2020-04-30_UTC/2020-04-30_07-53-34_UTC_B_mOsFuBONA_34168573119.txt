Iâ€™m working, but would rather be reading. Thank goodness itâ€™s a holiday weekend.

I just finished #ananonymousgirl There were many things I liked about it, but I found it a bit light on the suspense, which is why itâ€™s a ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ for me.

I loved the New York City December setting, and the book is well written with a lot of energy. The things I didnâ€™t like were that I found the subject matter a little less thrilling and more like something youâ€™d find in a drama, which gave the novel a slightly strange edge. Dr. Shields is a very peculiar character. Itâ€™s also difficult not to compare a book to the last one I read by the authors, and so I canâ€™t help but feel I may have enjoyed it more if I hadnâ€™t read #thewifebetweenus first.
