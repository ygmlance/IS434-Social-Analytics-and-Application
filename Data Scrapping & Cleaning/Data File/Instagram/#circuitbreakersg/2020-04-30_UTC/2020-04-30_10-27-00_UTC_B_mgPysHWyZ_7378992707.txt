Bird's eye view of yet another water feature that we installed because we can't get enough of them! We used artificial water lilies instead of real ones ðŸ™ˆ Could you guys tell?

Artificial plants are ideal for water features like these because they're aesthetically pleasant and no maintenance is required. No algae = no worries!
