Circuit breaker day 23/24: Documenting what Iâ€™ve been cooking this CB because honestly, Iâ€˜ve never cooked so much in my life! ðŸ˜†Thankfully I still managed to put together some decent simple fare -  1. Fusion aglio olio with Hokkaido scallops, mussels and luncheon meat 
2. Japanese curry served on Japanese rice. #jmcooks #stayhomehacks #circuitbreakersg
