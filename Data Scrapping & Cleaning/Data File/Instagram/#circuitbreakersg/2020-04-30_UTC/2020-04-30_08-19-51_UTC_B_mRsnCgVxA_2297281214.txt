Leftover flat bread with garlic butter makes a yummy ham, cheddar cheese and tomato sambo with dip on the side for me... Steamed up some glutinous rice and threw in some cherry tomatoes for the Chinese boy, @iamivanlau... And a mug of warm barley water to combat the good ol' Chinese heatiness on "circuit breaker" day 24... üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
