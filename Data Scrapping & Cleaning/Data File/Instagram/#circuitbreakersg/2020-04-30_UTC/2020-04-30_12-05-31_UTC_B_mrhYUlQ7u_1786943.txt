Usually when it's strawberry season in Korea, you'll probably see alot of cafes launching strawberry themed drinks with the strawberry milk being the most commonly seen one. ⁣

I really like the combination of matcha and strawberry as well, it kind of works + the colour combi is so pretty! ⁣
⁣
For the strawberry compote, I basically diced strawberries, added in sugar and lemon juice and left it overnight. ⁣

Also, cheers to the long weekend!
