🍦 ICE CREAM🍦 
Hello everyone 👋 
How’s everyone doing? Hope all are well on your side and everyone is still sane and happy 🤣
.

Lets explore letter Ii with our ice cream 🍦#kidscraft. Using cardboard as the base of our ice cream🍦, pompoms, cotton balls and bottle caps as the flavour and toppings. ⚠️ Adult supervision is a must since small parts can be hazardous. 
HuHa were excited to create their own ice cream🍦 but the glue became their muse the moment they saw it! 🤣 
All in all they had fun exploring different textures, great #sensoryplay, letter recognition and squeezing lots of glue for the ice cream🍦 
Take care and stay safe guys 💕
