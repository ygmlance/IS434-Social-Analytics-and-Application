Went out at 1.30pm for my reduced-hours-afternoon-bike ride today because I knew a storm was forecast for late afternoon. Cycled up the park connector to Bedok reservoir, around it, and home - it was a good and strenuous ride. Stopped off at the petrol station by my place to buy beer just as epic storm hit at 3.30pm - got soaked in the few hundred metres back home - but straight in a hot shower before a cold beer! Really feeling it in the legs today. Day 24 of #circuitbreakersg #ilovemybike #bedokreservoir #tropicalweather
