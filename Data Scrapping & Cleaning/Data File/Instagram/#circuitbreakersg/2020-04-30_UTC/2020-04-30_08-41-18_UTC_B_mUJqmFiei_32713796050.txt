We can have confidence that Godâ€™s word provides everything we need to keep us going until Jesus calls us home. Godâ€™s word is powerful enough to provide for us now and powerful enough to raise the dead. This offer is open to anyone, even you, whoever you are! Why not chat to a Christian friend and ask them to tell you more. Or join us for our online Sunday services, available on our website from Saturday to Monday. ðŸ¤—Link in bio!
