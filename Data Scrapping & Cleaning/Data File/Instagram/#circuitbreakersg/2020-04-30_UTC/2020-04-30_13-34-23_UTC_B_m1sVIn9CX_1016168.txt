#Circuitbreakersg day 24

One very rainy Thursday that makes staying at home very shiok. 
This calls for some home-made banana cake that looked great but doesnâ€™t taste so good ðŸ˜… 
Try again soon when I have overripe bananas. 
Dinner was : ðŸ”ºChicken curry with rice, cabbage and fried egg Ala scissor rice style. ~
