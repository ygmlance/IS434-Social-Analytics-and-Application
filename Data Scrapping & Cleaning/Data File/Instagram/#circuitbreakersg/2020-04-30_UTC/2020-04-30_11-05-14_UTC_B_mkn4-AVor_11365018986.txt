Tadddahhhh!~ I hope everyone is keeping well and safe during this period of Circuit Breaker. As much as I get more time for my family and myself, it has also been a learning opportunity for me to do things that are completely out of space- like video editing, going "live" on a scary social media platform (you have no idea how this is scarier than speaking to a crowd of 80 people) and of course, speaking to a computer that doesn't respond back.

Thank you for staying connected. Here's a short video of theraband exercises you can do at home (even my mom recognizes some reformer exercises..??). #stayhome #staysafe #stayfit #stayhealthy #staypositive #stayconnected

Also, my friends and I are teaming up to offer the public a variety of group classes over the week, starting May!
