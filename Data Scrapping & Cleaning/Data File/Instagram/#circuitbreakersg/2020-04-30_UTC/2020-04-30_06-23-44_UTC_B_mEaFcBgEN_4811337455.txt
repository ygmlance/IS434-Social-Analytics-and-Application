Love this! Each of us are holding multiple hats, prolly more than we ever had! While we have to focus on our children, the household and work, do take a breather. Recognize your own needs and get some self-care. My favorite self-care is baking, listening to podcast, and to be honest, just lazing in bed for that 15 minutes (or did it became an hour? ðŸ¤”). ðŸ˜‹ What's yours?
