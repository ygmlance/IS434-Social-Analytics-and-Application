My heart is full, my stomach even fuller. Year 2020: all non-essential services are closed and there’s limited choices of what one can do. I’m truly blessed and undeserving of your loves. Thank you for your well wishes and thoughts. Everyone pls stay safe. I got xiao touched and very very paiseh. #circuitbreakersg #thankyouteamforthewebconferenceandsong
