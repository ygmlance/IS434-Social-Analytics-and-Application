As a family business founded in 1893, BERNINA has weathered a world economic crisis and two world wars. The current crisis, however, presents us with special challenges. Many of our partners around the world are made of independently owned businesses. In many countries these businesses have been officially closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As hard as the crisis has hit our company and partners, there are people who are in a situation that is a lot worse and who can barely make ends meet. Over the last few weeks, sewists around the world have stepped-up to show support and to create essential items to be donated. The sewing community cares. Our employees care. We care! 
BERNINA Singapore strongly supports The Invictus Fundâ€™s initiative to deliver critical services to the vulnerable during COVID-19.

Please click (link in bio) to donate to The Invictus Fund (donation starts from $10). Because you care, you give them courage and hope to embrace each day.
