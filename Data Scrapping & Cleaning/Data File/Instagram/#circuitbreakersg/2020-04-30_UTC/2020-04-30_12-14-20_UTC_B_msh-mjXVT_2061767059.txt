Day 24 Circuit Breaker Meal: Woke up late today, so have brunch, tea and dinner. Learning to cook hot plate tofu from #ieatishootipost. Presentation not quite there yet but quite tasty. Afternoon thunderstorm caused the main switch in my circuit breaker box to trip reminding me that I am only in the middle of the Circuit Breaker, only 24 days. #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
