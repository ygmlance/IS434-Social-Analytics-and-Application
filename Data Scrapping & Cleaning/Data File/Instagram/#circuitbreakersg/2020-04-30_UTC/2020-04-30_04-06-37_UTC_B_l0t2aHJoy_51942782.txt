During this #circuitbreakersg, where resources are limited. I could only came out with Stay-at-Home crafts /educational activities with the supplies I have at home. 
With the recycled materials (cardboards) and the supplies i have at home. I came out with pretend play nail salon to keep her engaged. 
Girls just LOVE 💕 nail painting. This activity allow her to develop her fine motor skills, eye coordination and creativity. 
Beside just pretend play, it’s become an educational resources for her too learning her multiplication facts for the 5 Times Tables up to 10x5.

These hands-on activities can still pass as “home schooling’ efforts for her younger brother too! 👍🏻 win-win
