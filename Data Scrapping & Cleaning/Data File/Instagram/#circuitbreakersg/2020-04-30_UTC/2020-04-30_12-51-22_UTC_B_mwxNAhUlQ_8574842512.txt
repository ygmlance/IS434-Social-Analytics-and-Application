‚≠êÔ∏è NEW ITEM ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚Å£
‚Å£
We‚Äôre so excited to release our new item! Mostly because we love love love blocks play! Amidst our busy schedule, we can‚Äôt resist in planning another set of activity for the little ones! ‚Å£
‚Å£
Blocks play have been known to help in the development of language, cognitive, fine motor skills and problem solving skills. Not only that, it also helps in a child‚Äôs creativity, the concept of cause and effect and visual perception. You can also go on further with patterning concept ( etc: ABAB, AABB, ABBA), colour sorting and more through the building blocks activity. ‚Å£
‚Å£
For this set, we kept the pattern cards to the cute size of 9cm x 9cm, with the wooden cube blocks measuring 2.5cm x 2.5cm, making it an adorable fun size to bring around anywhere in the ziplock bags. It requires minimal supervision (depending on age group) and this is best played on a flat surface. üòÅ‚Å£
‚Å£
As an introductory we will be selling this set for only $16.50 for a limited period of time! ‚Å£
‚Å£
We are bringing in limited sets for this as a start so... fastest fingers first! üòç‚Å£
