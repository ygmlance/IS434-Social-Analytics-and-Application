Balanced Priorities (Faith First, Family Second & Career Third) is one of the core values in Mary Kay which I embrace and practise daily. 
Day 2 of Power 13,
A campaign to spread love and care before Mary Kay Ashâ€™s 102nd birthday on 12 May.
We are grateful to our founder for  passing her legacy to all women to lead an enriching life. 
Whatâ€™s one value you strongly believe in life? ðŸ’“
