No weights?! No problem!

Just use whatever you can at home!
- A dining chair or table
- As many heavy books you can find
- Detergent bottles (wine bottles if you want)
- Cabinet
- Your bed (?!)
- All the toilet paper you have hoarded ðŸ˜‚ (!!)

Thereâ€™s so many things you can use at home for weights! Sharing a few exercises I have thought up with the things I can find.

Most importantly is to use it safely and to have fun while youâ€™re working out. Break a sweat but not anything else!
