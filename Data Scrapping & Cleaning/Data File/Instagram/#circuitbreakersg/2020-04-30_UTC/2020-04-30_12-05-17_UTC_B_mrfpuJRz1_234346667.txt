【Recipe】Dinner for the family tonight. Back to cooking some of the old favourites and fridge clearing. #天天煮天天吃🐝 
Cooked butter garlic multigrain fried rice with spinach. Probably not as yummy as the original garlic butter fried rice🙈, this version is healthier IMO haha. 
Braised pork ribs with beancurd skin. #honeybeecooksbraisedporkribsbeancurd 
Also cooked Spicy pan fried gyoza / dumplings. Dumpling skins are store bought here but if you’re keen on making your own, you’re welcome to try out this recipe here #honeybeemakespumpkindumplingskins 
So instead of boiling the dumplings, I pan sear them till all crispy on the base. Then drizzle the spicy tangy sauce over dumplings. My family enjoyed this version more☺️👏🏻🥟 #crispydumplings
