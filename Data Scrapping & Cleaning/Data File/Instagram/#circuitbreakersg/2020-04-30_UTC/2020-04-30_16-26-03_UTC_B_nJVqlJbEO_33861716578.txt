Mango Pomelo Sago | 杨枝甘露｜

Kitchen Cheat | Handheld blender 
Seriously gais, this mini blender from taobao is amazing!

Prep Time: 30mins
1. Dice mangoes, freeze the not so pretty ones, keep those pretty ones for plating. 😛 prep this in advance so that it is cold enough! 
2. Blend the frozen mangoes with milk. You’ll get the mango purée. If your mangoes aren’t sweet, you can use condensed milk. 
3. Prep the sago. This is the tricky one. 
Heat a pot of water. When the water is boiling, pour in the sago. Cook through until it’s translucent (mine is semi cooked). Gotta stir it occasionally so it doesn’t stick to the pot. Rinse the cooked sago through a sieve and running water to remove the excess starch. 
4. Plate the mango purée, mango cubes, pomelo (we didn’t have pomelo, we swapped it with grapefruit) and sago. .
