DAY 24 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
MAC & CHEESE
CHICKEN WINGS
(Will post the wings recipe soon)

This post is for  my dearest friend Preeti.  @preetisawani ðŸ‘­
Sometimes we know people for years and years, but never really thank them or appreciate them enough. We should! 
So Preeti is very health concious now, but there was a time when we just ate and ate, and ate! Carbohydrate was just a word that existed on our science text book, not our lives. And she just loved Mac & Cheese. After a long phone call yesterday, I missed her so much, I decided to cook her fav dish today.

We met when we were about 10 years old, but became good friends in our teens. 'Best Friends'  does not sound enough to describe what we share. Over 30 years of love, gossip, disagreements, first champagne together, board exams, boyfriends, jam sessions, singing George Michael songs, dancing with good looking YO's and then chatting about it all night, baking cakes,  me teaching her Hindi, she teaching me Math, wearing similar shirts & skirts, writing letters when we were in different stations,  first job together ... I can go on and on. From childhood to teens to young women to marriage to motherhood .... Over 3 decades of memories is hard to list. 
Just want you to know that I love you girl! Thanks for being my friend. Thanks for all the encouragement you gave me last night, and always. Thankyou for being there for me all these years. Tight hugs sweetheart ðŸ’•

I could have said all this to her in a watsapp chat, so why say it here. 
Drama peeps, drama! That has also been a part of our ever so colourful lives ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰ .
