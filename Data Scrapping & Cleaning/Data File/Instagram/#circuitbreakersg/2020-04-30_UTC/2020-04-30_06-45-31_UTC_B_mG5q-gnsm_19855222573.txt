Have you ever wondered how exactly does yoga benefit you? 
Yoga is definitely one sport that is suitable for anyone, whether you are looking to heal, strengthen or tone. Its variety of poses and their variations makes it so encompassing. 🧘‍♀️ ➡️ 32 days left to go. 32 days may seem like a long period, but let these simple milestones help you ease into living the next 32 days. 32 days, 12 poses: different poses work on improving different aspects of the body, physiologically and physically. You need not push yourself to achieve the full pose, but simply trying and exploring can allow you to discover your body (and perhaps you CAN actually do! 😉) ❗Please note that we do not recommend going into these poses immediately. Consider complementing these poses with a yoga practice or preparatory poses to enter the poses. Enter and exit the pose slowly and carefully. Remember, your end goal depends on which stage you are at. Everyone is different.
