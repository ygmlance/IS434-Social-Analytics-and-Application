It’s International Jazz Day today so Herbie Hancock’s Maiden Voyage gets the honour. #jazzday was established in 2011 by UNESCO goodwill ambassador #herbiehancock to celebrate this universal art through discussions and an all-star concert (it’s 3am sg tomorrow). Maiden Voyage was released in 1965 and seen by many as his finest record for Blue Note. Can’t say I disagree but he’s got so many great albums why pick 1? Anyway, play some jazz today wherever you are. Post it! Share it!  #maidenvoyage #bluenoterecords #anthonywilliams #georgecoleman #freddiehubbard #roncarter #jazzdayathome
