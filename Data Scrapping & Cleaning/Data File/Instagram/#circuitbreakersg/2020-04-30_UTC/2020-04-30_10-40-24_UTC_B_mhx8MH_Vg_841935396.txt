When WFH also means wearing a different hat at home. So barbers 💈 and hair stylists were told to halt operations during CB period.. Weather was hot ☀️, and my poor boy’s hair is getting long. Being in the finance industry has taught me to calculate on income and expenses.. I personally feel spending $24 to cut his hair is just not worth it 🙅🏻‍♂️ and so I decided to hands on myself 💇🏻‍♂️. #covid19 #wfh #circuitbreakersg #cuthair #handsonactivities
