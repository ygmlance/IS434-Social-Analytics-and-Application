Has been our biggest fan for always taking time out to support me/ my siblings whenever we perform on stage in our school days\n3. Has been a wonderful role model - strong, kind, independent and caring woman (though naggy at times)\n\nFor the past 35 years, she has dedicated her life to my sisters and I, to be a full time housewife and to take care of us and our studies. During this 35 years, she has given up on most things.. even the simplest to go out with friends. Hence, would love to win this for her @leeweechang @meihsing89 @carrebearrrr",

She is the most supportive and most loving mom out there. \u2764\ufe0f I never knew how much she sacrificed and how much she had done for me all these years before I became a mother myself.  She had to bring up 5 kids all by herself. Those though times were hard and we did not have much money, but she was a great mom and took care of us all very well. I didn\u2019t know how difficult it is to be a mom but now I totally feel it and experience it firsthand for myself.  Being a mom definitely is not an easy job. Yet she never complained or made a sound. It was all love and smiles. I really want to be like a mom her but I find it very hard. She is a perfect mom. I can never say enough or ever express fully in words on how much I love her and show how great she is\u2764. Mother's Day is meant to make mothers happy and show great appreciation to our mothers. \u2764 This giveaway is perfect for my dearest mom. I am sure she will be very happy if I can win this gift for her. She is a great mom and she deserves to have the best. \ud83d\udcaf\ud83e\udd47 @ic_life8 @momo_album @friendly_kat",

Given at the age of 6\ufe0f\u20e30\ufe0f\u20e3, you seldom complain about being lethargic even when you need to take care of your grandchildren  during your post-retirement stage.\n2) Teacher\nYou always willingly share your knowledge and principles to help us grow and develop over the years. You never allow us to take things for granted and always remind us to cherish what we have at the present. From the food on the table to the good education you have paid for, you will make us appreciate the values in everything we have!\n3) Friend\nYou naturally show kindness, compassion and interest in our family. Whenever you are \ud83c\udd93, you will spare some time to listen to us and have a good chat with us. You are just like everyone's best friend in the family! \n4) Exemplar\nYou show by the way you live an example of what the family stands for. You will not smoke if you don't want us to do it, and likewise does not drink heavily if you do not want us to do so. You taught us to deal with conflict in our family and with others by being firm but reasonable at the same time! \n5) Patriarch\nYou are honoured because of your moral character and actions. You don't expect us to live the same kind of life you do, and do the same kind of work. You respected our values and opinions, as long as they don't harm the family or anyone else! \n6) Disciplinarian\nYou helped us learn proper boundaries and consequences. You will strongly disapprove any of our misdeeds by using tough love to prove a point. You did this through the power of your words, not your fists. Likewise, you don't reward us for actions that are expected of us, such as helping with house chores or performing well in school!\nThank you for all the selfless sacrifices \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\nI LOVE \ud83d\udc9f YOU MUM \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8b\n@potatoeeeez_ @kwok.james @hing.yuen.52",
