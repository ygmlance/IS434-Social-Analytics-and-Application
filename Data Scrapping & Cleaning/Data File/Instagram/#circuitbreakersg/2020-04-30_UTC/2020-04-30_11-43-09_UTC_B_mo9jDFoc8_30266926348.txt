CB DAY 25 -

PAINT IN THE BAG

Thursdays are marketing day for me, means josiah gets free play for first half of the morning with his papa after school's e-learning.
We only do simple art stuff in the afternoon while meimei naps.

Today we drop some paint (his favorite colors) into a ziplock bag, with art paper, ice cream sticks and pompom balls. He get to paint in a mess-free manner! 
Time spent: 15mins
