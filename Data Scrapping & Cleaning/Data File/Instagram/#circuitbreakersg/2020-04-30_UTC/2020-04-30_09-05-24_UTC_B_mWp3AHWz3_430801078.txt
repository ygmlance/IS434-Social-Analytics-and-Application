Covid19 circuit breaker day 24:

Hahahaha, I was such a noobshit back then LOL. I remembered how happy I was just to get that teeny bit of air and thought it was such a fucking accomplishment already! But fast foward a few years, after some successful attempts and many falls later, I can clear a 2 wake jump quite consistently. LOL but still a noob, just that I’m less noob than last time.

I guess it’s how you see it right? If you’re competitive, who are you competing against? Others or yourself? Who are you comparing with, and why do you need to?

On some occasions, I felt bummed out that I’m not progressing as well as others, and I can’t seem to learn new tricks. But when I look at this video of how I used to ride in the #beninging, I was mighty pleased with myself. 
So yea, it’s ok to be competitive and compare yourself to others, and by all means do what you need to rise above. But also be contented with the fact that you have come so far to be where you’re at.

Provided you put in the effort la. lolol
