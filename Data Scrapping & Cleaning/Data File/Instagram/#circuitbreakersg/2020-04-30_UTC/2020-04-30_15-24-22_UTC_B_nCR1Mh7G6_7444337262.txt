This was what home based teaching looked like the past few weeks in the homes of our educators. We have come to an end for home based learning and we like to say, we miss all of you! 
Thank you to the pedagogical team and educators for working diligently together in creating contents for children. Thank you to the children for showing up in Zoom and participating in the take home kits given. And parents, our greatest supporter, thank you for giving time to participate in Zoom sessions with us and for showering our educators with love (to the extent of delivering items to school!) during this unprecedented time of crisis. 
Stay safe and stay well.
Till we meet again.
