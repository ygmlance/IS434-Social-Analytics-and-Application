Sent some 💖 to a few friends over the weekend with durian cakes in different designs. I’m thankful that a friend who’s licensed helped with the delivery, and I’ve a frozen pack of durian purée from my sis before #circuitbreakersg . All things in life take many conditions (some beyond our control) to materialize and similarly, everyone plays a part in the fight against #covid19. I believe we will all emerge from this battle, stronger and more appreciative of what we have in life. Stay safe, healthy, and happy everyone! 🤩💞
