cream of mushroom, WITHOUT cream. Swipe to see close up texture. 100% no gelat feel. It is so delicious you will not pop another can of instant mushroom soup anymore. Prep time: 5 min. Cook time: 15 mins. 100% mushroom goodness. We used white mushrooms and Shitake (for the fragrance). 1 red and 1 onion, loads and loads of fresh thyme, 110g butter, 1/2 to 1 cup of flour for the creaminess, 1 carton of chicken stock and a shot of Yuzu Choya (this elevates the taste maximum). Slice onions and mushrooms, caramelise onions with oil of choice, once caramelise, add Yuzu Choya. Add in sliced mushrooms. Once shrunk, add butter then add flour after butter has melted. Stir well. Add stock thereafter. Add dash of pepper and thyme. Keep stirring until it boils. Turn off and let sit. Once cool, use stick blender and blend sliced mushrooms and stop once it becomes somewhat a puree. Serve hot!
