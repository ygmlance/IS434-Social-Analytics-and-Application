Afternoon Tea today, was re-steamed Orh Kueh, or Steamed Yam Kueh. These beauties were bought from @kuehs_and_snacks last Friday before they closed shop for the duration of Covid-19. These are particularly tasty, and i like them without using the provided sweet dark soya sauce and chilli sauce. Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #orhkueh #teochewfood #teochewcuisine #sgfood #sgfoodculture #sghawkerfood #sghawkerculture #ourhawkerculture #supportlocalsg #savefnbsg #tapao #kuehsandsnacks #stayathome #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
