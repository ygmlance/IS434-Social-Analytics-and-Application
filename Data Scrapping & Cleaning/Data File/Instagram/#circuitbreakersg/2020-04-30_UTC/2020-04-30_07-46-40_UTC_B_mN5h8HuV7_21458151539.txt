Kuih Bingka Ubi.  2 pieces  missing because my husband ate it before I could snap a photo. it is not a successful bake because taipoca was chopped instead of grated (texture is ricey rather than longish). Grating takes too much time for just 500g, minimally just grating NON stop, minimum 1 hour. I substituted white sugar to brown sugar  so less sweet so that's a small win. I overgrilled the top so it is a bit more done than I expected. I will try again once I can get my hands on grated tapioca. fragrance wise, I think can pass. let's try again!
