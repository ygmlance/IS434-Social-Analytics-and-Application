The Circuit Breakers : a series dedicated to our front line superheroes.

#2: our hygiene and sanitation workers. The jungler. The people with responsibilities that are usually not seen in our fight against the crown and to break the circuit. (especially dedicated to the uncles and aunties that take the job because they need food on their table)

Happy labour day!
