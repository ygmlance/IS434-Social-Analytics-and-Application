Wishing everyone an advanced "Happy Labour Day" from our #wfh @in.d.grey team!

As the #covid_19 infected cases have increased manifold, we would like to express our gratitude and say a big THANK YOU to all our migrant and frontline workers during this #circuitbreakersg period.

Join us as we play a small part in giving back through the Labour Day Mask Donation Drive, organised by @swiftymasketeers to provide PFE% tested masks for the Migrant & Frontline Workers at the newly converted OCBC Arena Halls.
