You don't need to always structure your plan and schedule.

Sometimes is good to have an empty slot in your schedule and see what surprises you get.

I always have an empty slot on our timetable and that's where I always get creative ideas from the kids. From there, I also get to know them better what they like and what they donâ€™t.

How are you at home with the kids and what surprises do you get from them so far?
