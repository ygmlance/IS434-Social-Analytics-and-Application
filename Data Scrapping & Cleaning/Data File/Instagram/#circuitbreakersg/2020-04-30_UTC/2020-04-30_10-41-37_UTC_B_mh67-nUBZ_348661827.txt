Been having these crazy unreal dreams lately. Don’t know if it’s because I’ve been watching way too much horror and zombie movies but I wake up feeling like I got hit by a truck. Or it could be the insane amount of alcohol I’ve been consuming...
But I realise in #thetimeofcovid I fucking love naps..onto my 5th nap. Loving these rainy late afternoons. And if you don’t sleep naked, you have not lived...I guess that’s why they invented PJs...people be touching themselves all night long otherwise 🤷‍♀️#stayhome
