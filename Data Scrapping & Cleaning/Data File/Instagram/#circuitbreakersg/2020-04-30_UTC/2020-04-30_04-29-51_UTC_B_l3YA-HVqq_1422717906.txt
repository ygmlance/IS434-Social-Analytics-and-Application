Hopping onto the bandwagon. I have been watching my family, @singaporemaven and @sungoddesstarot, adapt to this #circuitbreakersg by #EmbracingNewNorms . I have been able to maintain healthy work-life choices, which leaves me with no excuse to neglect my own health and social wellbeing. I'm accepting this challenge from @sungoddesstarot , who has always been my motivation for creating and embracing healthy work-life choices.

@davidbeckham and @aiasingapore , here's how I’ve been staying active at home and #EmbracingNewNorms for #HealthierLongerBetterLives !

As a Financial Services Consultant representing @aiasingapore , the grind and learning never stops. Weekly meetings, continuous updates, and disseminating information to consultants, as well as weekly Sales Builder meetings have become more vital in helping consultants to adapt to the current situation and to perfect our Non-Face-To-Face sales processes. With that, here is how I spent my team Sales Builder session earlier this morning. What keeps me going in this line is the continuous support of my family, friends, my company, @aiasingapore . Because of them, I'm able to help my clients plan their finances and protect their wellbeing in the long run.

I hereby challenge my fellow #AIASG family, and all of you in my friend list in Instagram and Facebook to the @aiasingapore #EmbracingNewNorms Challenge! Simply follow the steps below and you stand to win $50 worth of shopping vouchers:
