Why are strawberries so pretty ugh. Wanted to do something nice with the layout of the drink, but they floated away in the end :') didn't have enough ice to hold them down. (it's okay you learn as you go!) As for the strawberry compote, I diced the strawberries and placed them in a container. Added in lemon juice and sugar and left it in the fridge overnight. Super easy to make! I think the recipe can be quite easily found online as well. 
Add the strawberry compote, ice cubes, milk and some whisked matcha. Enjoy!
