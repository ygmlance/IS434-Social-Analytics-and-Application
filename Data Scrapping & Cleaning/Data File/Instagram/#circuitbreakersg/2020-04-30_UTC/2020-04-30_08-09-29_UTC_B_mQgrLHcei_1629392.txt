Things I do on a leave day, trying to draw a line with work and personal time with wfh arrangements. Heading out, packing comfort food from plain vanilla, then crash on the sofa, armed with a book while listening to the violent rumblings from the skies and the sound of rain. 
Counting the little blessings in life. ðŸŒ±
