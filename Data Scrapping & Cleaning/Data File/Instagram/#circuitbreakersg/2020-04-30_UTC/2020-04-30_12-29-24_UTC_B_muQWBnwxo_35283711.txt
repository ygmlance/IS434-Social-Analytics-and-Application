Kits4Kids Singapore - Happy May Day 2020!

There is nothing more beautiful than smiling and making others smile. 
It's another bright starting point to encourage unstructured exploration, contemplation and daydreaming that often spurs creativity in a world with differences, not difficulties.

Thank you everyone as we support and donated 600 food packs to both migrant and essential workers as part of our May Day 2020 observation.

We Believe Every Child Can Learn

Nonetheless, Happy 17th Anniversary to Kits4Kids Foundation.
