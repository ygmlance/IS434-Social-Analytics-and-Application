Whenever clients tell me they hope to have a walk-in wardrobe, I will ask the million-dollar question â€“ with or without cabinet doors? To which many will likely reply: WITHOUT â€˜cos otherwise it defeats the purpose of a walk-in concept. Also, most people imagine a very sleek look when it comes to their walk-in wardrobe where everything looks SUPER NEAT and ORGANISED.

BUT! In their little fantasies, many people also fail to consider the fact that most of our clothes are not pristine white shirts nor sharp black ones unlike the photos you see of many walk-in wardrobes.

On the contrary, many folksâ€™ outfits are of CHUPPALANG COLOURS.... macham rainbowðŸŒˆ.
+
Thatâ€™s why I usually advise that we keep the doors of the cabinets, especially if the doors to the walk-in wardrobe are made of glass, like what you see in my photos.

The only good thing about this Covid saga is that I can wear tees and shorts to work. Donâ€™t need to think about what to wear. Ok who am I really kidding... I am always wearing the same stuff to work till my friends can spot IMMEDIATELY when I meet them wearing something new. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
