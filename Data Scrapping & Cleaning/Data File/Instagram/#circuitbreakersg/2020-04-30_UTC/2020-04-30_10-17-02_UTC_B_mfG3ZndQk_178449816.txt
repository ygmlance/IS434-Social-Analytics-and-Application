Day 24 of #CircuitBreakerSg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Made a new dish I've never ever made in my life but eaten numerous times at Japanese restaurants. Katsu Don! Crispy chicken, scrambled eggs and onions in a savoury sweet sauce, hands up if you love this dish too!
.
I cheated a bit though. I used @Sadia.sg's Breaded Chicken Cutlets so that I wouldn't have to fry my own, so more time to spend doing HBL with @Edward365! So easy to use these breaded chicken, just put it in the oven for 15 minutes, while I tend to the onions. They are good on their own too, skin is crispy and the thighs are tender and juicy! You can get these at at the supermarket frozen section.
.
There are many recipes out there for cooking the onions and eggs, most call for mirin and vegetable stock. Unfortunately, I didn't have any so I omitted both. The resulting dish is still quite nice, even if it is not the most authentic. Here's my Circuit Breaker Katsu Don Recipe....
.
What you need (3 pax portion):
1 - 2 large onions
4 eggs
2 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp soya sauce
1 tbsp mirin (I used shaoxing wine)
1/2 cup vegetable stock (I used water)
.
Method:
1. Slice onions into fine strips and saute in pan until soft. 
2. Add everything else except eggs and simmer the onions. 
3. Meanwhile whip the 4 eggs .
4. Add in the eggs when the liquid has reduced by more than half. Cook to preferred level of firmness.
.
This is my short cut method using minimal ingredients! Feel free to make more sauce to drizzle over the final dish.
