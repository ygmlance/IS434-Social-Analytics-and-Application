Health and happiness start with the gut. It's important to nourish ourselves as we get through these uncertain times. A medley of red cabbage, Napa cabbage, cucumber, zucchini, butternut pumpkin, beetroot, button mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and broccoli - our Big Raw Salad is incredibly rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Plus, it looks as good as it tastes.
