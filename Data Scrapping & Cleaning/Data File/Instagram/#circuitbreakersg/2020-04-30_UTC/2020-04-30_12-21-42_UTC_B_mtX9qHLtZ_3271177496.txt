Throwback to happier times pre-Circuit Breaker. The prawn noodles at Prawnholic are highly lauded by food bloggers and unlike any other in Singapore. /

The Special Prawn Noodles ($6.50) came with two prawns, a homemade prawn ball, and generous servings of pork lard. Break the onsen egg (+ $1) and mix it into the noodles with the amazing sauce, and you get an unbeatable dish. /

However where @prawnaholic leaves the competition trailing is the addition of a piece of torched kurobuta pork. Simultaneously sweet and savoury while evoking a smokey essence, this piece of meat alone is worthy of a Michelin star. /

However I found the soup, though intensely flavourful, overly salty. One of the components I enjoy most in a bowl of prawn noodles is its broth, but here it falls short. I couldn't go more than two spoonfuls without reaching for a glass of water. /

I know all of us can't wait for the Circuit Breaker to be over, and once the ban on dining out is lifted, we'd all flock to our favourite eateries. Prawnaholic is on my list.
