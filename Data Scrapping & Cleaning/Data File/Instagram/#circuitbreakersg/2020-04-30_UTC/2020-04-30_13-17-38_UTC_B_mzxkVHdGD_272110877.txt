Day 23. A drastic change of weather today. Nevertheless, it did not dampen our mood for a long weekend! Breakfast - added sweet potatoes to the staple. ðŸ˜‚ Dinner - Mr. prepared a tomato stew, pan fried lamb chops, grilled asparagus! What a good way to end the week! #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #stormwasbrewing #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeals #spendingtimewithfamily #instadaily
