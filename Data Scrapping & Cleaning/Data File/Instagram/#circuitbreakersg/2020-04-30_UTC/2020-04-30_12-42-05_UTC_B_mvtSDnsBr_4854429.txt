After watching YouTube, the girls recycle their old socks and make dresses for their Barbie. They only use a pair of ✂️ for these Barbie dresses. At least this activity can keep them occupy for half an hour. I am staying home and thinking of what I can reuse, reduce and recycle my household stuff. Thinking and learning changes everything.  @aiweineo @apple_joanne08 take the challenge. #stayhomeforsg #sgUnited #imstayinghome #mirabellemikayla #stayhomechallenge #sgkids #circuitbreakersg
