Work from home view ❤️ think #reubengreedyngiam is the happiest with this arrangement 😂 I sometimes feel like a mad woman rushing ard work, computer screen, client calls, cooking, housework and being tired. But still truly thankful for it all, for home, for time with hubs, for time with reubs, for the struggle so I can learn how to grow in drawing boundaries and making time for what’s important, for being able to settle into our new home in this time too! 😊 nothing can be better than being in His time and plans as we learn to move with Him in this space. Being stuck at home yes, but really helped me sharpen the skill to decide what’s really important and focus on what’s necessary. Looking forward to continue to grow and put Him first in my life in the midst of all these craziness. #blessedandloved #godisgood #nidyjourney #wfh #circuitbreakersg
