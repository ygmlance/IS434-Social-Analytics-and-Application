<8 Crabs>⁣
𝐂𝐑𝐀𝐁𝐒 & 𝐙𝐈 𝐂𝐇𝐀𝐑 𝐃𝐄𝐋𝐈𝐕𝐄𝐑𝐘⁣
Looking for a tasty supper? 8 Crabs is an online delivery service that delivers crabs and seafood amongst other classic zi char dishes right to your doorstep 😃. Delivery time starts from 12:30PM till 11PM, so if it’s at night and the time slot allows, you can still opt for express delivery where the food items will be delivered within an hour.⁣
⁣
Crabs come in three flavours - 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢, 𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐏𝐞𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐫 and 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐄𝐠𝐠. Had the XL Signature Award-Winning Chilli Crab 🦀; as it is a huge crab, it is satisfyingly meaty yet without being overcooked nor dry!⁣
⁣
Another showstopper is the 𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐅𝐢𝐬𝐡 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐝 $𝟑𝟐 (𝐔.𝐏. $𝟑𝟖) which is absolutely splendid. There is a lot of meat in the fish head and it goes really well with the thick flavoursome curry 😍.⁣
