WATER BALLOONS ðŸŽˆ
â€¢
Hello guys! This must be my favourite activity at home thus far! I can touch and squish these balloons for hours on end ðŸ¤£Mummy simply filled up coloured balloons with a bit of water ðŸ’¦ and taped them down on the peripheries of my cot (or more aptly, my playpen ðŸ˜‡)
â€¢
It was a new experience trying to walk around the cot (with support of the rails, of course) and â€˜capturingâ€™ each balloon. Mummy asked me to gently touch and feel the balloons each time I reached one, but I much preferred to yank them out and throw them away. Maybe next time I should do javelin or short put HAHA ðŸ¤—
â€¢
Btw I kept putting the balloons into my mouth and they tasted ewww, but it was a good chance for me to learn about a new texture AND more importantly, what not to put into my mouth! ðŸ˜®
