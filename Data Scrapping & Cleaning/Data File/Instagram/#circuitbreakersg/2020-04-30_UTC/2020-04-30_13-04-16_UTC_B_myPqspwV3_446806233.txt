Workout, Cook and Sing. 
What else can you do at home? This has been a great preparation period for me. It helped me rethink how I can approach my career in a different way. The amount of time I have at home makes me so creative, thinking of different content I can put up for cooking, working out and singing. I enjoyed answering questions about the exercises I shared on my IG, that made me more certain of my craft.  I’m not a trained cook, so I’m just sharing some recipes I found on YouTube and putting them up in my own way. I’m not trying to be a master chef but hopefully good enough just to feed my little family. Last but not least is the FB and IG Live on Friday nights where @keweitay and me will sing and interact with friends and supporters on our social media. The most exciting part is when ppl will comment to thank us for the entertainment, and that our singing made their day. 
What’s yours? What have you been doing and do you feel any sense of achievement?
