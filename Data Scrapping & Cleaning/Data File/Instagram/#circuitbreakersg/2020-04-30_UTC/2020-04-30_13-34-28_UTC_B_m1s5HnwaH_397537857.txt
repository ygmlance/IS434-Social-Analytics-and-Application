#CircuitBreakerSG D-24
Bibimbap is another favourite Korean dish that I love. It's mixed rice with saut√©ed and seasoned vegetables, a bit of hot pepper paste and some optional meat.

We're having 8 sides here; Carrot, Cucumber, Kimchi, Soya Beansprout, Capsicum, Wakame, Teriyaki Pork & Sunnysides.

Simply arrange the vegetables & meat on a bowl of steamy rice topped with an egg, gochujang, soy sauce & sesame oil.

Also serving a bowl of warm Soya Bean Sprout Wakame Soup & fresh Orange Juice.

Happy #dinner, it's long weekend, ie. no alarm days.
