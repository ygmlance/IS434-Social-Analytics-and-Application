𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟐𝟒 - All you knead is a good loaf of bread to #focaccia troubles! 🤯🥖🍞⁣

Featuring my ridiculously easy & fail-proof 𝙍𝙤𝙨𝙚𝙢𝙖𝙧𝙮 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙂𝙖𝙧𝙡𝙞𝙘 𝙁𝙤𝙘𝙖𝙘𝙘𝙞𝙖 that’s crusty, chewy & aromatic! 😋⁣

I’ve been avoiding #baking bread (even though I’ve a bread machine) cos of the high failure rate! 99% of the time, my bread didn’t turn out well.  So imagine my joy when I slice my focaccia!! 🥳

Focaccia is so easy to make as there’s no kneading involved.  I made my dough and left it overnight in my fridge, took it out this morning when I woke up, left it in room temperature for few hours while I work and popped it in the oven during #lunchtime! Probably the easiest #bread to make! The smell of freshly-baked bread is 😍👌🏻🍞🥖
