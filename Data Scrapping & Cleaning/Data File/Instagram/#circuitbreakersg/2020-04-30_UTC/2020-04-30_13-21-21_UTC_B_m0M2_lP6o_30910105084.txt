Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 24:
Sorry this picture doesn't look great because I forgot to take a photo of before digging into our meal.

Feeling tired from cooking so many meals on a daily basis the past month, so mum surprised me with a special dinner delivery earlier this week!

Mum ordered a set meal for each of us from @hattendo_singapore and also added on ready-made protein for us so that we could keep it for the next day. Again, no pics of the set meal we had on Tuesday as I was starving ðŸ˜… Pictured here is the sous vide grilled chicken while hubs had their signature iberico pork belly - he loved it! Super tender but you have to be a fan of fatty meat to appreciate this.

My favorites were the hamburg steak and chicken breast. So so so good! Thanks mum for the treat!
