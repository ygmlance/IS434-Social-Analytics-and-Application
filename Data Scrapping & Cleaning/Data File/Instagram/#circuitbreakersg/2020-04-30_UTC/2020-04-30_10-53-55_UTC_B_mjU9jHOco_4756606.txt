🍲Day 24/56•StayHome Dinner 
Today's yummy dinner was courtesy of my MiL. She cooked a big pot of Bak Kut Teh & Yam Rice then packed a portion for us. 👵 She's currently living alone, so my hubby will make a quick trip to her place once a week to make sure everything's ok (besides the standard phone calls) and pick up the food she prepared too. I guess this weekly cooking is something she looks forward to, keeps her occupied, since she no longer can mingle with her neighbours & friends during this #CircuitBreakerSG period.
