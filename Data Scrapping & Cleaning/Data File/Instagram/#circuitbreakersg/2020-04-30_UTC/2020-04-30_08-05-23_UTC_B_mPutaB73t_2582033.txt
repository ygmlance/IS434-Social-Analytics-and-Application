Itâ€™s all about the base x2 ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¶ to achieve a succulent Char Kway Teow ! Yeah , you need a good amount of oil to get that silky smooth uniformly fried kway Teow .
ðŸŒ¶The chilli base can be prepared well in advance , and can be used to also fry any other noodles , for eg Mee Goreng Mamak or Mee Goreng - Malay Style OR as a condiment for your Hokkien Mee - .. so my sambal base is kinda multi- racial ðŸ˜…
ðŸŒ¶ once you have the chilli base , frying takes less than 15 mins if you have all other ingredients lined up !
