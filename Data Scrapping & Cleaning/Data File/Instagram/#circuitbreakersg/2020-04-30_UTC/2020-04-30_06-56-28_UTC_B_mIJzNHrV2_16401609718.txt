🔨WOODWORKING 🔨
We explored on woodworking 🔨 today. 
A great tinkering activity for our little ones to experience how wooden toys are made. It was a #freeplay with no instructions given from the manufacturer. We tried our best figuring things out from the pictures on the package. It was tricky knocking on nails without proper working bench but we managed to do it somehow 👏
Our little ones may find this activity tedious especially if the one guiding them lacks the experience as well 🤣 
Don’t give up and persevere on 💪🏼
Once you get the hang of it, it can even be therapeutic. Well at least it was for me 🤩Hu managed to make a part of the table while Ha was happy exploring the nails before they had enough. ⚠️ always supervise our little ones. 
I continued making the table and jeep for my little ones. Decent work for someone who is not a handyman 🤣
Happy woodworking guys 💕
