🏡 Downsized from 5-RM to 4-RM in Pasir Ris⠀
⠀
Initially, these parents had around 7-8 people living in their current 5-RM flat, inclusive of themselves. One by one, their children got married and moved out after collecting their own flat 🏠⠀
⠀
And that leaves them with just 4 people in the household now. Their 5-RM is still under HDB Loan with over $100,000 balance to clear off 😱⠀
⠀
Hence, they made the decision to downsize to a 4-RM flat to ease their financial burden. Hubby wants to avoid paying housing installment by cash when he turns 55 very soon (retirement age). They want to use the money from the sale of their 5-RM flat to fully pay for their next home to release themselves of any stress, finance-related. ⠀
⠀
They are looking minimal cash on renovation for their next purchase and within the same cluster in Pasir Ris East. ⠀
⠀
However, many units in the market are not renovated, or have Ethnic Quota restriction (difficult for Malay race buyers to buy) and clients want a unit in Pasir Ris East only which has limited supply of units available. ⠀
⠀
✔️Bonus Achievement⠀
▪️Fully renovated unit⠀
▫️Much higher floor than previous houses owned⠀
▪️More centralised location between MRT, Downtown East, Pasir Ris Park & Beach and Pasir Ris East Market⠀
▫️Walking distance to above amenities mentioned⠀
⠀
Congratulations to my clients for their new home❗️⠀

Stay safe, stay healthy and stay home everybody 🙆🏻‍♂️⠀
