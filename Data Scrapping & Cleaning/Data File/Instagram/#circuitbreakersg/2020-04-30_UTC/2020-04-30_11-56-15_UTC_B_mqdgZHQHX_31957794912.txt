Tough week calls for an epicurean delight. Didnâ€™t have lunch & I was craving for Har Cheong Gai but I ran out of shrimp paste n Iâ€™m no master at HCG so decided to heck it n make do with whatever ingredients Iâ€™ve instead. Korean style garlic honey soy glaze wings here where I up the spice level with peppercorns & chilli flakes. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ¶ made some garlic black pepper chive mashed to go along too. Totally hedonistic but who cares. Wash it all down with a swig of ice cold beer. Divine! Iâ€™m no K-drama fan but interestingly, I hear that whatever that comes with honey glaze is always korea inspired.  how true is that? ðŸ¤”

Generously douse the wings with plain flour, some pepper n salt. I added some garlic powder here for some punch but optional. Prepare the glaze with light soy sauce n garlic cloves or u can use garlic granules too. Add honey, some water n if u want to spice it all up n have bee-stung lips since itâ€™s the Long weekend, by all means do so! Peppercorns n chilli if u like. .ðŸ‘„ðŸ‘…
.
Brown the wings in a pan of heated oil for about 5 mins n then transfer to the oven to roast at 180 degrees for about 20mins. Take it out n glaze the sauce on BOTH sides n plonk back in the oven for another 10 mins. U will be hungrier each minute when the aroma of the wings n sauce starts to kick in n u know when itâ€™s ready to be eaten. .

Potato mashed is idiot-proof. Just boil potatoes till soft n mix in salted butter so I donâ€™t have to use salt. Throw in chives, black pepper n some garlic. There you go carbo Addict friend! ðŸ¤©
