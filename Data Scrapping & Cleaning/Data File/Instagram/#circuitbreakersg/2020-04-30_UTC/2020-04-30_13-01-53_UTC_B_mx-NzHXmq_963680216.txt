Bubble tea and burgers go together like 💛🧡If this sounds like the perfect combination (of course it is) get your fingers scrolling 'cos WOLF Burgers has teamed up with Gong Cha to bring us the best ever #CB meal -- trust us; we've tried it (and are still in a pleasantly hazy food coma about six hours after...)
.
1️⃣ First things first: WOLF Burgers (which has the  juiciest patties and a drool-some smoky umami sauce) has a newly launched menu that's exclusively available at GrabKitchen at Hillview.
.
What's unique about this is that Instead of the usual brioche buns, WOLF uses steamed baked buns that have a lightly toasted exterior and a soft, fluffy centre. They hold up well during the delivery process without turning soggy. Perfect for home delivery!

What to try:
.
🍔Alpha ($13.90) – two juicy beef patties, served with double melted cheddar cheese, tangy pickled onions, and the signature umami WOLF Burger sauce.
.
🍔Apex ($13.90) – melt-in-your-mouth Wagyu beef patty, cheddar cheese, sautéed onions and mushrooms topped with creamy mayonnaise.
.
🍔Timberwulf ($7.90) - thick, crispy juicy chicken thigh topped with cheddar cheese, fresh homemade coleslaw and tangy honey mustard.
.
👧🏻👦🏻 For the kids: Wolf Pup ($6.90) and Wolf Guppy ($6.90) -- fried chicken and fried fish burgers using slider buns.

2️⃣ Next up: For WOLF x Gong Cha deals, head to Grabfood or to www.wolfburgers.com where you can order your favourite burgers and FOUR types of bubble tea as well!
.
🥦🍟🌽Need more? Sides like Loaded Fries (wicked good!), Truffle Fries (super good), Corn (can't go wrong with this), and Broccoli ('cos everyone needs a bit of green) will fill them up.
.
Verdict: The kids LOVED this meal, which makes WOLF Burgers my new favourite place in the world. 😄
