It's the start of a long weekend. So I air-fried some potatoes as #homemade chips. I accidentally poured more truffle oil than I originally intended. So it's a treat for the Simlets! Lol. Unsalted ones for them, salted ones for us, using my all time favourite Iceland #lavasalt by #saltverk Weekend smells good already. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #trufflefries  #sgmummy #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomewithascott #saltverk
