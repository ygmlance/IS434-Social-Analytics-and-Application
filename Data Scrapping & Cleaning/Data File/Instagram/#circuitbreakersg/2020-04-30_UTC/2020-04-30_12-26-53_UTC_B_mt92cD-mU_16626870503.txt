Wanton noodle (dry version) for dinner.  Made the noodles yesterday (it’s actually tomato garlic noodles 🤣) and apart from the wanton wrap, the rest are all from scratch. ⁣

The char siew is really one of our favourite dish made with Thermomix. It’s so tender and juicy as it is cooked in Thermomix for about 1/2 hour and then char it in oven for just 10 minutes. ⁣

Let’s feed our loved ones with the best! ❤️❤️❤️⁣
