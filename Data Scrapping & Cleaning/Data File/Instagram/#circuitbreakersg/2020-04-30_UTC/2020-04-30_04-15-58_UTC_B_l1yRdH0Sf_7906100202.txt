If you spend time reading books with your preschooler, you are modelling early reading strategies that your child will need to succeed in reading in Kindergarten. 
Simple observations such as the front of the book, the use of pictures and words, turning the page and reading from left to right! 
You are modelling correct reading practices that your child is observing and will try to imitate!
