I'm really getting the hang of #circuitbreakersg. Life is routined but fulfilling because I set goals daily and I achieved them. I get to do more of what I love, cooking for my loved ones. I get to start on a weights training regime and people noticed the change in my physique. I get to work on my passion and also help my company embark on a digital transformation journey. I get more quiet and intimate moments with my kids. I meditate more. I experiment more. I reiki more. #lifeisbeautiful #contentment #mypreciouszel
