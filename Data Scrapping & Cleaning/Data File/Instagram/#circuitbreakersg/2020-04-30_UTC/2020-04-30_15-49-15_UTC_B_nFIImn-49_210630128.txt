Too lazy to cook...so decided to order from #kianseng 
Their bento were still warm when it reached our place and omg...the steamed pork belly (虾香蒸猪肉) is my favourite...have that old school taste and reminds me of dishes in hongkong like 南乳焖猪肉 🥰🥰🥰 回味无穷啊。。。
As they have run out of drinks during delivery...their boss made special house delivery just to deliver the drinks to us! Really a worth well meal and excellent customer service!
