Hello everyone,
Thank you for joining us today on our LIVE Rainbow fish story theatre session. 
Today, in our LIVE session besides storytelling using puppets, we learnt about Ocean zone layer through Art&Craft. We also made an ocean sensory bottle to recap on the ocean zone layer. 
Other fun activities to engage your little ones to learn about ocean zone layers can be a simple set up with just vinegar and baking soda. Somehow my boys love playing and watching it. As we are learning on Chinese words, “蓝，很，海”, I use different shades of blue to explore these Chinese words in our sensory play. Swipe left to view some videos and pictures of it. 
Our LIVE lesson will only be available at @thejoylearners’s instagram story till tomorrow at 4pm. This story theatre would not be possible with the use of @playgoalz learning felts.
