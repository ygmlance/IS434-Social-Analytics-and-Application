𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟐𝟒 - What better way to enjoy freshly-baked #focaccia than with some hearty not-so-traditional 𝙎𝙝𝙖𝙠𝙨𝙝𝙪𝙠𝙖? 🍅🍳 ⁣

Been wanting to cook Shakshuka for the longest time but couldn’t find canned tomatoes. Made do with what I have at home and added more cherry tomatoes. Mine’s not authentic as I omitted peppers (I dislike ‘em!) and added bacon bits for that touch of smokiness! #無肉不歡 ⁣

PS: No prize for guessing what eggs I used for my Shakshuka! Yes, @nuyolksg eggs again! Omgg~~ love the bright-orangey yolk! Swipe left for some #eggporn! 🍳 ⁣
