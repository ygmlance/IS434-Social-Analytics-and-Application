🕌 MATCHING ACTIVITY 🕌 
Incorporated ice cream🍦sticks to their matching activity of 5 (٥) Pillars of Islam ☪️. There were no words attached to Hu's pictures since I wanted him to practise recognising the words and match the pictures to the corresponding words on the fingers 🖐 accordingly. 
While Ha's was more of a freestyle #sensoryplay mainly for her to push and pull the ice cream🍦 sticks in and out of the box 📦💕
