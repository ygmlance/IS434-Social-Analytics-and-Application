REMY'S RATATOUILLE 
I was fascinated by this dish, Ratatouille from Pixar movie. Love the presentation of this dish. Surprisingly it's easy to prepare and it's packed with healthy and fresh vegetables. The steps for how to make ratatouille are really simple, just make the sauce, layer and bake!

I used Zucchini, Eggplant, Tomato, Onion, Yellow & Red Bell Pepper for this stew. 🍆🍅🥒 ( you can use other vegetables too) You also need Dill 🌿 (you can add other herbs), Parsley, Garlic, Salt, Pepper and Olive Oil. Try making this casserole at home, it's worth the effort. If Ling can cook, "anyone can cook" too! 👍

Using #ninjafoodiop300 Pressure & Crisping Lid for this meal:
🔹Select SEAR/SAUTÉ and set to High. Cook the roasted pepper sauce, layer the vegetables (for easy layering, try to buy vegetables that are similar in size/diameter) add herbal seasoning sauce.
.
🔹Place Pressure Lid. Select PRESSURE and set to LOW. Set time to 3 mins. When pressure cooking is complete, quick release the pressure by moving the pressure release valve to the Vent position. Carefully remove lid when unit has finished releasing pressure.
.
🔹Change to Crisping Lid. Place reversible rack in pot over stew, make sure rack is in the higher position. Place Lemon Mayo Salmon on rack.
.
🔹Select GRILL and set time to 12-15 mins. Check salmon after 10 mins. Select AirCrisp and set for 5 mins. Check after 2 mins for desired crispness. Love my Salmon so much, it's crispy from the outside and so moist in the inside 👍
.
🔹When cooking is complete, remove salmon from rack, serve with pasta and ratatouille as side. Add more roasted peppers sauce on pasta. Garnish with fresh dill and parsley and VOILÀ!
