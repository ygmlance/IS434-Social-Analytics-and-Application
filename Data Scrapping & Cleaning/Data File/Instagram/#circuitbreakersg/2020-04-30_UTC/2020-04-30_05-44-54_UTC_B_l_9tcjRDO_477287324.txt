Last nite's dinner - Claypot Chicken Rice in rice cooker. Meant to cook extra for 2 days but 失手 too much water hence rice abit wet. I dare not follow to the T for dark sauce as i wasnt sure if it will be too salty. Not bad for a start but darker i think would be more appetisting..... never mind will try again. 我回加油and 再来一次. Thanks @ann_journal for the easy to follow recipe.
