☆May 2020 Zoom Workshops☆
New Zoom workshops ready for registrations now!

Head over to the link in my BIO Profile to access the link.

Kindly ensure you have the necessary pastel materials setup and feel free to contact me for recommendations or advices on alternative tools.

For workshops marked with * , please make sure there is at least 1 week of allowance from payment confirmation to allow ample time for  materials to be mailed over. While courier delivery via third party services are not allowed during #circuitbreakersg period, I have verified via the official MTI hotline (on 27 April) that regular mailing via Singpost is allowed. As such, non-bulky items such as paper materials or gel pens for galaxy art workshop can still be mailed over.

My participants will know I value small-class teachings to give ample attention and guidance to everyone, even more so in a digital classroom. Do register early to secure your seats.

20% of all sales proceeds (including workshop registrations) during 8 April - 31 May 2020 goes to @foodfromtheheart ! Join me in my fundraising cause today!

See you and stay creative!
