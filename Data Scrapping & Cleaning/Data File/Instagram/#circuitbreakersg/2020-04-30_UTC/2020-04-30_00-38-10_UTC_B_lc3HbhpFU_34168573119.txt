Michael Faberâ€™s The Crimson Petal and the White is one of my all time favourite books. And in case you were wondering, yes, I seriously do read epic tomes like this on e-readers. ðŸ˜†

5/5 Stars ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ If you enjoy historical fiction and want to read another side to the British Victorian era in a style you have never experienced before then this is the book for you. The opening is enough to pull you right into the world of Sugar.

Sugar is a character we wouldnâ€™t normally hear from in other books set in this time, which makes this such an interesting read. I donâ€™t want to give too much away, but I particularly enjoyed the contrast between Sugar and Agnes in terms of their characters and their lives. This book left me wondering which of them had been dealt the better hand. Itâ€™s a must read, but definitely not for the faint of heart! #thecrimsonpetalandthewhite #circuitbreakersg #amreading #maydayweekend #lockdown #quarantinereading #onebookatatime
