[#StayHomeStayLit2020] here's a throwback picture where i had the opportunity to go to @ethosbooks's 2019 preview night and chanced upon notes after terawih by ziks & met the author herself! ✨ now available at @wardahbooks & @booksactually (check out their online stores with free delivery deals!) 📚⁣⁣
⁣⁣
of course, i just had to reread this during ramadhan & it really hits hard especially during this circuit breaker period. 😩 honestly this ramadhan already feels really different without being able to have a mass family iftar or do terawih prayers at the mosque since all the mosques are temporarily closed. 🕌 ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
rereading this makes me feel more grateful of the times we had the opportunity to be together & it really makes me miss doing prayers with all the makciks beside me and our encounters. 😂🤣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
at the same time, this book makes me feel at ease as ramadhan during this period may seem disheartening but it makes me realise that everyone has a choice to embrace this ramadhan 🥰 ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
with that being said, happy ramadhan to everyone! 💚💪 ⁣⁣
⁣you can also know more on how this book came about by going to @ethosbooks IG story under "ziks takeover" 👍⁣
