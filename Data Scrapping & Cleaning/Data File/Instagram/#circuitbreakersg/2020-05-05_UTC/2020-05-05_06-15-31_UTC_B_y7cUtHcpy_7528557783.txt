Hello everyone,
I am the guest host for #funplaywithchinese this week. This week, we are doing on “日常生活” and ”家” is one of the prompts. 
Thus, I decided to start of this week with an activity on “谁在我的家?” [Peek-a-boo,谁在我的家?] Things to prepare:
1) An A3 sized drawing block
2) Yellow construction paper cut outs
3) Photos of your family members 
4) Permanent marker and ruler

Book read 家 from odonatabooks 
To help your child in recognising Chinese words like “爸爸，妈妈，弟弟，爷爷，奶奶，外婆，外公, get your child to paste the pictures in the little houses. 
After that, have a fun time playing “peek-a-boo” Chinese words recognition game. Call out the name of the family members and get your child to open the door.” Isaac the 20 months old also had fun playing with this activity. 
Join me this week for #funplaywithchinese on 日常生活 and don’t forget to tag me so that I could repost your post! Prompts for this week theme can be found in @jaslearningwithkids and @mystorytreasury
