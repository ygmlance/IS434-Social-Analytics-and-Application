#travelmemorytuesday A view of St Paul's Cathedral, London. Did you know there has been a cathedral at this location since around 604AD? So that's about 1,400 years and 5 iterations of St Paul's. There is also a traditional belief that before Christianity, a temple to the Roman Goddess of hunt, Diana, stood in the same place! 🏛️
