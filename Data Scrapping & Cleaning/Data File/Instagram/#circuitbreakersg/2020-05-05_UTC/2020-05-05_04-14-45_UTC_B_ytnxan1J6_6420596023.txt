•RECIPE• I was unable to hit the minimum order for a 卤肉饭 the other day so I decided to make my own! Not a fan of big chunks of pork belly so I tried using shabu pork belly. I felt that the taste was not compromised and I only needes about 40 minutes instead of the usual 2-3hours to soften the pork!

Cooking is easy cos it's just dumping everything into a pot. But the prepararion work can be a little tedious! A lot of chopping to do! ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
• 300g shabu pork belly
• 5 cloves garlic, smashed
• 5 shallots, sliced finely
• A few slices of ginger, sliced finely
• 1 onion, chopped finely
• 1 tbsp soy sauce • 1 tbsp mirin
• 1 tbsp hua diao wine
• 1 tbsp oyster sauce
• 1 tbsp dark soy sauce • 1/2 tsp sugar
• 1 tsp mixed spice (got it from a random supermart) • 1 tau kwa cut into four
• 3 hard boiled eggs

METHOD:
1) Fry the shallots till crispy light brown and fragrant
2) Push it aside and add onion, garlic and ginger. 
3) Continue frying till it's fragrant and soft. Add in the spice and mix well. 
4) Add in the pork over high heat and mix well. The fats should remove the glaze caused by the onion. 5) Add in the condiments and add enough water just to cover the pork.
6) Simmer over high heat for our 10 mins. Add in the eggs and tau kwa to make sure it's fully submerged in the sauce. 
5) Turn to low heat and continue simmering till desired texture. Add in a little water if it gets too dry. You won't want too much gravy. Stir occasionally to make sure that the ingredients are coated evenly. ============================================================ #pork #braisedporkrice #30minutemeals #30minutesrecipe #simple #sgig #sgrecipes #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodstep #instagfoodsg #singaporehomecooks #taiwanfood #homecookedmeals #whati8today #instagfoodsg #家常便饭 #sgfoodlover #onepotmeal #comfortfoods #circuitbreakersg
