She left her job and chose to stay home to take care of the family after dad left us.

She wasn\u2019t good at cleaning, but she always ensure the home is well maintained and clean for us to stay in. She wasn\u2019t good at baking, but she learned it herself, just so she can bake a cake on our birthdays. She never fails to bake a cake on every of our birthdays. She learns activities we like, just so she can communicate and blend in with us. She put in extra effort when things are not second nature to her. \nHer tasks are as endless as the many hats a stay-at-home parent wears: housekeeper, chef, accountant, interior designer, planner, chauffeur, nurse, therapist, playmate, educator, etc.\n\nThis journey as a single mother wasn't easy but she made it. She is brave, independent and strong. \nI am grateful to have her shower me with her love and attention. \nI am glad to have her standing by me, even when i am being difficult. \nI am blessed to have her holding my small hands all these while and never once thought of letting it go. \nThank you for loving me when I am so hard to love. \u2764\ufe0f",

Flying halfway round the world to have ice cream with me when I couldn\u2019t handle being away from home on exchange, flying across continents to pick up luggage from my second brother when he was on exchange even if it meant excess baggage for them and not even catching a glimpse of him, spending sleepless nights worrying about my youngest brother when he contracted his rare disease that was potentially fatal, giving up her job to take care of dad when he was battling stage four of a rare cancer. Life has dealt us a tough hand but I\u2019ll play the cards in mine and count my forever blessings for a mum like her (: @sinjey",

I still remember the couple of times when I was working part time and got home at 10pm and she had a midnight concall, instead of resting from her long day of work, she would always whip up a meal for me and even prepared my lunch the next day just so I can save extra cash. I always consider myself to be a lucky kid because even up till now, my mum still fixes breakfast for her 3 working children just so we wouldn\u2019t starve before lunch. So thank you mummy for all you\u2019ve done, I hope to pamper you with this package just like how you have pampered us \ud83e\udd70 here\u2019s a short poem for you:\nMarvelling at your immense love for us\nOne that only cares for our happiness\nToo many times I may have taken it for granted, yet your\nHeart is filled with kindness\nEven when we are difficult to love, you are\nReady to be our wonder woman\n@choonggenie",

And also a family whoa are closed enough ! She herself is not educated so she will not blame us on our studies if we did badly ! But still nevertheless she help us in basic words ! But all her 4 kids done her proud , because 4 kids get good results and always top 10 in class without any guidance from parents or tuition ! She give us the best in our life ! For instance when we are young , we might not be rich but my mum will work and get her pay to buy the things we want ! And also everytime when i was in kindergarten , she will bring me to school and fetch me off from school . A mum like her is hard to find , a lady who love her family and willing to give the best ! She is still the one helping me looking after baby because during my after birth , i almost get onto depression but mummy is the one who sacrifice all her time and sleep to help me look after baby till now . So i think she is really a superwoman who deserve a reward . And what's more she help me throughout pregnancy , after birth and confinement and now still helping me looking after baby everyday and night while i went out to work. Her love to me and baby is unconditional love and same to me i love her like how she love us but \nWords cant describe much but still got to say happy mother day ! So hope to win and surprise her ! @xxbeexx__",
