With picky eaters at home, I have to be inventive and sometimes downright sneaky in attempts to surreptitiously get them to eat their vegetables without hearing the dreaded “yuck”.⁣
⁣
Thank you @double_happiness_singapore for introducing their veggie pasta which is made with all natural ingredients, mostly vegetable puree and flour. No artificial colours. No salt. No eggs. No chemicals added. No preservatives. ⁣
⁣
I like that its hardly taste of any of the vegetables. This is good to sneak the less popular veggies into the kids’ diet, such as beetroot. The colours of pasta would encourage them to eat more too!⁣
