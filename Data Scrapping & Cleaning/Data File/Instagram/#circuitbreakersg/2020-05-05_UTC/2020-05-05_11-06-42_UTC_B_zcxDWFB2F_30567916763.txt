#circuitbreakersg day 29

Today’s dinner is simple ABC pork ribs soup, with added kelp and dried mushrooms 🍲 (perfect for this gloomy weather) and vegetable stir fry with beef. .

It’s been raining 🌧 quite a bit recently but I’m not complaining. I actually love gloomy weather because it always put me in a good mood. I know I’m a little strange. 😛 But I’m grateful for this gloomy weather today anyway. 😊 #gratitudediary
