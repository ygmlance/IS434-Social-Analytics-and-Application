[20.20 May 5: Circuit Breaker Day Day 29] Breakfast tastes the best when it's made by yourself. Xav said this tasted better than Starbucks! 
First day of school holidays, the mum uses eye and mouth power (to give instruction and eat) while the kids hands on. Time for their lao bu to sit back right?

So teaming up with #NinjaFoodiOP300, bake mode on, 7 mins for frozen dough and we get crispy, fluffy croissant 🥐! @xavier_chua.sg boiled some eggs, tagged team with Vera to peel off the shells, smashed them, mixed with a table spoon of mayonnaise, add a speckle of grounded black pepper and here's our breakfast! 🥐
