Goodness in a metal bowl. 
Featuring the iconic 'bak chor mee'. üçú It always baffles me how a simple dish like this can actually get screwed up. (I've had tons of bad bowls to know this to be true) Thankfully the random one I tried today was not only value for money ($3.50), it tasted pretty darn good. 
The only downside was the lack of pig's liver and sharp sting of the black vinegar with each slurp. If not, they even included fried lard bits. Score! ‚ú®

Remember to continue bringing your own containers for takeouts, my friends! Let's do our part to help cut down this horrendous waste-generating culture of ours. #circuitbreakersg
