Day 1 Hols = Day 29 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Deadlift and row
#7dayabchallenge

What was I thinking? The abs challenge is really killing me.. But I'm already in it, so 5 days left! Gonna post on my IG story later.. Today's my first time doing #heatherrobertsoncom May Calendar Challenge and trying to get used to her style.. Today's workout had weights so I tried to lighten up with some canned food as alternative. Today's Fat Burning HIIT with Weights combined weights and also body resistance moves and everything done in 2 rounds and with a 30 sec break. I'll adjust my schedule cos I don't think I can cope with weights on so many consecutive days. Maybe go lighter or no weights at all! 
Let's hope this holiday will be a fulfilling one to  #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
