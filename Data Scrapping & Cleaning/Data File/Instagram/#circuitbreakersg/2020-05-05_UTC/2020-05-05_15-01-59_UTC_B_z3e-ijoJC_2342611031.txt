❤️This 5-min meditation can help children(5 and above), parents, teachers and caregivers with the opportunity to tune in to their bodies and offer gratitude to their incredible parts of the system that can be easily taken for granted. Timestamp: * Skip intro and go straight to meditation: 1.00 ❤️The Gratitude Meditation not only keeps your mind and body functioning at their best, but it also promotes feelings of calm, relaxation and happiness. COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting many aspects of children’s lives. Children thrive when their basic needs are met, and when family and community connections are stable and nurturing. ❤️Gratitude is a wonderful thing. It raises the human mind to great heights. Those that feel gratitude have the energy to create great things and can live in the positive expectation of good things to come. Positive Focus is committed to providing physical, emotional and psychological support to all families who are seeking to help their children at a critical time like this. ❤️I'll be creating more videos from home this month to help parents and teachers support their children/students with bite-sized practical and positive tools to feel empowered throughout the day. ✅Do drop me an email to has@positivefocus.com.sg or PM me if you would like to suggest a topic. ✅Follow up to receive more Practical Parenting / Teaching Tips. ❤️In the meantime, take positive actions to develop daily mindful habits! A one-minute conscious break every hour can help children and adults keep calm and carry on in uncertain times.
