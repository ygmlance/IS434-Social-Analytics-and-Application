Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Hey, Titus, this is like me being in upper or business class on the plane." "Yes, and I get the spacious first class seat on the lower deck." "Titus, why must you always insist on having the upper hand." "No, Vanilla, I never have the upper hand as I have paws." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
