Anyone’s bio-clock also completely messed up? 🥵Omg I completely lost it some weeks ago when I felt so overwhelmed by Momo that I turned into a monster and made him face the wall and yelled at him for not sleeping. 🤯
His schedule is now all over the place again, skipping naps, waking late, or sometimes taking naps and ending up sleeping near midnight. So difficult to put him on any kind of schedule as we were still trying to figure out our own. 
He would insist I sleep with him, then make me sleep in an awkward position so he can access my boobs, then toss and turn nonstop till i was so physically uncomfortable and kept drifting to sleep and getting woken by him. 
Eventually I went to my room and just tried to sleep while he climbed all over me like an obstacle course. He eventually crashed into my face and it hurt dammit so I just raged at him. He started crying for Daddy and I said No Daddy!! @zolalfredo was out for a jog so I called him and was such a crying wreck he thought my water broke or some accident happened 😓 
Just wanted to put this out here to remember how #circuitbreakersg can be overwhelming at times, and mums you are not alone ok!! 🥺
