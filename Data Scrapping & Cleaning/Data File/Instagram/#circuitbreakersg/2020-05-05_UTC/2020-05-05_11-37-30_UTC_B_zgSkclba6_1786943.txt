Enjoy both the rich taste of coffee with the bitter-sweet fragrance of matcha at the same time with this drink! ⁣

For the matcha cream, simply add matcha powder and a drop of vanilla essence to whipping cream and whip away until it forms a thicker-than-water consistency. Don't overwhip if not it'll end up like whipped cream. More matcha powder is recommended for those who love matcha, but I think not too much is good as well as it keeps the entire drink balanced. I don't use measuring spoons, but I think it was around 1-2 tsp of matcha powder for roughly 100ml of whipping cream.⁣

Drink directly without mixing!
