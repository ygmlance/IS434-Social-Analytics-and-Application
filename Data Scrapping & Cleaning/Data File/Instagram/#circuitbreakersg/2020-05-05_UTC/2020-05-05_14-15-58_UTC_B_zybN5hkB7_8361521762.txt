Today we will move to Singapore and discuss the ‘circuit-breaker measure’. Before the pandemic, Singapore is branded to be the best nation in providing healthcare service. The public-private partnership system worths mention at some point. .
The Lion City is now at sixes and sevens as they are facing a rapid outbreak of Covid-19 in the migrant workers dormitory. They are trying to leave no stone unturned and testing as many people as possible.
.
The policies are as follows: 
1. Stay at home as much as possible, go out alone if you need to
2. Controlled access at areas susceptible to crowding, e.g. markets
3. Closure of more work premises and tighter workplace measures
4. Additional safeguards for workplaces that remain open
5. Increased enforcement at work premises
.
Those drastic measures cost an arm and leg in the economy. However, you can’t make an omelette without breaking some eggs. We have to tighten social distancing measures and introduce universal masking to contain the spread of virus. .
Together, we fight the virus.
