Glow with us weekly on @yumiactive IG Live during circuit breaker period! 
This Sat 9th May 10am, join us for a 40 mins introductory barre class led by Vanessa Tan @vanessatlx from Barre Lab (@barrelab._ ). Barre is for all ages (yes get your kids to join you too!), backgrounds and levels of fitness. It is a workout that combines ballet-inspired movements, with elements of yoga and pilates. You can expect a low impact workout (but with considerable intensity!) that focuses on small, controlled movements targeting specific body parts.

Vanessa’s @vanessatlx passion for dance led her to pursue a career as a dance educator and barre instructor. She is a firm believer of the benefits of Barre as she finds the conditioning the workout gives to be especially helpful in posture and flexibility, and will help you to achieve long lean muscles. 
For this session, you will need your mat, 1 x chair (to replace barre stand) and 2 x dumbbells (0.5 - 1kg) OR 2 x water bottles filled with 500ml water each as dumbbells’ substitute. Wear your comfy activewear, have a towel and water for the session. Tag your friends who’ll be interested here!

No registration is needed, just tune in to @yumiactive IG Live at stipulated date/time and workout together! 
See you live!
