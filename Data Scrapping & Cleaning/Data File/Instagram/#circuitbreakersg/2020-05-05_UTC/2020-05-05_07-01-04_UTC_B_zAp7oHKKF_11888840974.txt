So glad that i managed to try this Malacca Seafood Cheese Bee Hoon by @penangculturesg before the circuit breaker measures started.
.
It was really yummy. Imagine the bee hoon soaked up in the gravy with the umami goodness contributed by the seafood and creaminess from the cheese ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ I'm craving it as I'm writing this!
.
Try it for yourself! @penangculturesg is available for takeaway at all their outlets as well as islandwide delivery for this circuit breaker period. You can also check out this site www.penangculture.oddle.me for delivery!
