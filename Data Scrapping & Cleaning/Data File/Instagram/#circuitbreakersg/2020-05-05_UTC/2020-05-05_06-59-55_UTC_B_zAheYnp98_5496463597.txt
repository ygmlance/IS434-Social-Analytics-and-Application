I made some guacamole, baked a pizza and played with puff pastry sheet for the first time! Experimenting with the puff pastry sheet and made some puff pastry twists and a mini mushroom pie. The kids were happy... it's a happy meal indeed! The weather's so hot and I ended up drinking the apple cider that I bought before CNY but left untouched in the fridge for the longest time.
