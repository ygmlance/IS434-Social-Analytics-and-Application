Dinner this evening, was a bowl of steamed rice, accompanied by stir-fried Garlic Stems with Lard and Superior Light Soya Sauce and a Pork Rib and White Radish Kimchi Stew. Very tasty, and very satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #stirfriedgarlicstems #porkribkimchistew #homecooking #homecookedmeals #homecookeddinner #stayathome #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
