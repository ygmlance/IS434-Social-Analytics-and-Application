Taking a break from my never ending work. Who agrees that working from home is definitively more stressful? .

#throwback to last evening when I’ve never been so harried in my cooking to complete everything in 20 mins flat including steaming the fish while multi-tasking to settle some impromptu work crisis on hand. Threw together a quick meal of beef bulgogi from leftover meat, steamed eggplant spiced with sautéed ginger n garlic n of cos, chilli padi - so good! N then steamed fish thanks to my warm neighbours who gifted me some fresh seafood. Sharing the love with my neighbours 😀.

I pay tribute to all working mothers though I’m not one but through this CB (lockdown), i can imagine the stress to care for the family plus work commitments can be utterly overwhelming. I’m already hoping this cb would end soon otherwise I’ll go ballistic. Ok, enough of my rant. I need a good neat drink after this. .

That said, I think this CB’s rekindled my interest in cooking Cos I think it’s akin to the arts but the harnessing of the senses’re more acute. N above all, cooking enables u to deliver the best in your craft - something I always hold strongly to. 
Ps. For everyone’s info, I failed home econs in school with a f9 grade (no hope! I can’t sew Nor cook to save my life then) cos I’ve always been a math n science student. But hey! I can cook now so can you! Haha .
