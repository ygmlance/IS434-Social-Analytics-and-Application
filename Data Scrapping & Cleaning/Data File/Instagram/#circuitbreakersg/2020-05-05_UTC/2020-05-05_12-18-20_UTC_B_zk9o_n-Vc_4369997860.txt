Just about a year ago travelling around Southern Africa. One of the highlights was the helicopter ride around #CapeTown when we were in #SouthAfrica. We have posted a guide if things to do in Cape Town when #wewilltravelagain 🇿🇦 Also showing you a moment @thuymi captured of me while being excited to open an awesome press package from @lovecapetown. Super grateful that our work on @adventurefaktory is inspiring people to travel and tourism brands to work with people like us to encourage the travel industry. Don’t cancel your trips guys, try to postpone them if possible 🙏🏽 ⚡️ #AdventureFaktoryInAfrica
