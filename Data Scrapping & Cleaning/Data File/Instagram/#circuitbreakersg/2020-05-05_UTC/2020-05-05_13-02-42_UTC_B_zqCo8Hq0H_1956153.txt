Happy 🇯🇵 day! We’re celebrating a diff ethnicity or culture every day, and its just been silly + helps decide what food to order in + makes it fun for the kids to learn a lil too 🎌🎌🎌 so we had chirashi, found japan on our globes, watched a hello kitty show, and randomly said arigato. 🍙🍥🍣 Halfway through the ultimate parenting challenge, guys! 💪🏼💪🏼💋 #lucxthea #circuitbreakersg
