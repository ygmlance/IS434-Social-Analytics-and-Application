School holiday officially starts today!‚Å£
‚Å£
But this lass is not slacking the least bit after her last #hbl and #sls session yesterday. Because all, if not most, of her usual face-to-face tuition classes have been cancelled, she's worried about catching up with the school curriculum (especially Science where PSLE covers topics taught from P3 onwards), we signed her up for @tenopy.sg at her request.‚Å£
‚Å£
@Tenopy.sg specializes in Live Online Tutoring for primary and secondary school students from the comfort of home, conducted by top educators in the industry. I sat in one of the classes Bel had and thought the real-time, live guidance by her tutor was very engaging and clear. From my perspective, I really liked how the curriculum is designed by a former Assistant Dean of NIE to foster the critical thinking skills of students, and the Parents Weekly Report provided after lessons for us to monitor Bel‚Äôs progress. These skills-based reports and qualitative feedback are very practical.‚Å£
‚Å£
I later asked Bel what she liked about Tenopy‚Äôs online classes and here's what she said:‚Å£
- There are group and voice chats which allow her to ask questions or contribute during the lessons‚Å£
- Polls and quizzes conducted during lessons are fun ‚Å£
- Homework can be submitted online for tutors to mark and grade‚Å£
- All lessons attended are recorded so she can replay them if she missed any lessons, or for revisiting a certain topic‚Å£
‚Å£
Seeing is believing so I'd like to invite you and your child to join a COMPLIMENTARY trial class at ‚Å£
