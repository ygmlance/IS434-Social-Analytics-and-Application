I miss cycling.⁠
⁠
My husband would be gleeful to hear that because he complains that I don't like cycling enough.⁠
⁠
I miss going out as a family, riding to the mall, or to breakfast. It's family time in the sun, which we haven't had in a long time because of the Circuit Breaker.⁠
⁠
There's just something about being the sun, feeling the heat on my skin, and the wind in my hair.⁠
⁠
I just miss going out of the house and entertaining the kids with physical activities.⁠
⁠
I can't wait to do that again when the restrictions are slowly lifted.⁠
⁠
What are the things that you miss most during this Circuit Breaker? What are you looking forward to do most when you can go out again?⁠
