Mini Popiah for snack 
I had seen how my mom and my aunt made this when I was younger and I loved eating it piping hot ! It’s my first time trying to make everything on my own n I just replicate what I had remembered. Glad that it was a success! #tastegreattoo🙌🏻🥰 Couldn’t get turnip this morn so I decided to use cabbage (cos I hv lots in my fridge )and carrots instead. Takes me 10 mins to cut n fry the veg this morn. 5min to wrap it ! N 5 min to deep fry it ! #notmessy #allwentwell
