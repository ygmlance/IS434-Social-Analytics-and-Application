【Recipe】Tried two new recipes this evening😋 Both spicy dishes but so good! 🤗 
Spicy ginger wings which are oven roasted and then generously coated with that homemade finger-licking good hot sauce.

Thai style spicy Minced pork spaghetti noodles. Adapted from the Thai dish Pad Kra Pao but using spaghetti instead of serving it with steam rice. #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
Catch me cooking the dishes in my IGS. 
Sharing the recipe for the pasta. #honeybeecooksspicythaimincedporkpasta

Spice paste
2 shallots, peeled
4 garlic cloves, peeled

150g pasta, boiled till al dente

Seasoning
1 tbsp fish sauce 
1 tbsp dark soy sauce 
1 tsp sugar

2) Add marinated minced pork and break up the meat as you sauté.
