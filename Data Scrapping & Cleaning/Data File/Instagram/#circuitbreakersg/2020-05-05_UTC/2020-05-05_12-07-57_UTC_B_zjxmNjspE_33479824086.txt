Only thing you need is a chair and a resistance band. The goal is to go slow and controlled , squeeze each rep as hard as you can. This is the perfect time to create that mind muscle connection.⁣
⁣
So NO excuses, let’s get it 🔥⁣
⁣
The work 👇⁣
⁣
Triple set 1⁣
✖️Alt Shoulder press⁣
3 x 12 each ⁣
✖️chest press ⁣
3 x 12 ⁣
✖️horizontale row ⁣
3 x 12⁣
⁣
Superset 2⁣
✖️Reverse fly⁣
3 x 12⁣
✖️lateral raises ⁣
3 x 12 each ⁣
⁣
Superset 3⁣
✖️Seated bicep curls ⁣
3 x 12⁣
✖️ Tricep extension ⁣

✖️seated inner bicep curls ⁣

⁣
⁣
👉 hit super set 1 back to back with minimal rest in between the 2 exercises. Once you’ve performed each exercise once over , take 30 rest  and then repeat the superset 2 more times. Then go to superset 2 and do the same👌⁣⁣
