Weâ€™re all embarking on an unfamiliar new journey. Who would have thought that we will one day operate a restaurant with zero dine in guests?  That we would need to re-engineer our menu for takeout only?
.
We are thankful that we are able to continue to work with our talents.  Although we are offering takeout on Fri, Sat and Sun only, it gives our team some sort of routine and focus.
.
Most of all, we are extremely grateful that we can continue to delight our guests at home.  We do miss interacting with our guests and the occasional banter. Many of of our guests have texted us encouraging messages which we appreciate.
.
This month we continue our charity takeout raising funds for @healthservesg who looks after migrant workers.  We hope you will join us in supporting this worthy cause. For details, please see link in our bio.
