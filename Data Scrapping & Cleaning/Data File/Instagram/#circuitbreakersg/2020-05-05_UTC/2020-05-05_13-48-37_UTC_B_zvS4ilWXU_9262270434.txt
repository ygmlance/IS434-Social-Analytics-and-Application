Angel's Billabong 📍Nusa Penida ,Indonesia
..
A beautiful pool made by nature surrounded by limestone cliffs. 
It is a natural rock lagoon with beautiful scenic seascape located in the shore that offer amazing view and scenery.
..
You can also say the most instagrammable natural pool in the world and quite unique but be careful.
..
You can take a lot of stunning panoramic photos.
..
Nusa Penida is around 2 hours from bali, with a lot of awesome things to do.. and also offers breath-taking viewpoints and amazing beaches. Roads are not that great in this area..
..
There are lots of day tours from Bali, if you would like to explore Nusa Penida.
..
I would definitely recommend to add this place in your bali itinerary.
