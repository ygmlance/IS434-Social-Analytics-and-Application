“Cookie Dough Brownies”
It started off as a horrible mistake while attempting to make the perfect chocolate chip cookies. I accidentally added in 4 eggs instead of 2 eggs as called from the recipe. The consistency was completely off when I was done with the dough. Added more flour and baking powder+soda to make it into a cake like texture. And woohoo 🎉 ⠀
It turned out pretty amazing after all 👏
