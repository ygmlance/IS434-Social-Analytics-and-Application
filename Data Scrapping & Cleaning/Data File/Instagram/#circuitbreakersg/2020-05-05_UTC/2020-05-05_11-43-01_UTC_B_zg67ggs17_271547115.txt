🌟REST DAY🌟⁣
⁣
I used to neglect rest days, and thought I was slacking and not doing enough if I didn’t workout that day or didn’t hit my 10k steps a day. And not gonna lie, I’m still not the best when it comes to listening to my body, sometimes I just push myself to workout to “feel better”, to feel like I’ve “achieved” something. ⁣
BUT recently with the COVID lockdown, it’s helped me to slow down, be okay with that, and appreciate that I don’t need to workout 2/3 times a day or even Everyday to feel good. And it’s helping me slowly be more intune with how my body is really feeling. ⁣

Sooooo I Guess the lockdown isn’t THAT bad after all, plus LOOK AT THIS VIEWWW! Would never get this in the gym!! 😍⁣

💫everyone, take a day off if you’re tired or want to, it’s okay to slow down and do f all sometimes! Refuel your body, eat some yummy food, put NETFLIX on and enjoy the day off, your body isn’t going to change/your progress isn’t gonna stop/you’re not slacking/ or whatever you feel, just because you took 24hours off 💫
