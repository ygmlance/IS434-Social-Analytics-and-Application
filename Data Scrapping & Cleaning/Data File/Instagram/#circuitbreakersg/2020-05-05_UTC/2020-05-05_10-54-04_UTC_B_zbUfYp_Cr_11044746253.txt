Made ingot-shaped wonton again. Can fry or boil, dry or soup, with special gravy or not, up to one’s preference. I usually rotate or when I’m lazy, just boil and run some garlic oil and eat! 😂 Ketua Rumah tried to help this time.. even though the one he made looked quite obscene.. macam “anal crack” and he asked why like that?  I don’t know man, I taught you what I know and the result is how you interpret it. That’s why not all students are the same despite being taught by the same teacher😂
Btw, today’s infected number has dropped to 30, but please be reminded it’s the result of past swab test done few weeks ago. The new cases during loosen MCO is not out yet.. And, apparently the Pasar Borong cluster was related to a member who participated in Tabligh gathering.. so again, stay away from the crowd n wet market 💯❤️
