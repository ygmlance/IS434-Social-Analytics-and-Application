Today, we celebrate your life. To the one who is consistently supportive of everything I pursue in life, to the one who is always gonna be there even if you screw up so many times and to the man after God’s heart. My Papa is not a very outspoken and extroverted soul, he always stays calm and quiet and he rarely opens up to people and usually seen as stern and serious. But I’m grateful I get to experience the crazy side my dad has, although sometimes, I wish it wasn’t as crazy and ‘kulit’ ♡ ♡ ♡
I pray that you may have more birthdays to come and that you will keep fit and healthy. Happy Quarantine Birthday, Paps. You are the real MVP! Thank you for being a great role model and I could only pray the guy I get to spend the rest of my life with can be at least half as good-hearted and loving as you are. Thank you for everything. We love you, Papa! Thor is my fave but he ain’t got nothing on my dad and with all the sacrifices he has done for the family! You are my hero! ❤️
