Two push up tips for you 💪🏼👇🏼
⁣
With home workouts becoming all the rage, the push up has become a staple in many fitness regimes. If you are new to push ups, or haven't been doing them often, here are two tips that may help you along: ⁣
⁣
𝟭. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀. In the first video I demonstrate the scapular push up. With elbows locked - pardon my freaky-looking, hyper-extended ones - push into the ground from your shoulders, until your back begins to round. You can hold this position, or perform repetitions with momentary pauses at the top of each rep.
⁣
If you look closely at the first video, you can see my shoulder blade moving under my shirt. Some of you may exhibit the "collapsed" scapular position that you see in between my reps when you perform the push up. In other words, your shoulder blades "wing", or jut out, during the exercise. This is a sign of weak scapular protraction, which can lead to injury at worst, and sub-optimal training outcomes at best. ⁣
⁣
But not to worry; practising the drill here will strengthen the serratus anterior - the muscle connecting your shoulder blades to your ribs - which is responsible for scapular protraction. When this muscle is functioning well, you will have a strong shoulder position during your push ups without the need for a deliberate effort to protract your shoulder blades. ⁣
⁣
𝟮. 𝗚𝗿𝗶𝗽 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗿. In the second video, I demonstrate my hand position during the push up. While it is perfectly fine to perform the exercise with extended fingers, I find that "gripping" the floor by flexing their middle joints facilitates greater strength output. ⁣
⁣
What is most important in developing overall, full-body strength and athleticism is the ability to use as many parts of the body as possible in your movement. So grip that floor and feel the force!
⁣
Another side benefit of gripping the floor: the handstand is also made easier with this hand and finger posture. So for those of you working on your inversions, this could help you along on your handbalancing journey.
⁣
Have fun, and may the floor be with you! 🤣
