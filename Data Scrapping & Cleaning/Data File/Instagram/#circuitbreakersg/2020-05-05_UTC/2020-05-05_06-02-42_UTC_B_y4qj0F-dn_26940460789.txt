When our Speaker of Parliament (former Brigadier general), reminds us to do our daily workouts. 🤦🏻‍♀️😝 Singaporean guys must be stressed. Sir, at 51, will surely pass the annual IPPT anytime hands down.

Sir! I prefer to climb stairs, 30-40 storeys, up and down (1,3,5 in a week) 😬But I miss my 40 laps twice weekly swims. When will we open up the pools again..? #nationalfitnessinstructor
