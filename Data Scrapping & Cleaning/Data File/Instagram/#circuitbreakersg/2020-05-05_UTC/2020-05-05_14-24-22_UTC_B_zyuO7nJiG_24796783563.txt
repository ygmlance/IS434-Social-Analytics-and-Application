Working out at home over weeks can get monotonous. But I have realised that goal setting can make it interesting. Doesn’t have to be a long term goal. Give yourself a daily goal, or a weekly challenge. Short term goals will give you better results and make your day more productive. 👍🏼🏋🏻‍♀️#CircuitBreakerSg .
