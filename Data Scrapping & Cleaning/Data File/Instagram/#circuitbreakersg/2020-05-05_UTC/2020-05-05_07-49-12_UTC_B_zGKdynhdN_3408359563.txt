Day 29 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg - 5 Msy 2020 - Made an #easypeasy #quicklunch #nofilter of #dumplingsoup with the not very good #leftover #dumplings from yesterday just using some #homemade vegetable stock, some water, a chicken stock cube, a carrot and some seasoning. Uninspiring but still food. 😁 #stayhomewithascott #homecooking
