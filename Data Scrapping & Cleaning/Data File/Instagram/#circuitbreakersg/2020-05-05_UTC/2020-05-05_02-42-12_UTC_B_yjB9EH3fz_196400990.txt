Brunch today, was another attempt at Char Kway Teow! This time, i didnâ€™t use enough chilli sauce, and i almost forgot to put the eggs in, only adding them in a later stage...!!! Nonetheless, it still tasted good. ðŸ˜‹ #charkwayteow #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #stayathome #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
