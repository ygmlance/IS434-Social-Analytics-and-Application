The Long Walk is a beautiful tree-lined avenue that runs between Windsor Castle and Windsor Great Park, a 5,000 acres Royal Park.

I visited this beautiful park on a day trip from London in April last year.

I really enjoyed my visit here! The air was fresh and crisp, and the surrounding greenery was lush and calming.

I even got to see a line of horse carriages travelling towards Windsor Castle! That was a really cool sight for a city dweller like me.
