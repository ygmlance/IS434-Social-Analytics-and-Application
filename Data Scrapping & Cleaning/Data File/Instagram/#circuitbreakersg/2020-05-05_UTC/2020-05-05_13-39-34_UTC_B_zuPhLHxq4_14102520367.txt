MY FACE IS FULL OF BUBBLES!!! 😏

Recently the weather is really warm, staying at home with only sunblock, my skin becomes more oily and blackheads are growing at a rapid rate too!

Sharing with you my masking moment with Ellure Tomato Resonace Graphene Bubble Mask while I'm on my phone. The bubbles are bubbling on my face and it deeply cleanse my skin. The appearance of my blackheads reduced slightly and my skin also smoothen & brighten up.
.
I tried to use the mask for a period of time, 2 times a week. My oily sensitive skin feels fresher and detoxified! Each time I use, it feels rejuvenated as if I had done an oxygen facial treatment in a salon.

This mask contains:
🔴 Tomato, a good source of vitamin C and contains salicylic acid
🔴 Graphene penetrates deep into skin layers to activate skin cells
.
