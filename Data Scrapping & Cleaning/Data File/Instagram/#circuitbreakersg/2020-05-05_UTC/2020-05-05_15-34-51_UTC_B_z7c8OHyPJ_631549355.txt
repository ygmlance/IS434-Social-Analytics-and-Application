°•○●TWICE BAKED POTATOES ●○•°
I’ve learned over the years that all baked potatoes are not created equal. I’ve had baked potatoes that knocked my socks off and baked potatoes that left something to be desired. These stuffed baked potatoes are definitely the former.
TWICE BAKED potatoes are an easy preparation, and they can make any meal extra-special. 
The baked potatoes are scooped out, mashed with minced beef, Mushroom and diced vegetables . The mashed potatoes are returned to the potato shells and baked with a generous topping of shredded cheese.
