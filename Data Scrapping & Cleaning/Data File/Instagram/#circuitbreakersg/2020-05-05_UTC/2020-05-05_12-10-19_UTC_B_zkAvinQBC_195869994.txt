Yanzhi Handmade soap, Si Sheng Yan (焱芝手工皂, 四聲焱) is locally made in #Taiwan.
🌿 
Yurong Essence Liquid Soap is kind of interesting! This chemical-free liquid soap is completely frozen, thus, the coconut oil content solidifies when it is cold. The content must be heated up in warm water to soften it first (soak the whole bottle into a sink of warm water). Watch the video 👀 🌿 
Divide into smaller bottles and dilute to the desired consistency you want! It's can more economical this way, when 1 bottle can actually becomes 2!!
🌿 
I read that this natural soap is perfect for people with sensitive skin and skin disorder such as  #eczema, #insectbites, #psorisis and #Skininflammation to name a few. It helps to soothe irritated skin by applying as a paste on the sting or wound.
🌿 
Vera had some rash outbreak behind her knees recently. I applied it as a paste for a while before I washed off during shower. The rough patches have now gradually smoothen up after using for two weeks.
🌿 
It is suitable for all skin types and is multi-functional. It works as shampoo, shower gel and I used it to wash my face to get rid of the sebum. With anti-bacterial properties, you can also make in as a handwash during this pandemic, practise good hygiene by frequent washing of hands when you are back from outdoors.
