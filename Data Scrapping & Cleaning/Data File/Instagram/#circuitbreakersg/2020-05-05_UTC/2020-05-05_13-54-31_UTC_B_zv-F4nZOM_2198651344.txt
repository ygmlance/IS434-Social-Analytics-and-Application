[#TheHedgehogAtHome] And so we tried another value-for-money bento, the "S$10 Meal in a Box" from @GrandHyattSing. He had the Australian Grass-fed 220gm Beef Cheese Burger 🍔, while I had Solanki’s Butter Chicken 🐔. Really loved my butter chicken, as it was so flavourful! We also ordered the Slow-braised Australian Grass-fed Beef Rendang 🥩, and the beef was surprisingly tender.
.
There are 17 varieties to choose from, crowd-favourites specially curated from the hotel's various restaurants. Other choices include the Heura Plant-based Chicken Green Curry, Sambal Marinated Sustainable Barramundi Fillet, Beyond Meat Beef Burger etc. Halal options are available too.

Hope I am giving you some ideas for this Thursday's Vesak Day break and Mother's Day weekend! Swipe ⬅️ for more pics.
