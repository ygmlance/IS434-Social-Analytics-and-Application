Needing a break from cooking tonight, we ventured out to 'tapao' (takeaway) from our favourite lechon peeps @lechonrepublicsg... Day 29's dinner menu was the usual awesome chopped lechon and something I have not ordered before, pansit bihon which is very similar to our local Singapore fried beehoon (vermicelli) but with a whole 'chapalang' (colloquial local slang for a random mixture of various elements) of meat and veggies... A fantastic way to end "circuit breaker" day 29! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
