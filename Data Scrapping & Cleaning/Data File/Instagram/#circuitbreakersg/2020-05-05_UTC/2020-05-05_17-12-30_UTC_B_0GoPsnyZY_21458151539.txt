Brownies, this time a HUGE success! thank God because this is my husband's birthday cake. Birthday falls within circuit breaker period no problem, an oven and an awesome recipe, we got our birthday cake under an hour! This is half the pan, i don't have a plate large enough to place the entire slab. This brownie is very moist, max fudgy and very chocolatey. Again, I reduced sugar by 1/3, added extra cocoa powder, slightly more pink salt & a little espresso powder to heighten the chocolate flavour. Major ðŸ˜‹
