✴️A chiropractic adjustment is a gentle and specific force thrusting in a specific direction to restore structural alignment or to improve joint function.

In layman's term, we are trying to correct the misalignment of the joint to restore its motion and allow it to function normally in relation to all the structures around it e.g. Nerves, muscles, ligament etc.

A lot of patients have texted me to say they miss the adjustments, they can wait to get adjustment again. I can't wait to go back into the office and start serving them again. See you all in June!
