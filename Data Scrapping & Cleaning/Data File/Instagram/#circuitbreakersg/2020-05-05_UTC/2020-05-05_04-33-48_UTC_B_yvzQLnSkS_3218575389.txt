3 years old and a sensitive soul, our little man voices his big feelings and I love it. He has displayed feelings of compassion and empathy (when mama cries, he sayangs and tickles me so I’d laugh again), frustration and loss (when his toy train derails from the track or when his toy car collection doesn’t form a perfectly straight line), joy and mischief (laughing along when everyone laughs and tickles us when we stop) etc.
I wasn’t brought up to express my feelings and the expectation was to absorb any hurt and pain, get over it and be healed in 24 hours. It was mind-blowing the first time I was asked how I felt. It took years to be able to articulate hurt and I think this is the norm in Asian culture.
Of course, not ideal when he uses it during meals or bedtime, but I’m not complaining, yet. 🥰❤️
