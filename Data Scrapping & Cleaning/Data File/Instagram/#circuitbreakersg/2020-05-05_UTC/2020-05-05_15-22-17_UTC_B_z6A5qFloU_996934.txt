Q: As Christians, do we serve others altruistically despite our own poverty, or charitably out of our immense abundance?
.
.
Possibly a false dichotomy, but perhaps we rarely think of the abundance we have because of #justificationbyfaithalone and #gracealone:
.
“Justification by faith keeps us from the need for self-justification, or the need always to be noticed and praised by others. As such, it is a powerful remedy to self-delusion and despair. If I am always dependent upon the assessment of others for approval...chances are I will put my energies into work that will win the most approval and applause. In so doing, I will be failing to do the real work of pastoring, and even what real work of pastoring I do will be done from improper motives. Justification by faith will provide me with the glue that will enable me to stick to my real tasks, seeking the approval of the One who really counts.” (Peter Brain, “Going the Distance”)
.

“Grace transcends love... It is love which...has an unexhausted wealth of kindness. Grace transcends mercy. Mercy forgives sin, and rescues the sinner from eternal darkness and death. But grace floods with affection the sinner who has deserved anger and resentment, trusts penitent treachery with a confidence that could not have been merited by ages of incorruptible fidelity, confers on a race which had been in revolt honours which no loyalty could have purchased, on the sinful joy beyond the desert of saintliness.” (Thomas Brooks, “Works”).
