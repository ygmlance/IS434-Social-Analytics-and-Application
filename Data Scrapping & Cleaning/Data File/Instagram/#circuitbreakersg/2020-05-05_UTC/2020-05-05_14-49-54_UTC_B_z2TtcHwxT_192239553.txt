Yet another intense day and quite washed out by day end
.
Since late Jan, virus related work has been non stop, scaling things up and down, fixing broken parts that showed up in a crisis and fixing more broken parts to come. These have worn me down
.
Havenâ€™t had time to do zoom Sunday school lessons and for many weeks counted on the goodwill of parents to tell the stories to their kids
.
Decided to work on something different this Sunday and sending a care package to the kids tomorrow
.
Looking forward to their expressions when they open their mail!
.
Will also present my requests to God, among them to have more strength, patience, time and for His grace to prune me in this wintry season, ready to blossom when spring arrives!
