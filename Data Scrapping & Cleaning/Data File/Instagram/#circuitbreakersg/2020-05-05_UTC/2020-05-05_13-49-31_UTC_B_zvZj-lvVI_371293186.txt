Circuit Breaker Day 28 & 29 - 28 ~ Back to basic "simplest" way of cooking for lunch after a few richly flavoured meals in last few days. Soup stock made from using Sakura chicken bones & skinless chicken back (can be bought at NTUC Finest or X-tra with counters selling whole or all parts of Sukura chicken) prepared last week with pressure cooker while working. Another "protein loaded" meal of Poached Chicken & Abalone Noodles Soup ~ very simple meal.
29 ~  Japanese Chicken Vegetable Stew - 1/2 Sakura Junior Chicken (remove skin), 1 pack of mushrooms, 1 carrot (cut triangular big chunks), 1 clove of garlic, half a small yellow onion cut into halves , 6 pieces of Kombu from Seoul (measuring about 5 X 2cm), 3-4 slices of ginger. Conditments ~ 1 tbs low sodium soy sauce, 1.5 tbs organic white miso paste, 2 tsp brown sugar (my preference), 1 tbs Mirin (Japanese rice wine), water just enough to cover 3/4 of the ingredients. Add 1 tbs of grapeseed oil to stir fry yellow onions & mushrooms in pressure cooker few minutes, add in chicken, carrots to cook in pressure cooker for 20 minutes & off flame for pressure to release. Thicken sauce with a little bit of corn starch. Serve with rice is good but I am a riceless person, so my this recipe is an adjusted flavoured version. Day 30...decided to buy Popeye fried chicken, don't wanna cook for a day! #estheryykitchen #cookinghobbyist #cookinggram #asianfood #japanesefood #miso #foodstagram #homecookedmeal #eatstargram #eatwithme #healthyfood #lowcalories #lowfats #noodlegram #noodlesoup #dinnergram #everythinghomemade #eathealthy #simpledinner #circuitbreakersg #thermalpot #easycooking #汤面 #日菜 #鸡汤面
