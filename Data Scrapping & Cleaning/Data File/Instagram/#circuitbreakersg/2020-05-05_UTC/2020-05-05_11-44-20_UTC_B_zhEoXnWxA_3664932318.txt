What do we do on our off day? We support our friends of course!

Here's a shoutout to @crossingscafe at Waterloo Street, a #catholic #socialenterprise which our friend @janch85 is involved in. Whenever you are not eating our Fajitas, we strongly recommend their Franciscan Burger and Truffle Mac'n'Cheese!

This #circuitbreakersg has taught us that #resilience and #solidarity doesn't just come from the government, but exists in its truest form amongst friends, regular customers, and the community in general. We are so grateful for the many beautiful people we met since we started home deliveries, and the many friends who continuously support us. Let's continue to share the love!
