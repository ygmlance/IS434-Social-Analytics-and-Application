ACTIVITY 💡: Farm Sensory Tray

A simple sensory tray with green beans, barley, corn kernels, yellow paper strips and blue tissue paper with dried blue pea flowers to learn about farm animals 🐐🐑🐖🐕🐈🐄🐎 Starting our first ever May school holidays slow and easy - 👧🏻S3 matched the animals to the cards with ease, and briefly got the animals to “feed”; while 👦🏻J7 recalled the spelling of the names of the animals! And then it’s a lot of free play, running about, and reading!

I actually don’t keep track of which day of the #circuitbreakersg we are at. I’m only counting to the number of days we have left to spend these precious days of slowing down together. We are all going through a historic period - it’s something that one hopes will never happen again, yet it is all so timely to happen. Let’s continue to take time to reflect and restore, and remember to be intentional about self-care 💕
