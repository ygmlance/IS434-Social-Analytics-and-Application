Hubby decided to make claypot rice for lunch today! I would consider this as a healthier version with no "锅巴" 😆 but that's the shiok part isnt it? I would have to give him 👍. I cooked the healthier part of the meal - spinach soup 🤣🤣 #claypotrice #claypotchickenrice #spinachsoup #weekdaylunch #lunchsg #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #christiecancook🍽  #sgfood #sgfoodie #christie❤food
