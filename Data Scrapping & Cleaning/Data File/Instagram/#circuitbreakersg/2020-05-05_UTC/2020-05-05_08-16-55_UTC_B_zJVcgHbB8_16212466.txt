I've always love breaded Fish Fingers and I'm really glad to have found this recipe @recipe_tin that does not require firing up a pot of oil and just only using an oven. No oily mess, I didn't need a lot of time to prepare and it created a crunchy layer enveloping sweet-tasting fish meat. More importantly, it was delicious! 👍🏻😋😍 Recipe:
