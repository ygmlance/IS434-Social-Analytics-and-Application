I was initially a little worried that the boys would be snatching each otherâ€™s toys or quarreling over the smallest thing during this extended time of having each other as their only friend; but hey, itâ€™s all good! The boys are loving CB, oops I meant each other too much. They play together all day long, ask to take pics of them hugging, share precious boba fresh milk together, attend each other HBL lessons, and feed each other freshly bakes. ðŸ¤£ 
I did wonder how long this will last, but decided to relish in these precious moments instead. ðŸ˜Š  #preciousmoments #family #brothersforlife #siblings #circuitbreakersg #thankful #grateful #sgkids #sgmommies #sgmummies
