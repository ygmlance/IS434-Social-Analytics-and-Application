As much as we are indoors, it is important we get some “outdoors” as much as possible. Not only is it good to get some direct & indirect sunshine, but it’s also healing for the mind & soul.

#naturewalks and activities related to #nature are somewhat like a distant memory, but it doesn’t have to be if we can set aside time to talk about plants & flowers, and caring for them. One of S “jobs” around at home is to help papa with the plants at the balcony. Today’s chat was about the baby plants that have appeared in the pot.

Another little project is the avocado seeds and papa’s avocado orchard (in twenty years time 😅😅). Jokes aside, the huge seeds, in clear glass, allows us to observe the roots closely, and to have a greater investigation of the shoots when they appear.

S intends to have this as #showandtell #hbl in the near future #homebasedlearning on #zoom

The #piklertriangle has really come in handy too to keep her active. We’ve discovered a new #kids #kidsworkout videos on YouTube and she’s been trying them out enthusiastically 🥰
