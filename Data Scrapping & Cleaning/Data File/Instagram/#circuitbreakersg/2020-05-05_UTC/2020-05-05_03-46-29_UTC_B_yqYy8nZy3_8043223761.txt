[As requested, shared the recipe below!] It's the start of the school holidays!! So we kicked it off with steaming a cake using four simple ingredients.
âœ”Milo powder (1 cup)
âœ”Eggs (2 eggs)
âœ”Milk (1 tbsp)
âœ”Baking powder (1 tsp)

Mix all ingredients together with a whisk and steam for about 15 minutes. Check cake with a thin skewer, it's ready when it comes out clean!

The milo cake came out fluffy and moist! It's the easiest cake we have ever made. Let's share our stay-home holiday activities ok! Stay safe, stay healthy and stay occupied. ðŸ˜„
