Here are my #tuesdaythoughts 🤓

While #covid_19 itself is enough to drain us , so called quarantine social media goals #quarantinechallenge on fitness , cooking or creativity are adding to it . Just remember being at home does not necessarily mean luxury of time , though it certainly brings along huge burden of managing homes irrespective of gender . 
So don’t fall into trap of doing something you don’t enjoy and is not essential for living/well-being.  Do what makes #stayhomemovement easier for you.  Let’s be more considerate n do what helps uplift our spirits . 
I am enjoying yoga 🧘‍♀️, indoor photography 📸 n my own company for extended hours 😂 (weird?) 🙈! What’s your idea of surviving #socialdistancing ? #indiansinsingapore #singaporebeautyblogger #singaporelifestyle #indianlifestyleblogger #findyourhappiness #wearetogetherinthis #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #salutefrontlinersallovertheworld👩‍⚕️👮‍♂️👩‍🍳👨‍🌾👩‍🔬 #skincare #skincareroutine #beauty #tryandreviewsg #reconnectwithyourself
