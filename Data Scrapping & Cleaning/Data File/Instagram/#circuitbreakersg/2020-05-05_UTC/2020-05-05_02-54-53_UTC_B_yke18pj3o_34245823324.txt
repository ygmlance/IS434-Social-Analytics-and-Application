Sam Fishery Supplies is a seafood stall run by my aunt and uncle, based in Ghim Moh Market. They have received many requests to deliver their seafood especially during this #circuitbreaker period, so we decided to help them make their seafood available for you guys online. #Staysafe and #stayhome during this #circuitbreakersg and let us deliver fresh seafood to you! Less than a month to go!
