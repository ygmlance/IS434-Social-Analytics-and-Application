03/05/20 | CB Day 27 - It’s SUNDAY! We miss going to Sentosa for sand and water play so much! Lincoln said “I want to build castle, Mummy”. SURE, your wish is my command.

TA-DAH !! 👏 Make-shift sand pit for Lincoln and Linnaeus. Great sensory play for the both of them and it kept Lincoln occupied for almost 1.5hours! We had to drag him out for shower and nap.

Let’s pray for the Covid-19 situation to ease soon so we can go to the Zoo, Sentosa, ECP for outdoor fun again! 4 weeks down, 4 more weeks to go! 💪
