DAY 29 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES

I had been craving this for way too long, and I just HAD to make it for myself. Went through a couple of recipes on the net. Most said Huatiao wine or Shaoxing wine. Hard to go hunting for those during CB. So asked my friend, and she suggested I substitute it with regular wine or Japanese Sake. I had some cooking wine at home, so decided to use that. Results were good, I am so content tonight. I will sleep well 😉😁 Here is what I did...
600g of pork belly, or any chicken, or beef, cut into bite size pieces
Star anise - 3 to 4
Dry red chilli - 3-4
Bay leaf - 3-4
Sugar- 1.5 tsp
Soy sauce dark -1tbsp
Soy sauce light - 1 tbsp
Ginger- 1" by 1" inch piece, sliced
Cooking wine - 2tbsp

In a pan, sear the pieces of meat on high heat. If using porl, do not put oil, the meat has enough in it. Keep stirring. When it begins to become brown, add the sugar. Stir for a min. Add the star anise, bay leaf, chilli and ginger. Fry for  4-5 min. 
Now transfer the contents to another heavy bottomed pan, leaving all the rendered fat behind. Add the soy sauces & cooking wine, add water and cook fir 40-50 min, till the meat is tender, and sauce is dry.
Garnish with toasted sesame & finely chopped chinese celery. 
Had it with some broth and chinese tea 🤷‍♀️
I love my Asian meals. Anyone else who likes Chinese food? I mean the real Chinese food, not Indo-chinese 😉
