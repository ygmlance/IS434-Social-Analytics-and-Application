The hawker culture of uncles and aunties who sell ice cream from push carts is a dwindling trade... Whenever I head to Sim Lim Tower, I always make it a point to visit the ice cream uncle for my slab of raspberry ice cream "kiap-ed" between, no not bread but two wafer biccies... I'm always sad when uncle tells me he's sold out because raspberry ripple is a popular flavour... A thank you to all the uncles and aunties who brave the hot sun and sometimes rainy weather to earn a living selling push cart ice cream...
Bringing a bit of rippling joy to "circuit breaker" day 29 by making some keto ice cream with my homemade jam as the ripple... Finished it up by adding huge dollops of jam onto the top of the ice cream!
I can't wait until the ice cream uncles and aunties are allowed to get back to their ice cream carts again... Sooooooo going out to buy a couple of raspberry ripple ice creams "kiap-ed" between wafers! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
