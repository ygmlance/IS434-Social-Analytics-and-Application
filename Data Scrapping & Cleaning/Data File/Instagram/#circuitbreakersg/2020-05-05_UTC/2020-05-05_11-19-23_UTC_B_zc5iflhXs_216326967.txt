Caught up (remotely) with old Lilac Saints band mate Desmond  @lilacsaintdrums to jam old Britpop fave, 'Tender'. Love the song for it's slack, lo-fi feel which suits the mood we're all in now. Also the lyrics "Come on, come on, get through it" is quite apt while we wait out this CB period. Blur fans will notice I got the lyrics to the last part wrong which made the song a little morbid - too bad I couldn't be arsed to re-record it ðŸ˜‚

Stay safe & well yâ€™all.
