Day 29 - Circuit Breaker Sg. Today is the end of circuit breaker if it's not been extended. Crazy early of the month at work 🥴💻💰. Sam built his own brachiosaurus 😆 with super long neck🤣. Managed to do night run 🏃‍♀️ important to destress. My five fingers shoes I think not going to make it, sad, sad 👟😫. And watched Wild Rice Supervision Drama Theatre in youtube at night 🇸🇬. Very Singaporean, 😆😄 it's good, funny & real 👍🌃 #covid_19 #circuitbreakersg #wfh #stayathome #solorunner #nightrunning #earlyofthemonth #crazyatwork
