Breaded Fillet of Haddock on a salad of Kale, Cherry Tomatoes, Black Olives, and Quinoa, with thinned Tartar sauce and some chilli oil. Sorry, but no crisps allowed. Haddock was flaky with the breading that is crunchy; the salad refreshing and light! 👌🏻 #workfromhome #workfromhomemeal #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
