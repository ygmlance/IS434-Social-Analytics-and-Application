Little highlight on my first appearance on TV. I am very shy and nervous during the interview. Luckily both DJs @kennethjianwen and LiNa are Super friendly and guided me through the interview. 
I am not an expert in sewing as I am still in learning stage. I learned sewing 3D masks and bags from my teacher Jacquelene of @sewingseedsofluv . She is so kind to provide free mask patterns for us to download at https://www.facebook.com/1412049458854756/posts/2989898827736470/
.
Those mask pattern came in few different sizes to fit all faces. Those who are interested can feel free to download it. .

Some of the bags are taught by another teacher @applelulucrafts . Feel free to check out her sewing and her classes available after the CB over.

Thanks for the support üòò
