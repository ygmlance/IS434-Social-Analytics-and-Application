When the little red scooter matches your dress. It’s a win. .

It also means you don’t have to move anything for a photo. I tried riding this and almost cracked it half. Eivor was not pleased with me. I did manage to get on Adam’s turtle (think it’s actually called an EZRoller) and roll around the lobby but then the security guard saw me and openly laughed at my giant 6’ self crumpled on a 6 year olds ride so maybe I’ll give the kids their toys back and sit the f down on the bench. Although it was pretty fun so chances are I’ll be back scootering with the kids. Acting like a kid is way more fun than acting like a grown up. And princess dresses are more widely accepted too. And snacks. They get way more snacks than most grown ups do. Oh- and I will totally work for gummy bears. Those things are gold. Damn being a kid is great! Why do they keep complaining then?! .
