vanilla cream puffs!! aka Choux au Craquelin ðŸ˜‹ bringing back them beard papa cravings bc the craquelin layer (top cookie layer) was the best part it was so crispy!! glad it cracked nicely in the oven! took q long to make this bc there were many steps, but recipe was easy to follow! can see myself making this many more times in diff flavors n fillings ðŸ˜€
