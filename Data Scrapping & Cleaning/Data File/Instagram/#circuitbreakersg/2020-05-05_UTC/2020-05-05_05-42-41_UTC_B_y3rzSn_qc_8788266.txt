Some flowers to brighten up my feed! Since the #circuitbreaker began, I haven't been able to order flowers off the small florist shop every week..
.
Can't wait for them to be open again to order flowers for the house and I sure hope they survived these two months of downtime. Meanwhile gotta find some service online, share below if you guys know of any favourite online store that delivers.💐
