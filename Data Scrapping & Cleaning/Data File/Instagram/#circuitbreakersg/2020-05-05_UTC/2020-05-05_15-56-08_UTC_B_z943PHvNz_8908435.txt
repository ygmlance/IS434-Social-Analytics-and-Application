Day 29 Circuit Breaker Lunch. Double lunch today as I was still hungry after my Greendot lunch. ðŸ˜… 
This western food from Ang Mo Kio recommended by colleague. Looks great here on pic but I think could have been better if
1) they don't add sugar to sweeten the cherry tomatoes
2) they don't sweeten the Mac & Cheese
3) they don't add so much salt in their soup (trust me if I say something is too salty!)
