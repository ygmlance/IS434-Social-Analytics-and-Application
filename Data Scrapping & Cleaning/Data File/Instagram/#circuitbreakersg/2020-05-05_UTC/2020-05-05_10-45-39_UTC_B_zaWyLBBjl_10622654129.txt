Today would be our first day, post CB but the Govt has better plans. On another note, we have less than a month before the CB extension ends and we have already completed more than â…“ of Ramadan.
So let's celebrate life with another bake.
.
World!  Please meet Mesh Om Ali or Phyllo Milk Pie, creatively styled by sis to resembles the blossoms of a peony.
Sprinkled with bits of pistachio, dark chocolate and cinnamon.
.
Since the supermarket has run out of tepongs (thanks eh, horders), will have to make do and explore other options with what's available.
I have something special in mind to bake but that shall wait till the CB rules have relaxed. I will bake when I move back home, I miss my Ariston oven.
