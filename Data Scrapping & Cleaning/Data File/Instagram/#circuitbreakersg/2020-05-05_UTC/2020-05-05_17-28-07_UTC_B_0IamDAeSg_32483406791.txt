Chinese cuisine for dinner because I realised I haven’t cooked much of it lately. So I thought I’d make some thing out of my leftover ingredients—asparagus.

I made stir-fried asparagus with carrots and enoki mushrooms in thickened egg-drop oyster sauce, garnished with fried shallots.

The other dish is prawn and tofu in chilli crab sauce (the prawns are buried under that thick delicious sauce). Dinner was served with steamed basmati rice.

Chilli crab sauce is very easy to make if you have a small food blender. No need for Prima Taste premix. Let me know if it’s something you’d like to know how to make.
