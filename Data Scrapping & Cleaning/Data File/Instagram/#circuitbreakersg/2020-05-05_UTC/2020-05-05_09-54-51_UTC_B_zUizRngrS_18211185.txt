05 May 20 :: Day 29 of CB #circuitbreakersg. #wfh #sgunited #stayhomesg and #je55cooks crispy #MinChiangKueh #apamBalik for afternoon tea.
.
Did a small batch to test out the crispiness.
.
Ingredients ::
90g plain flour
50g rice flour
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 egg
30g sugar
60ml water

Fillings ::
Sugar
Butter
Coarsely grounded peanuts
Creamy sweet corn
Nutella 
Banana

Method ::
Mix all the ingredients together until smooth and no lumps. Leave it to rest in fridge for at least 30mins.

Heat pan. Slightly oil the pan and pour in one scoop of batter. Spread out thinly.

When batter starts to bubble on top, spread some butter. Sprinkle sugar and other fillings you want to put. 
Leave it to cook for a while until bottom is brown. Once done, fold into half and serve hot.

This was not too bad but could be crispier - my kind. Most importantly, need a good pan for this.

Peanut & creamy sweet corn, Nutella & Banana, which one do you like?
