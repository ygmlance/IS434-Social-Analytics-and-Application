#Circuitbreakersg Day 29
.
Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
.
There's something about the sky before a storm that makes me marvel at nature's power and the ever changing canvas in the sky .
We've made it past the halfway mark of the circuit breaker. Well done everyone 👏🏼
