It’s almost time to celebrate Mother’s Day and we had been wanting to create some decor ideas about celebrating at home, if you and mom are living together during this time 💕 .
.
Some simple party decor definitely helps to brighten up the atmosphere and injects in the mood of celebration 🎉 The shown wall decor was done in just 15 minutes with adding the 2 banners in. Very easy and best part is those fans & banners can be reused for other occasions such as girl’s birthday, bridal shower, CNY, etc. You can share the love by lending those decor picks you friends age families too. .

As we were planning this set, we thought we could just do with some waffles, macarons and cookies. But doorbell rang and @cakedwithlovebyjacqueline sent over a Mother’s Day surprise gift, a gorgeous floral chocolate cake with sugarless cream. How perfect! And the colours blend in 😍 thank you so much for the love 😘 Oh yah, for 3LittlePicks followers, remember to quote our name to score a discount when you book your cake orders 😉 DM them if you have any enquirers 👌🏻
