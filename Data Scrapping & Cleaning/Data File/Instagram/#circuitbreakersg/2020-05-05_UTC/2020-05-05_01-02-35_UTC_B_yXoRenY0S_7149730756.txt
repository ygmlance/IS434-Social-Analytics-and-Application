“I was an extreme workaholic when I was younger. I enjoyed doing everything by myself and taking on all the responsibilities. I would plan so far ahead that I'd work early in the day, late at night so that I could make up for lost time in the future. Imagine that!⠀
⠀
Many things changed when my baby came, even more so when the circuit breaker hit us. When you're the mother of a seven month old, managing a fast growing brand, and settling household chores, you come to learn that you won't be able to do everything by yourself. No man is an island, right? So I learned to let go. I delegate more work, take on a more supervisory role with my colleagues, and my husband helps me out with the chores at home.⠀
⠀
Now I have more balance in my life to do for myself the things that are important instead of the things that are urgent. Every mother will drift towards putting herself last for her children and her family, but caring for ourselves is what makes us a better mother, friend, wife, and colleague.⠀
⠀
This balance has also helped me to let go of more things and enjoy the present, instead of constantly planning and worrying for the future.⠀
⠀
I believe that there are no hard and fast rules to be a good parent or a good mother. We don't have to hold ourselves up to become supermoms, we just need to accept ourselves and our efforts. We, as mothers innately know that we are nurturing, we are loving, and we are strong. This can never be a bad idea.” ⠀
