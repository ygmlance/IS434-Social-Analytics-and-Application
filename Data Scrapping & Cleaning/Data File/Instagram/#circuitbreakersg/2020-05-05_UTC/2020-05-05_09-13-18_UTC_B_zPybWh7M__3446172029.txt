Yesterday’s calligraphy work which marked the day that our circuit breaker was supposed to end! 28 days just flew by somehow, even though it felt like a lifetime when going through it. From today onwards we have 28 more days till the extension of the circuit breaker (hopefully!!!) ends on June 1st! So I thought, ok, what other 28-day project shall I do? Find out tonight! Hint: it’s what hanakrafts is all about! #handletteringdaily #circuitbreakersg #lifeinthetimeofcorona #maythefourthbewithyou
