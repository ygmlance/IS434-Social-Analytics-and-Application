We are almost 30 days into circuit breaker and I need some inspiration after cooking straight for 30 days ! Thanks to my dear friend @rockondd , I hit upon a recipe for #mujadara  from @cookieandkate . I also decided to pair it with #zhoug that’s beautifully simple and high on flavor!

Here’s an easy recipe for this pilaf that is #vegan and is a crowd pleaser from what I have heard
