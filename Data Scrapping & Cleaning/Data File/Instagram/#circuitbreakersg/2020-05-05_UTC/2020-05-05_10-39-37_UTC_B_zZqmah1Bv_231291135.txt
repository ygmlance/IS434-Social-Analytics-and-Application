Tekka Market went on Facebook today with various stallholders coming together to offer their vegetables, fruits, dried goods and poultry on Facebook Live. Went online to support them and got myself a vegetable set. They offer free delivery for a combined order of $20 from any stall (mix and match). How awesome is that! Their next attempt on online sale is 12 May on Tekka Online Market Facebook Page.
