Trying out a new recipe - marble almond cake! 🍰
✨
Love how healthy the cake is as it’s both oil free and dairy free. The taste and texture are not compromised as the resulting cake is both crumbly and fluffy. The steps for making this is quite simple too. Had a major craving for smth chocolatey so I decided to add melted dark chocolate to part of the batter to create the swirls. The chocolate portion is not a lot, but it’s definitely distinct. And using couverture chocolate is definitely more luscious. The chocolate from @valrhona_asia never disappoints! 🍫

Kept a couple of slices for breakfast today, and I think it’s even better overnight, more moist and flavourful! 😋
