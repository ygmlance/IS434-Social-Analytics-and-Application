Helloooooo "circuit breaker" day 29!  Hers and his late lunch series... My pancake is loaded with cheese today and topped with scrambled eggs, bacon and some mayo... Served @iamivanlau's scrambled eggs and bacon with toast grilled in a pan and with lashings of butter... Bread grilled in a pan adds a whole new level of "chao da" (burnt) flavour to the  toast... Kinda reminiscent of the "chao da" flavour of the local kaya (coconut jam) toast toasted on charcoal!  @iamivanlau was a happy camper! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
