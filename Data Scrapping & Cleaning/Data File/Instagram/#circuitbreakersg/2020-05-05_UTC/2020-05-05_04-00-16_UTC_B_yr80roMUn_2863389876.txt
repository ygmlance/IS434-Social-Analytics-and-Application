Do we look alike? #MamaandGen .
I was gonna take a selfie with my @singaporelactationbakes cookie when hubs walked over with Gen. He was being a tattletale telling her that mama don’t share cookies! But she does eat everything that I eat through my breastmilk right?! I mean that’s why she’s so chubby right? 😂 I wanted to share that these bakes really did help me increase my milk production especially in the first two weeks. Will share more breastfeeding tips next time. 💡

They are considered essentials during this #circuitbreakerSG so order away! I just did too.
