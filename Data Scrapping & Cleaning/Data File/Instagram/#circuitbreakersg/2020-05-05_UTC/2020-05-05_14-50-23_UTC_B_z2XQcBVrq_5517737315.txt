Highways resting moments. ðŸŽµ 
An empty street
An empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone ðŸŽ¶ 
The rooms are getting smaller
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
Oh yeah
And all my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far
