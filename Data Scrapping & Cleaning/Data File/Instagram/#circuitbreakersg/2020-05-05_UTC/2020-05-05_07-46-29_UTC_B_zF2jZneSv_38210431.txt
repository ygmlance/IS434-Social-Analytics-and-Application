Brought the kids out in the early morning for a walk around the hood because school holidays. We wore masks and brought a bottle of water before setting off, avoiding any crowd (the whole neighbourhood was pretty empty) by walking along a canal.

We came across a lizard, a woodpecker and a secret garden of sorts. 😍😁 Occasionally, we saw some people walking their dogs and kids.
