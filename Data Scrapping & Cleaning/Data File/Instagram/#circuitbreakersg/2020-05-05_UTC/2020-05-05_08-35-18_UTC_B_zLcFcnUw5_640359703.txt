Throwback to when we had dinner in a restaurant!

Weâ€™ve been loving working from home because we get to spend so much time with the kids and we can definitely see Logan engaging with us more. 
We also got to understand first-hand with what Owen struggles with academically. And it gives us a better view of how to handle that.

What Iâ€™ve learned about Tom is that he sounds more American and is a pacer during conference calls.
Weâ€™ve also switched sides on our bed to make life more interesting.

Iâ€™m all for normalcy right now. But little wins in this circuit breaker will do! ðŸ¦
