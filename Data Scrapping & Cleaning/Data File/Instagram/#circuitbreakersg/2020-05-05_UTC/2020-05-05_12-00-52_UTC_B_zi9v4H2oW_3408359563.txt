Day 29 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg - 5 May 2020 - Too hungry after a Zoom meeting to make anything from scatch and decided to use #leftovers and #stalebread to make an #easypeasy #nofilter #simpledinner of #meatballs - Ingredients were the #leftover #dumpling filling from Day 28, mixed with #leftover #waterchestnuts , diced, from Day 25 and some stale #breadcrumbs, a touch of soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine and Chinese black vinegar; coated with flour, egg and more stale #breadcrumbs; double-fried at 2 temperatures. It was so #yummy ! Reminds me of the wonderful #meatballs that my dearest mum used to make when we were kids. Ate them with #leftover ketchup (just like we used to when we were kids) from unused satchets from KFC deliveries ðŸ¤­ #wastenotwantnot #stayhomewithascott #homecooking
