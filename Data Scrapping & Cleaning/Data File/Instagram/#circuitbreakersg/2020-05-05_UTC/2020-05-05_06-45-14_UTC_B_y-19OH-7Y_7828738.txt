“What’s for lunch?” - the usual question 🤦‍♀️ After much ‘discussion’ on what to eat/ pack, decision was to eat at home #whatabigdecision 
da bao seems to be a harder choice!
So lunch is, homemade dumplings, and pre packed noodles, tossed with shallot oil and some basic seasoning. 
Preparation was pretty quick, and now, what’s for  dinner 🤔 .
