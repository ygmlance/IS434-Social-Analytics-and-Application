It's Day 1 of May school holidays and it feels slightly odd to call it that. DAS has decided to continue with online classes to help our students with learning difficulty keep up and stay active.

Parents and caretakers, thank you for supporting us. We hope you are coping well while DAS continues to offer you our best support!

How was your day today? React, like or comment!
