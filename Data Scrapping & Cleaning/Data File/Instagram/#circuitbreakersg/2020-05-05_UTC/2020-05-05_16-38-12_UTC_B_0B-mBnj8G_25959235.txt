02/05/20 | CB Day 26 - Such a joy watching him solve the puzzles. At times he does get stuck and asks for help but he is getting better at it. Fixing these puzzles ðŸ§© helps in developing his problem solving skills and most importantly, itâ€™s one of the best activities (for me) because it keeps Lincoln busy in his own little world while I do my stuffs ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™ve been buying so many different puzzles and I do not know how to organize or store the boxes anymore! I need to find space because more games are on itâ€™s way! This CB period stay-home need to buy more games to keep the boy busy! *Ah-hem* ðŸ˜„
