Mouth-watering deal from Collin's on Grab Food: combo sets are having a 50% discount. We ordered the Pork Chops + Pork Ribs ($14 after discount) and the portion was big enough for two small eaters. /

The pork chops were thick and chunky while the fork-tender ribs were some parts sweet, some parts savoury and all parts scrumptious. All sets come with a salad, corn on the cob, spaghetti and mushroom soup. /

Wallet-friendly and wholly satisfying meal from Collin's. Don't say bo jio.
