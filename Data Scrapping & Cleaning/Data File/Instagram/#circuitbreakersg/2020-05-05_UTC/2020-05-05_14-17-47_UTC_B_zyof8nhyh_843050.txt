5 May | 1 of the targets I’ve set for #josiahchin during this #circuitbreaker is to master #touchtyping. 
During FHBL, we both realised that if his learning is gonna be getting more digital, then he has to acquire the basic ICT skills earlier. Thankfully there’re tonnes of fun ways to learn this online, in the form of games & conquering stages. 
I’m just glad that the school holiday has arrived and I can finally devote some time to my own kids. ❤️❤️❤️
