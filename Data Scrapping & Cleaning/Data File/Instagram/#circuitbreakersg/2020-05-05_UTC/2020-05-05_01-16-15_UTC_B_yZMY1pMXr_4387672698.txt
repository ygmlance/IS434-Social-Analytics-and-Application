Day 29 / C. Breaker, not much difference to my own personal lifestyle as I have always preferred staying in than heading out. Though I kinda wanna be globe trekking (the adventurer in me love exploring other culture) There goes my 2020 travel plans. On a bigger note, money is now an issue as I work part-time in a F&B sector, I need to work to actually get paid but due to the new measures & operating time, shifts get lesser and I earn lesser. My studies are also affected and delayed due to MCO in Msia. I just hope that all the bad of these whole new decade stay in 2020 & this too shall pass. Meanwhile stay safe everyone!
