I went on a lockdown adventure this evening. Caught the MRT for the first time in months to pick up some takeaway dinner after work. This was during peak hour; it was eerily quiet.
.
My chirashi from @ishinomakigrillnsake in Orchard was excellent and great value especially with the pick-up discount.
