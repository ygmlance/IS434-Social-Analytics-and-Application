[Homecooked] Cir Breaker Day 29 Dinner.
It's a 1 dish meal tonight. Cooked a huge wok of fried bee hoon with char siu, sliced shiitake mushrooms, prawns, cabbage, carrots, beansprouts and egg. And as usual, I cooked so much that we could eat the leftovers for another 2 meals.
Added some airfried chicken nuggets cos the Mister didn't had his fill yesterday. 
Washed down the meal with takeaway green bean soup for dessert .
