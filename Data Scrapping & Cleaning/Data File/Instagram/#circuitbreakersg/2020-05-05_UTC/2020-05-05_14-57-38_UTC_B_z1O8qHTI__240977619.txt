Back to wash the mat with my sweat this evening with @compoundworkout @coachjake_ @coachjake_ .
My take away today was that form is more important compared to how much I do. I know this, but sometimes, fatigue and hastiness gets the better of me and I forget to hold my core or straighten my back. I'm lucky I have not injured myself so far, but I should not take it for granted. The right FORM is IMPORTANT!
