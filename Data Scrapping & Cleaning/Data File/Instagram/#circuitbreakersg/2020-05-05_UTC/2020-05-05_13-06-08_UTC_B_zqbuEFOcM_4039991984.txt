#Circuitbreakersg Day- 30 Clay pot fish head , with Thread fin & egg tofu lightly fried, Napa cabbage, green onions, roast meat, 3 kinds of mushrooms, bean curd skins,corn and sweet peas ... everything in a pot !! ðŸ˜ƒ Itâ€™s time consuming frying the fish and tofu, so I donâ€™t cook it often ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ but itâ€™s worth the time and effort each time.
