🏠 Day ????
.
I’ve lost all count of the days thanks to my short attention span wandering elsewhere.
.
However! I made a brownie today (or technically, yesterday). This was the first time I’ve ever made a brownie, and I think I can count the number of times I’ve eaten one on one hand in all my years (mind you, that’s a lot of years).
.
So I’m really not sure if this is how brownies are supposed to taste like... But my in-house dessert expert says it’s good! Which is great because he’s gonna be the one eating most of it anyways.
