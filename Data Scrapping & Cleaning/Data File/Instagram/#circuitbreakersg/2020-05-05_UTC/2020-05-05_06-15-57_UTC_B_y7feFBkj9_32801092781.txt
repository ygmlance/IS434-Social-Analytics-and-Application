Circuit breaker Day 29: Italian lunch from @visitrubato 👍👍👍 Good seafood risotto & chicken! Lovely touch for a birthday with the lava cake & icecream 🥳 Loved the halloumi (I always like halloumi) though the salad could be fresher. Didn’t get a pasta because the pastas I’ve dabaoed so fat arrive way too soggy. One of the restaurants I’ll wanna try when CB is over!
📍Rubato (Bukit Timah)
