Well, as we’re still confined at home for this month, thought I would make the most of this situation and share about the food we’ve been having - all prepared by my mum, from raw ingredients sourced from various suppliers and delivered to us at home. I love to cook, but my mum is definitely queen of the kitchen.

Photo 1: Yummy fried eggs with tomatoes and spring onions from @misterchincai @chincaijiak. The eggs were moist, and the tomatoes were fresh and juicy. Need i say more? A classic Chinese dish that’s very more-ish especially with steaming hot rice!
.
Photo 2: Stirfried broccoli (from @misterchincai too) and carrots, with 贵妃鲍, an imitation abalone. Still a shellfish of some sort, but i don’t know its name in English. The broccoli was fresh and juicy, I helped to finish most of it!
.
Photo 3: Braised pork belly (the raw pork was also bought from a supplier and delivered). This was the star of the night. The pork belly was so well cooked, it was melting in the mouth. It reminds me of 卤肉饭 in Taiwan. I need to learn from my mum how to cook this dish!
