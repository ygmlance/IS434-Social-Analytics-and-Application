𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟐𝟗 - Another day, another meal, another sauce kit. 😅 𝐌𝐚𝐩𝐨 𝐓𝐨𝐟𝐮 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐊𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐞 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐍𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬 is on #tastytuesday’s menu. I call this the Chinese-style Bolognese. LOL. 🍜>🍚 anytime! ⁣⁣

PS: It just a curd to me that I’m using more of ready to cook sauce kits nowadays. Don’t judge, okay? 😝I know some of you might prefer to #cookfromscratch. Well, who wouldn’t? I would too if I’ve all the time in the world but unfortunately, I don’t. Plus, sometimes it makes more economic sense to buy the sauce kit, especially when you just want to satisfy your craving for certain dishes and won’t be using the spices or condiments frequently. To each his/her own and whatever makes you tick, I guess. #開心就好 💕⁣
