Let’s get unready together! My favourite part of the day, it always feels like I’m melting all the stress away 😌 don’t you agree?😉
I always always double cleanse, I use my wipes or make up remover and then follow up with my favourite cleanser.

Here’s a step by step of how I remove my make up for my sensitive skin!
💦Step 1: Remove foundation, brows & lipstick with micellar water wipes.
💦Step 2: Soak cotton pads with our Gently off eye&lip remover and let it sit on my eyes for ~10s 👉🏻DO NOT RUB your eyes, the skin there is really delicate, just let it sit, it will melt off all your waterproof mascara/eyeliners. Gently wipe sideways/downwards.
💦 Step 3: Wet face, massage your cleanse off oil onto your skin to dislodge all leftover products on skin. Rinse off.
💦Step 4: Follow up with your favourite cleanser and wash as usual. ✨AND YOU’RE DONE! ✨
