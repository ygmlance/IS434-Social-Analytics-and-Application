While many Singaporeans experience inconvenience during the circuit breaker period, they are still in the comfort of their homes, knowing that there is still someone clearing the rubbish, sweeping the roads and clearing the drains and sewers making sure our living space is clean and hygiene.
Let us remind ourselves of the contributions such workers make.

When you come into contact with these heroes, we can make eye contact with them, nod our heads or wave our hands in appreciation.

Please say "Thank You" where possible. .
