I still remember the couple of times when I was working part time and got home at 10pm and she had a midnight concall, instead of resting from her long day of work, she would always whip up a meal for me and even prepared my lunch the next day just so I can save extra cash. I always consider myself to be a lucky kid because even up till now, my mum still fixes breakfast for her 3 working children just so we wouldn\u2019t starve before lunch.

Flying halfway round the world to have ice cream with me when I couldn\u2019t handle being away from home on exchange, flying across continents to pick up luggage from my second brother when he was on exchange even if it meant excess baggage for them and not even catching a glimpse of him, spending sleepless nights worrying about my youngest brother when he contracted his rare disease that was potentially fatal, giving up her job to take care of dad when he was battling stage four of a rare cancer. Life has dealt us a tough hand but I\u2019ll play the cards in mine and count my forever blessings for a mum like her (: @sinjey",

She would say: \"It looks like you had a bad day, want to talk about it?\" \" I think you need some ice cream, let's just you and me go get some.\"\nMy mom has superpowers. She is an extraordinary woman with extraordinary love. She shared that love with me so that I, too, can be extraordinary.\nThe good news is now I'm a mom. And wouldn't you know it...I can feel them sprouting, even as we speak...eyes on the back of my head!\nI love you my Mom, Ummi!!! \ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d\n@_nsssknhhhh",
