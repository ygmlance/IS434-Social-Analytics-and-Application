Five minutes into finally sitting down after preparing lunch, your toddler drops his bowl. Your older child shouts out for mathematics help. You haven’t had breakfast and there are still things on your plate not done for work.

When the mess is cleaned and you rest your back for awhile, the kids want ice cream. They need their pencils sharpened. They want to bake a cake. They would like you to draw a perfect circle for the sun on their art work. They need help with the scissors. Someone did a poo. Someone needs a cuddle. And for a moment you can’t remember if you’ve had lunch already.

In the midst of the chaos, remember that to our little ones, we are everything. And because we are everything to them, the only people they come to for help is us. Hang in there mummies. Let’s all stop for a minute today, breathe, give yourself a pat on your back and know that your little ones love and appreciate you so much. #mummies #mummiesalive #welovemummy #circuitbreakersg #mothersdayiscoming #appreciateyourmum #everymomday #havesomeicecreamtoo #hanginthere
