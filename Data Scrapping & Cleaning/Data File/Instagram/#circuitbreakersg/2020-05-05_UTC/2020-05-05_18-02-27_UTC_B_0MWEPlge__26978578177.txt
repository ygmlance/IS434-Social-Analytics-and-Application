• Throwback to when I was itching to try out a new pancake mix (we usually make ours from scratch) for breakfast - I wanted to experiment to see if I could convert a pancake mix into a waffle one. 30 minutes later, I had successfully tweaked the pancake recipe to a waffle one, realised that I was too hungry to set up the waffle maker, and proceeded to.. make pancakes instead. Talk about a detour, huh.

Waffle batter generally has a higher proportion of sugar and fat, to help it caramelise and achieve the crisp edges that we all love. The panffles I created had a nice crisp exterior while remaining soft and fluffy on the inside, and were extremely filling thanks to the higher fat content (Have I mentioned how eggs and butter are my weaknesses?). I used the Prima Pancake Mix for this one. They provide great recipes on their website too! I’m just going to revert to making my own batters the next time I crave pancakes, or waffles, or both! • .
