Tonight's dinner of laksa pasta with grilled prawns, topped with crispy laksa leaves and calamansi on the side. The laksa sauce was the perfect mix of spicy, fragrant, creamy and tangy. I cannot rave enough about my love for calamansi and its magic.⁣
⁣
Really easy to make, especially if you have store-bought laksa paste around. Takes 30mins tops.⁣
⁣
1. Fry laksa leaves until crispy, then set aside⁣
2. Grill/fry shrimp on high heat, then set aside⁣
3. Fry chopped onions and garlic in shrimp oil on medium. Add laksa paste and fry until oil turns red⁣
4. Add coconut milk and some water to make it more saucy. Simmer until pasta is almost cooked⁣
5. Throw pasta into sauce and add some pasta water to finish cooking. Toss toss stir stir. Taste and season⁣
6. Toss some super thinly sliced kaffir lime leaves into the sauce⁣
7. Plate it up with the prawns on the side, laksa leaves on top, and a cute little calamansi on the side⁣
8. Pretend you are not on a national lockdown but instead at a fancy cafe that sells laksa pasta for at least $22 and giggle because you only spent ~$4 per serving ⁣
