🌮Happy Cinco De Mayo and there’s no better way to celebrate than #tacotuesday🌮 Crispy tacos with seasoned steak cubes and grilled shrimps and stuffed with lime salsa, guac, 4 different kinds of cheese (Peppery Jack, Cheddar, Mozzarella and Nacho) and habanero sauce 😝⁣

Talk about a flavor explosion in our mouths! The rest of the leftover ingredients ( Cilantro rice, black beans, cheese, guac, shrimps, steak and chicken) were thrown into a @lecreusetsg bakeware and baked at 190 for 20 mins till the cheese was sizzling and golden! Had a splendid meal indeed ❤️⁣
