This extended Circuit Breaker period can be stressful especially for those that had been working from home 👨🏽‍💻👩🏽‍💻.
• 
In order to cope or deal with the stress, we need to free our mind and give our body time to recharge to build that energy back.
•
So where do I get my energy from to deal with those demands. For me, I got them from my oils. Diffusing them in the day and at night, topically applying to points where it can benefit me especially on my back.
•
Different oils for different uses. And I am thankful for these oils. 🥰
