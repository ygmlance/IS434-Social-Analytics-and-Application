#Painting days are such a mixed bag. Zero effort at getting them on board (esp. for finger-painting like today), but ton of cleaning up needed post that. And if they are messy bunnies like mine, they would need to be dunked in a tub as well (i.e - more work, with more cleaning after), as that copious amount of #paint isn't coming off easy! The results bring a lot of joy and pride though....till the younger one rips it apart, kicking off fresh rounds of mediation ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜¬.
P.S: Shivin's artwork was converted into a birthday card for his lovely teacher!
