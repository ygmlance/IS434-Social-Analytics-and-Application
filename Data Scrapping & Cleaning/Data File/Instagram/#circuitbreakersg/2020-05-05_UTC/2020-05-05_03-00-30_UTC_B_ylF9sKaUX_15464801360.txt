🙏In the past few weeks, the Covid-19 Pandemic has thrown us into a time of uncertainty as Singapore went into Circuit Breaker mode and all F&B's were to close for dine-ins. Despite the unfortunate situation, we are extremely grateful to have received unending support from all of you through your orders and kind words of encouragement. ⁠
⁠
🚗💨We have also launched islandwide delivery, teaming up with many delivery uncles and aunties in order to help fulfill your orders. All delivery fees we have received from you goes directly to them and your orders help keep them going :) ⁠
⁠
🙇So we would just like to say a huge THANK YOU to everyone- NUS staff and students, professors, teachers, relatives, friends, regulars for helping to keep Sapore's lights on and running - we couldn't have done it without you!⁠
⁠
💪Stay safe and healthy, we hope to see you soon. ⁠
⁠
❤️Love, ⁠
Sapore Team⁠
