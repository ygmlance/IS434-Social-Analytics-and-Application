Some days, the older 2 decide that they are best of friends and the little one feels all left out. It often happens when I’m busy cooking and who has the bandwidth to watch the fire and console a kid who may or may not need a cuddle.

My trick is to give the odd child out (coz sometimes it’s number 2 who’s the one) a small task in the kitchen to keep little hands busy. It helps soften the sting of being excluded, keeps them out of trouble and cuts down the likelihood of them antagonizing the rest with their bids for attention.

So this is one of those tasks I have that doesn’t need my attention and he’s happy to do. Breaking walnuts down into small pieces for our bread. He soon forgot about his brothers, chattered and sang to me and his brothers got to have their quiet time together.

It’s not always like this. I actually have to have the presence of mind to do such things:
1. Notice the dynamics between the boys and avert the disaster early on.
2. Have an age appropriate activity.
3. Try not to get annoyed with the others excluding the third.

The current #circuitbreakersg is really testing my patience and tolerance for continuous chaos. But I’m also learning to deal with a house full of XYs.
