Plant-based is fun with endless variety.

Cooked veggie yellow curry for lunch. Whatâ€™s inside? Potato, carrot, yellow onion, celery, sweet pea, eggplant, baby corn, french bean, bean curd skin, shiitake mushroom. And lots of love. ðŸ˜Š
This is very low spicy level. The kids and the helper cannot handle ðŸŒ¶ðŸ”¥.
Served with @omnimeat wanton soup and brown rice. I made the wanton yesterday and there are diced carrot, celery and mushroom with omnimeat inside.

Healthy and yummy. Full of protein. More importantly, full of fibre too. There are numerous studies showing that most people do not have enough fibre in their diet, which is a contributing factor to a number of health problems later in life.
