💔Staying at home EVERY single day isn’t easy for couples 💘
.
I noticed we had more arguments than usual. As a parent, the usual fights are often due to kids as we have different opinion on things 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦
.
With this circuit breaker, we face many frustrations because there are more things to accomplish and that made me NOT in my best positive self 😌
.
At times, i felt angry and we both flared up🔥
.
I felt i needed something to heal the inner me. My usual therapy was to go pak tor (on a date) without the kids or do some retail therapy. Unfortunately, we are stuck at home and stuck with the kids 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦
.
So, i took out this Couple Goals Journal and see how it can help me. I just randomly flipping around and i stopped at this Reflections page that says “Things that made me smile” 🙂
.
I began to recall happy, fun and beautiful moments that we had ❤️
.
“I giggled at some memories” This lead me to think of how much i ❤️ him and my anger slowly dissipate ☺️
.
I feel every couple should own this journal. I’m going to use this journal more often and hopefully when we grow old, we can look back to what we’ve written down. And at sad or angry times, i have this journal to remind us what’s most important to us ❤️
