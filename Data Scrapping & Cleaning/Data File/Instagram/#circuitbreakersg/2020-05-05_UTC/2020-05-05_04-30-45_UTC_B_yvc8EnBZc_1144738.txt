Thanks for sending this over Manna Pot, nice to have a tasty healthy meal: Grain bowl with pan seared salmon, peas, spinach, and pasta.
The bonus is that it’s so pretty too!
You can order this from halal caterer Manna Pot, and they offer subscriptions which means you can not worry about your meals because it’ll get delivered to you. This is excellent for non cooks during this period.
