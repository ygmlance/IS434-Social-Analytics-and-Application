| CB ~ Day 29 | #shisenhanten
As a lover of Sichuan Mapo Tofu from the early days of travelling to China, I've grown to love this dish very much. So we've tried making this with spices from Yue Hwa Emporium, and it is now one of our fave #homecooked dishes.
.
Still, we've been meaning to savour the gold standard of #MapoTofu, which we did with some Providence.
.
Five days ago, we received a wonderful #carepackage comprising 3 of 2-Michelin* Shisen Hanten by Chen Kentaro's cult faves.
.
Gladly enough, there was Chen's Mapo Tofu. Nothing beats this really. Minced meat and silky-smooth tofu blanketed by a luscious and velvety bean-paste sauce that envelopes your tastebuds like no other. Heaped onto warm Hokkaido rice, each scoop was a refined and delightful 'oomph' with gentle, well-balanced notes.

An indulgence. But think we might just have some more.
