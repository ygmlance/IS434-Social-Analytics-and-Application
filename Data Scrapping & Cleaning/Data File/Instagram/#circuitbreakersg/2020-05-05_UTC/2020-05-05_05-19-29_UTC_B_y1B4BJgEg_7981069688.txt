Stanley Turrentine - That’s Where It’s At, 1962. Stan was the master of soul jazz and this record sees him team up with Les McCann on the piano, who himself was an innovator in soul music. The album is a mix of soul, r&b and the blues, so easy to sit back and listen. Les stands out on the piano in every track, Stan grabs hold of the music and puts you in the mood. Pia is the standout track for me. This album will be out on the Tone Poet series sometime soon.  #stanleyturrentine #thatswhereitsat #lesmccann #herbielewis #otisfinch #bluenoterecords
