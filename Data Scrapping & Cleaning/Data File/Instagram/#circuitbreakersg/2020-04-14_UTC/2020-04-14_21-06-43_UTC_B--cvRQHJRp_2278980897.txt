SINGAPORE, now it is mandatory, with immediate effect, for everyone to wear a mask when they step out of your house as part of stricter measures to curb the further spread of the coronavirus.

Those who do not risk a $300 fine for first-time offenders.

There are exemptions for those engaging in strenuous exercise and children below the age of two, as medical experts recommend against them wearing masks, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said at a media conference on Tuesday (April 14).
Please stay home. #sgunited
