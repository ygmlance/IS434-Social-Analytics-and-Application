Aren't you glad we have Grab delivery during this Covid helping you with sending food and other delivery service that helps you to send items such as documents, parcels, and gifts to your business partners, family and friends. 
Am glad that now taxi drivers and food delivery riders can eat at public spaces or in their vehicles if it is not practical for them to head home for meals, the Health Ministry (MOH) clarified on Saturday (April 11). The ministry said workers providing essential services should have meals at their work premises while practising safe distancing.

The update comes after taxi and private-hire car drivers, and food delivery riders told The Straits Times they did not know where to eat during their shifts, after stricter measures banned dining at eateries and hawker centres.
Some resorted to eating off the boot of their vehicle or squatting on the kerb by the road, for fear of breaking the law. .
Thank you guys!
