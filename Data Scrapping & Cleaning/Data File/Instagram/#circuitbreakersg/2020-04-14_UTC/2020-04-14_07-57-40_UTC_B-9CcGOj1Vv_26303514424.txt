Hello everyone! Let us introduce our pawrents! Lol. They are quite unexpectedly together but my dad loves new mom soooo much 😁🤪🥰 and she loves us even more! LOL So we are both very happy & thankful 🙏🏻 .

Hope everyone is staying in, adhering to the rules, spending time with your loved ones. We can all take this time to fix, heal, reflect, get rid of toxication in our lives 🤍 Have courage to make changes you know will be right for you. Stay thankful everyday that we are still breathing & eating . Our doggy heart goes out to those who lost their loved ones to this nasty, strange virus 🦠😢🖤 .
