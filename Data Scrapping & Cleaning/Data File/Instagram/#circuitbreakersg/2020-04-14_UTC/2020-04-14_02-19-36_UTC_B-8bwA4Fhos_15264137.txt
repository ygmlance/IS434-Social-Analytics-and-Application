Covid-19 Circuit Breaker - Day 8.
It was eon years ago that i went to wet market alone, as my wifey had to go to work today. Always marvelled how my missus manages to buy more than 5 items from same stall and knowing exactly if price charged for each item is reasonable, while i waited at the side to help carry.
Was praying i don't get "kotok" by the stallholders today and i actually managed to get all the items at reasonable prices.... Mission accomplished!! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
