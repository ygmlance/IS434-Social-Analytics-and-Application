A very wet day yesterday during our walk at the cemetery! .
.
I was a naughty boy, i literally dodged my furry dad & wanted to sprint to some food on one tombstone just near the road 🤣 but i decided to stop & not make them in distress🛑 because they were yelling so loudly for me to behave, almost waking up the dead! 🤣😂😳🤦🏻‍♀️ its just food!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️😳😆
