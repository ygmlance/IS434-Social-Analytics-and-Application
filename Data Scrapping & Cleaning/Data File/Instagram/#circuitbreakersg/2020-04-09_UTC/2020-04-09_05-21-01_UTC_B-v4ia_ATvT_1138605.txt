Not buying or cooking this afternoon. ⠀
⠀
Gillian, who is a few traffic lights away, packed lunch for me — all because the glutton in me commented on IG that I wanted to try her pork ribs soup with ginseng and white fungus. ⠀
⠀
I ended up with rice, salad and a cheesy spinach ham quiche as well. Too much food! Think I’ll save the rice to fry tonight. ⠀
⠀
Btw, we take the circuit breaker measures very seriously. I went wearing a mask and waited outside as she prepared the food. Thanks much! ⠀
