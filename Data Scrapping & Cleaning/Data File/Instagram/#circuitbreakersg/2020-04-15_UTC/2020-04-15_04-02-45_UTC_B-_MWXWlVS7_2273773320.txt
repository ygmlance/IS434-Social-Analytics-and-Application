| liquid | #circuitbreakersg ~ day 7 ‚òï
And on the 7th day of CB, I made more #DalgonaCoffee, luxed up with dark chocolate balls and a ü§ç if you can spot it.
.
Cos' it's been over 3 weeks since I hand-whipped one with Nescafe Gold Blend. My preference is for a smooth and creamy head. Not meringue-like, cos' I feel this version blends more effortlessly into the CP-Meiji Deluxe Milk without leaving one with a dalgona moustache. And who needs more stirring after you've whipped it 4000 times? üôà.
I also prefer a high ratio of ü•õ to counter the overt sweetness of the toffee-like cap.
.
Ultra-creamy, ICY-COLD 'Wake-the-Dead' coffee for sleepy afternoons when I need to get work done.
.
Iced Whites are now my 'go-to' coffee fix, oh yes.
.
* p/s:  loaded up a wrong pix yest cos' I hv too many versions, I can't even track. Not to mention days and dates now. Sorry guys !
