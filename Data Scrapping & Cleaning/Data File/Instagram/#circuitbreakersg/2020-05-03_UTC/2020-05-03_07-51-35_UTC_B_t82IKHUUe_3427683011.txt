Thank you for responding to our call in the past month to raise funds for @foodbanksg. You have been most generous and we are very touched.
.
From 3 May to 31 May, we take the opportunity to help @healthservesg raise funds for their work with our migrant workers. Takeout is available every Fri, Sat and Sun.
.
Together we can make a little contribution and difference to better the lives of our migrant workers. We look forward to your continued support!
