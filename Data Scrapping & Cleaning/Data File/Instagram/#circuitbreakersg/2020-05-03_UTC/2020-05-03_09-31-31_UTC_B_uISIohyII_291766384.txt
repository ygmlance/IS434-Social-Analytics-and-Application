Craving for blackball so decided to try out @khairulaming taiwanese sweet potato dessert. Had to use corn flour as alternative to tapioca flour coz Raf couldnt find it aniwer. Texture of the potato balls should be more chewy like jelly. Overall Raf said eh sedap jugak... hahaha i passed! #stayhomeforsg #ekamainmasakmasak #tryoutnewrecipe #stayhomestaysafe #circuitbreakersg
