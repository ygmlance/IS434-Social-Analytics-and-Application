Good morning, I hope you are healthy and staying safe! We received many requests about our diaper cakes and requests as to why you are unable to check out your orders via our web-store. In view of the current pandemic and circuit breaker measures, we have not been able to order the materials required for making the diaper cakes - We are working on it and will provide an update once we are able to take in orders again! .
.
We are also donating 80% of our apparels to support a mask making project for the migrant workers at Home Stay Lodge. Please, I thank you all for following our Instagram page still and I hope you continue to do so till we resume business soon - Likely focusing in Niche apparels ❤️ If there is anything u would like to see, send a DM 🙆🏻‍♀️ Sorry for the delay in responding.

Stay safe and healthy! 
Sherine
