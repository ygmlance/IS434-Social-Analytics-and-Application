Hi, how's your Sunday coming along ? .
Some folks asked about some points in the this post https://www.instagram.com/p/B_j_obpgBu1/?igshid=qanzgdfjvq5h 
and one being "How long will you be in your Home? Why this point is important, when deciding if it is the right time to consider refinance ? .
If you have plans to sell your place say under 3 years, suggest you do work your sums against your timelines on selling. Typically, a loan lock-in period ranges 1-3 years offered by banks. Ideally no lock-in is the best. As with all loans, there are loan restrictions if in the event of full capital redemption. Eg of Loan restrictions are lock-in period, prepayment penalty, full redemption penalty, etc. This is important as it could wipe out a hefty portion of your proceeds if not executed wisely. .
You will find this useful!

Enjoy your Sunday and week ahead! .
