Among friends we've been testing so many different food recipes lately coming from a mixture of cultures - Italian bread, Russian salads, Chinese cuisine, Nonya cakes, Healthy gluten free dishes and the latest #Penang delicacies which brings me to this picture..

#Throwback to 5 years ago taken when we were out and about celebrating a friend's wedding, binge eating all the local delicacies and were doing a short days trip around town, taking pictures of the beautiful wall paintings. How I miss moments like this especially in good company, grabbing this shot after waiting in line for sometime with @ginnylim babe. Time passes so fast around us, let's make sure to treasure those around us especially in moments like now. ðŸ’“ .
