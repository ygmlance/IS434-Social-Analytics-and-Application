Day 27 circuit breaker thoughts:

Self- love is not what I do, but what I embody.

Self- love is how I hold myself through dark times, the way I speak to myself when I've fallen off my path. Its the space I give my inner- child to feel, express & move through whatever comes up without judgement.
Self- love is doing the work to forgive myself from the ways I acted from my pain when that behaviour was all I knew.
Self- love is slowing down and taking time to simply feel my feeling before leaping in to change, figure them out, or make sense of them.

Self- love is accepting I am not perfect, and bringing compassion to my process, every step of the way.
Self- love is catching myself in an unloving thought & replacing it with something kind.
Self- love is letting fear & anxiety be my teacher. Is there something I need to clean up, take action on, or a conversation I need to have in order to feel calm, relaxed, happy, etc.

Self- love is doing the hard thing even if I feel resistance because it will serve me in building healthier relationships with others, or living in alignment with my core values.
Self- love is honoring my instincts & trusting my gut.
Self- love is taking a break from "healing work" to simply play, laugh & enjoy my life.

Self- love is tuning inward & asking "What do I need to feel safe/ love/ seen today?" Self- love is getting to know my inner- child & meeting her with tenderness and care.
Self- love is telling myself "I am lovable just as I am", & "its safe to be who I am".
Self- love is learning about my defences & coping mechanisms so I can heal.

Self- love is about coming home to myself & being patient when my old wounds resurface, as they sometimes do, & remembering that each time, I shed a new layer.

The essence of self- love is being true to myself while honoring my human needs for love, connection, safety & security. It's reparenting myself by showing up in the ways I always needed parent to, & offering deep nurturance, love & understanding to all parts of my being.

How do you do self- love, beautiful people?
