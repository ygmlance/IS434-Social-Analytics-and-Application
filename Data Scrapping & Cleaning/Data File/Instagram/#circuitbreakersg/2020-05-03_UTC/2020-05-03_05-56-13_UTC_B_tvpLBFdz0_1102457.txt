#CircuitBreakerSg Day 27! Bought so much bread from OSC FB live few days ago so obliviously I have to make a hearty Sunday brunch for the family! ðŸ˜Š

Cafe food at home! Served toasty country loaf and truffle butter from OSC with the usual classic - creamy scrambled egg, streaky bacon, Johnsonville smoked brat, sautÃ© mushroom, seared tomatoes and coffee! So enjoyable! ðŸ˜‹
