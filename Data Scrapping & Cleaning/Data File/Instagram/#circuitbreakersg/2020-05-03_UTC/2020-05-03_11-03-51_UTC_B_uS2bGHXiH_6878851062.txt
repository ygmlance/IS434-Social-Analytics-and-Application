Make yourself a Healthy Snack 
Guacamole 🥑 🥑 
It’s a very simple and nutritional snack that you can make for yourself while staying at home 🏠You can make a whole pile of it and refrigerate it. Eat it whenever you watch Netflix and dip it with Tortilla chips. (For me, I choose a healthier choice Quinoa Crispibread . It matches well with Guacamole and very crispy. )
Swipe left to hear to the last bit how crunchy the Crispibread is 🤣
Additional ingredients you can add if you like and have at home: Fresh Coriander, jalapeño (for spicy). Personally, I will add more red onion, dice it but not too small, to have a better junky texture while eating. Next time, I will add more garlic (do dice it smaller for this) , Fresh Coriander and Jalapeno as I like 🌶 
Most importantly, the 🥑 avocado has to be ripe so that it is easier to smash it. 
Enjoy making it! ☺️
