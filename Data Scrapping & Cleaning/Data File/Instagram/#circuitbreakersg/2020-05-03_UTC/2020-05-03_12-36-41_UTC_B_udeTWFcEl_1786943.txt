A nice refreshing drink during a hot day, or when you need some sour+sweet flavours to wake yourself up in the afternoon during work from home. ⁣
⁣
Use some of that leftover strawberry compote (see matcha strawberry latte post) and add in a few slices of lemon and strawberries. Top up with sparkling water or carbonated soda (your choice)! ⁣
⁣
Be generous with the ice cubes if you need a super super cold and refreshing drink! I even froze one whole strawberry in the ice so that I get a nice surprise at the end of the drink!
