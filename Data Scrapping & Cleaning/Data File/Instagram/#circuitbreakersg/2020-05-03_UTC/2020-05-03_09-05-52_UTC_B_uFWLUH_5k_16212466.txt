The leftover prawn stock which I made for 🦐Prawn Mee quite awhile ago came into good use for lunch. I used it to braise my favourite home-cooked Fried Black Hokkien Mee and the rich crustacean flavour of the stock certainly lifted the dish to a higher level! Shiok!! 😍😋⁣

Fry garlic. Add noodles and whatever ingredients you fancy. Add stock. Season with fish sauce, soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Braised till noodles are soft. Easy peasy. 😄👍🏻
