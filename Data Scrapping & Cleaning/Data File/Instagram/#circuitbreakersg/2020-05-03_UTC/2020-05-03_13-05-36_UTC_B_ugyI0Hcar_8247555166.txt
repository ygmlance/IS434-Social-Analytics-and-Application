Missing some old school waffles, so I made a batch of pandan waffles. Spread some pandan kaya, and they tasted just like the ones from Prima Deli, but much healthier and nicer, since I always find bakery style waffles to have a tinge of saltiness which I donâ€™t very much prefer. ðŸ§‚

Glad to perfect the recipe this time round. The trick is more coconut milk and to let the batter rest before sending them to the waffle pan. For crispier waffles, air fry or bake them for a short while before serving! ðŸ§‡
