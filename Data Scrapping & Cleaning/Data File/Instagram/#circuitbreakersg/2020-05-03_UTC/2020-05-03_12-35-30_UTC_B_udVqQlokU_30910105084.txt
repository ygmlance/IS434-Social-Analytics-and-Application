Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 27:
My original plan was to make a chocolate chiffon cake for hubs birthday last week. But since he requested for madeleines, my chiffon cake plans got shelved.

Finally got a chance to try the chocolate chiffon cake recipe from @justonecookbook on labour day holiday 2 days ago.

I wasn't sure how to adjust the recipe to fit the size of my chiffon cake tin, so I poured the extra batter into another tin to bake instead.

This cake turned out fluffy and light, but very chocolatey🍫👍🍫 perfect for my chocolate loving hubby😋
