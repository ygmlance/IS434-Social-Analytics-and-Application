Bringing the cafe back home again with my favourite bakes from @petitpain.sg! 🍞
✨
Got the traditional baguette plus orange and chocolate escargot this time, and made French toast using the baguette. I prefer the baguette toasted plain as I find the egg batter making the baguette taste rubbery somehow. But I love how crusty the baguette is! Got this for Mum’s curry chicken since baguette always goes well with curry. Can’t resist adding on the orange and chocolate escargot cos it’s really good! It’s my favourite from them alongside their classic croissant. Got to emphasise again how light their croissants are without feeling greasy at all. Plus, the taste is 💯! Btw this is not sponsored. You know I’m super fussy and it’s so hard to find smth that satisfies my tastebuds. After trying so many croissants recently, I’ve to say it’s the ones here that got my heart! ❤️
