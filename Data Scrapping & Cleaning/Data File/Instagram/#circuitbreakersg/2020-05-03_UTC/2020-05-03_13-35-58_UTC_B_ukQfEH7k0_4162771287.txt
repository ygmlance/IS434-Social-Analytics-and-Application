Day 27 of circuit breaker (3/5/2020).
.
I was out to help mom run errands and was blessed with 2 special deliveries while I was out! .
Thank you @carolynturtle and @mary.lim.5439o for your lovely thoughts and desserts blessing surprises! Coincidentally they ordered from the same bakery shop (Bistro & Bakery) 🤣😋😁😍!. Double portion providence!!! 😁✌👍
.
Thanks again and God bless my dear sisters! .
