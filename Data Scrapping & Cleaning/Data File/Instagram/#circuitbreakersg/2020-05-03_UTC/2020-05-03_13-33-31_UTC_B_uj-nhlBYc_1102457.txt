#CircuitBreakerSg Day 27! Kitchen closed for dinner as we decided to grab dinner from @mamaison.singapore at Mandarin Gallery. They are having 20% discount for Tonkatsu bento box! Of course canâ€™t compare to eating there where you get free flow of soup, rice and cabbage but still pretty enjoyable! ðŸ˜‹
