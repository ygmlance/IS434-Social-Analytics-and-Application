[Day 22] Funtime Challenge Theme: Home 🏠
.
.
House is a building where someone lives whereas Home is a place where you belong! Feeling so blessed building our little home together with Little A. .
.
Using pebbles and gems, she decorated the playdough house that i moulded for her. The inviting house with a simple garden allows Little A to explore the various textures of the loose parts as she added them to it. Pressing down the gems & pebbles, she also noticed the imprints made while exploring the ridges and bumps with her fingertips.
.
.
After it was done, she said “Mummy, this is the candy house!”. Oh yes, she recalled the Hansen & Gretel book that we read before. Good job Baby! 👏🏻
.
.
The house wasnt perfect, but it was the best in our eyes. 😊
