YOUR WANDERING ROOT â €
If one studies our sacred anatomy, there are many parallels with nature to be found - The Vagus Nerve, which runs from our brain stem to many vital organs and the bottom of our diaphragm, strikes an uncanny resemblance to the roots of a tree. In many ways it is, because it helps to govern the Parasympathetic Nervous System to help us Rest and Digest. Uploaded under IGTV is a new guided tutorial on Sama Vritti or Box Breath for you to cultivate calm and clarity by stimulating the Vagus nerve. Hope you enjoy.
