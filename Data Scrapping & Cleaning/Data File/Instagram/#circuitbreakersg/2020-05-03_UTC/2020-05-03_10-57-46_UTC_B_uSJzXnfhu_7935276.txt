This #circuitbreakersg motivated me to start sourdough baking. From simple no-knead sourdough to getting into real stuff, starting a sourdough starter! With daily discard, it’s a waste and I have learnt to make full use of it! From pancakes to brownies and herb crackers. They are so yummy. The crackers will be something I’m going to make often! Can’t wait to bake my first real sourdough! #sourdoughbaking #sourdoughdiscard #sourdoughdiscardrecipes #sourdoughdiscardpancake #sourdoughdiscardbrownies #sourdoughdiscardcrackers #topwithcinnamon
