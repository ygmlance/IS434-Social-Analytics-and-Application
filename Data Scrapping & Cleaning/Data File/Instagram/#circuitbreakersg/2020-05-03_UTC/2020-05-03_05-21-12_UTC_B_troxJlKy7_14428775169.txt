Reusing the #underwaterdiorama box that the kids and us had created, we created a #dinosaurdiorama ! 🦖🦕🌋🦖🦕. This is inspired by a mummy who asked us if we have an exploratory box for dino diorama. Use the same box that we sent you for all sorts of imaginary play! This time round, we make use of egg cartons and newspaper. Reuse the box as many times as you can, save the 🌍! #reducereuserecycle♻️ A youtube video 📽 is coming up on the making of the dino diorama. Support by subcribing to our channel, link in website, found in bio ⬆️. #cospacious
