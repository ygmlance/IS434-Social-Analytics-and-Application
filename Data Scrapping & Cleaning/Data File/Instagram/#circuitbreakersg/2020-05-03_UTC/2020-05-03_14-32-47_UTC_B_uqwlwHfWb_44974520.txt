Took a hike into the reserve #sungeibuloh today.... and with the #circuitbreakersg during this time, the reserve is really so so quiet... nature was able to take it’s course... the #orientalpiedhornbill family was out in force... they were just 8ft away and although they knew my presence... it didn’t bother them at all... the father was in the foreground rubbing his bill on the tree trunk display his majestic crown... as if to warn you of his presence... and protecting his family while  that the junior is being fed by the mother bird... #letnaturetakesitscourse
