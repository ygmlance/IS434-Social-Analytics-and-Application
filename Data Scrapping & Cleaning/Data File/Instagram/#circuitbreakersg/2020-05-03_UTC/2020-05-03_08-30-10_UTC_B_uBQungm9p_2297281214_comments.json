                "text": "@janolyons Ok so here goes...\n- mash four small very ripe bananas\n- add 3/4 Fuji apple chopped into small cubes\n- add two beaten eggs - add half a teaspoon of baking powder\n- add about 1/3ish of a cup (may have been a little more as I love butter) of melted unsalted butter. I used salted butter and it was a tad sea salt sweet kinda flavour. The loaf would then go well served warm and with vanilla ice cream on top with a drizzle of caramel.\n- I added about 1-2 teaspoons of Lakanto cos the bananas I had weren't too sweet but you might want to omit this if bananas are very ripe - add a sprinkle of cinnamon (maybe half a teaspoon)\n- I can't recall how much coconut flour I actually used as I just added tablespoon by tablespoon until it looked like thicker than toothpaste consistency. I think if I were to guess maybe somewhere between 3/4 to 1 cup of coconut flour. Just eyeball until it's gooey enough\n- mix well with a fork\n- I put the mixture into two small lined mini loaf tins\n- into the 180 degree preheated oven for maybe 30ish minutes. I checked with a skewer at 25minutes and let it go back in for another 5minutes to brown the top a little more.\n- most of the recipe is really eye balling the amounts until you get the right consistency and it was actually my first time using bananas in a coconut flour loaf so it may need some tweaking. Haha. I had leftover bananas that needed to be used up! The loaf turned out lovely and moist. \nEnjoy! \u2764\ufe0f",
