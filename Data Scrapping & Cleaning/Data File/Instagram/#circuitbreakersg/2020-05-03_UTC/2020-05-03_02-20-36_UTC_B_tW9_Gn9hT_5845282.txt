O’ tis sweet child of mine, he was about to turn in for nap and he requested for a pair of scissor, paper and pencil. I asked, what for? He said he wants to draw a heart ♥️ for me. Awwww.. my heart instantly melted. When he woke up from his nap, the first thing he asked for was his stationaries. You mean you went to bed still thinking about the heart shape? I gave him the stationaries. He was frustrated because he couldnt draw the perfect ♥️ shape. I held his hand and drew a imperfect one. He was beaming while cutting it out and pasted the flower I drew on the heart shape. To him, it was perfect and my heart was smiling.😀
