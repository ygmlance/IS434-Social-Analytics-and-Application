So apparently PUZZLES are super popular at the moment during the CB. 
I am not a puzzle fan but these even tempt me to help with #cabin fever! So I have ordered some which will be in SG by May 12 ( apparently 🤞). I had a flurry of interest on my FB page and have now ordered more. 
2 designs - Katong Shophouses  or Sg Sunset  Skyline. Both so cute.
500 pieces $59 
1000 pieces $85 + $15 delivery as I can’t post these with the prepaid registered post sachets I use. 
Please visit my website ( link in bio) go to Shop and then GIFTS . Scroll to bottom of page and you will see them 😍📷🇸🇬
