After watching @hakkapang @chef_pang ‘s @cnainsider feature 😂 literally arranged to order within the week for my parents as I know they will appreciate some rare Hakka food🥰⚠️FYI: the following feedback are from my parents as they tried their share of Hakka traditional food before, compared to first timer me⚠️
...
my mum was impressed that they serve #mugwortkueh ($10, 3 per box) as its hardly seen in markets anymore, it has medical properties and a strong unique taste that will intrigue fellow foodies☺️ *comments from mum and dad: there is room for improvement as it’s too sticky and lacking in shape and skill of form but they very much appreciate that someone is still out there making this👍)
...
The leicha ($8/set min 3 orders) major approval by parents given to the herbal tea soup 🍵🤩 the rice can be more fragrant *parents comments* they compared it with a small hidden shop in people park and another at fortune centre 😂 they love the additional attention to ingredients like the kidney beans👏
...
Overall, I greatly appreciate @chef_pang for continuing the Hakka food legacy😎 really motivates me to learn my dad’s Teochew food asap and stop procastinating🤭
