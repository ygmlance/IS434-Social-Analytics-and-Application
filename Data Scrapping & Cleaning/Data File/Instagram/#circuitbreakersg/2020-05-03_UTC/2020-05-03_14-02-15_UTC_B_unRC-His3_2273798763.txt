Finally made a Lemon Blueberry Yogurt Loaf that Iâ€™ve been craving for. Ultra moist and tangy,  itâ€™s a really nice cake for our summer weather. Making this cake during Circuit Breaker however did come with some challenges though. 
First of all, Greek yogurt is not easy to find at neighbourhood supermarkets these days. Secondly, I had to wait for blueberries to go on promotion lol. No way am I throwing full-priced blueberries into a cake! ðŸ˜†
