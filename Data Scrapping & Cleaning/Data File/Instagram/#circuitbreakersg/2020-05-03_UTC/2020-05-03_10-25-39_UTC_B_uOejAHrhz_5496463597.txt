Everyday we're feasting 😱😱😱 No joke... we're having fish, bakuteh, roast chicken thighs, salted veg with minced pork, sautéed mushrooms and mixed veggies with black fungi and beancurd skin. Hubby cooked the bakuteh, salted veg with minced pork, and sautéed mushrooms!

CNY = feasting few days long 🤤
CB = feasting few weeks long 😝
