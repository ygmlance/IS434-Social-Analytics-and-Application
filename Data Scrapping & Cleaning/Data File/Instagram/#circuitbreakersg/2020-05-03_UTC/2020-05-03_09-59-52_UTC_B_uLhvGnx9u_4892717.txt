Day 27 #circuitbreakersg .
It’s my mum’s birthday and i made her a turnip cake. I didn’t want her to take too much sweets, but a birthday wouldn’t be complete without a cake right? So i stayed up till 4am to steam and cool down this baby. I blame it on poor time management. Started the whole process at midnight and didn’t expect steaming to be an hour!
.
But what mattered was everyone gave the thumbs up! The hubs and Big K were literally fighting over it! .
