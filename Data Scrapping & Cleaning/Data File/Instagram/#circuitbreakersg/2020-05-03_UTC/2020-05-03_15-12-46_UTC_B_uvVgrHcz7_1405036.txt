Day 27.

Thankful to my bundle of joy as she turns 3. It’s very hard to bundle her now. She’s active and happy!

Thankful that she is healthy and generally easy to care for. May she grow up to be a loving person who will contribute positively to the society!

I’m also thankful to @artemis.sg for this cake as they accepted my request to draw a sheep on it! Kaitlyn saw her cake and said “baa baa black sheep!” We are so grateful as it’s harder to get cake these days!

What are you grateful for today?
