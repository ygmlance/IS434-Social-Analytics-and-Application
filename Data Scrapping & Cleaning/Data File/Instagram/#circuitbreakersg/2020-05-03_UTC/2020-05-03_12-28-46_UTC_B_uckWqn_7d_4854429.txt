This is what my Mr Lee was doing on Labour Day. We miss having the burnt cheesecake in Kuala Lumpur. So he got the inspiration of baking cheesecake after watching YouTube. Half an hour preparation and 40 mins of baking. We stay at home so that we can bake for our loved ones. Mrs Leeâ€™s task? I shoot, I post, I eat. #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #imstayinghome #sgdaddy #sgfamily #labourdayweekend #circuitbreakersg @genevieveleewoon @mathewwoon
