This is how I spend my #sundayafternoon , #baking is so #therapeutic ! It was my 2nd attempt to bake a rustic bread , the first time was not successful, as I didn’t use #breadflour , this time round, I bought the bread flour and determined to make a good looking , tasty rustic bread! And here we have a really nice looking #bread ! 
Yeah! #ididit
