Created a daily routine during #circuitbreaker . Feels like a reset to my life, with many healthier changes in lifestyle .

Documenting my proudest achievements
1. Body clock waking up at 7ish (no, i dont need that 100 alarms anymore) .
2. Three months into 100% #Vegetarian diet with my family 😍 (i had one cheat day due to company dinner 😭) . 
3. Sleeping at 12am-1am (instead of 5am) .
4. Daily work out, self training and stretching (oh man, that's a lot of self-discipline 😂 many days i feel so lazy BUT glad i convinced myself) .
5. More quality family time. Could have done it better by stealing all my dad's recipe. Damn .

To all my friends who are working from home, jiayou 💪🏼, please take breakS as and when your body needs. Nothing is more important than your own health ❤ .

Sidenote, please follow all the #vegan instagramers. They made the food so pretty that I'm now motivated to work towards #veganism .
