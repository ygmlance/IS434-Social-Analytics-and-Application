Does life feel like it’s going at snail’s pace right now?

We spotted a snail crawling slowly from grass blade to blade, and simply sat down to watch it. The kids were fascinated and cheered each time it managed to cross over to a different blade of grass. It was such a good reminder to celebrate life’s small victories - before you know it, you’ve reached a different place from where you started. This circuit breaker journey of ours is not only physical but a mental and emotional one too. Let’s get through this day by day, one blade of grass at a time!

We will come out of this stronger.
