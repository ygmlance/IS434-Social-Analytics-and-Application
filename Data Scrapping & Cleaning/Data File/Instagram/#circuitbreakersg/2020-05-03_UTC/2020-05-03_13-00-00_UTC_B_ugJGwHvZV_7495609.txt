We did a Penguin theme today! .
For #jeromedrondronteo , we had a penguin hat craft, where the kids made their own penguin hat & danced to penguins songs. The waddled, Shake & turned like the aquatic birds. Then we learned abt the parts of the bird - beak, flippers...
. 
For #louisateo Mei Mei, we drew penguins & coloured with crayons to make a layer of “oil” or “blubber” that keep the penguins warm & dried.  After they coloured their drawings, we tried spraying with the blue water & the droplets just “rolled” off the penguins...
.
As for #charmerteo Kor Kor, Mama added a STEM blubber glove experiment for them to experience which items best keep the bird warm from the ice water...
.
Finally, they ended their day with lotsa bubbles & foam outside the balcony & glides / swim like penguins!
