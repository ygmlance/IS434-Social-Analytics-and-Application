Day 26 of the #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~
Today the cook decided to go on strike so we ordered in. Although there are many good delivery deals during this period, we always end up cooking to save cost or to tarpow if we need a quick breather outside.
.
Was craving prata and curry so that’s what we got. Not everything is featured here but we got 3 plain pratas, one mushroom cheese, one chicken curry and one Nasi Beriyani. Food came within 45 minutes and was still warm. Delivery guy even wished us a happy dinner.
.
The only thing which surprised us was the $7 delivery fee. Why $7 when it’s just coming from the next estate???
