Woke up early this morning and did so much cooking prep while Mr K is still sleeping away. My Sunday plans would be to make gyoza for lunch and dessert would be my childhood favourite dessert - pulut hitam (black glutinous rice). Stay tuned for the photos.

Meanwhile, I shall enjoy a quiet brekkie of chocolate cake with oh-so moist amarena cherries. This combination is simply irresistible! Yum!
