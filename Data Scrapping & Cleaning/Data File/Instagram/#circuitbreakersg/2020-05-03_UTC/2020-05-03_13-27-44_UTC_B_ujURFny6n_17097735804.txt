Day 10 iftar of #ramadan2020:
🌟Fish head curry
🌟Palak paneer
🌟Biryani rice with vegetables

Took a break from cooking today and ordered dinner from The Banana Leaf Apolo. The tender flesh of the fish, the spicy and tangy curry and the squishy tomatoes are what I love in a good fish head curry. The portions were really generous too. We ordered one serving of the biryani rice and it came packed tightly in the container.

Another craving satisfied! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
