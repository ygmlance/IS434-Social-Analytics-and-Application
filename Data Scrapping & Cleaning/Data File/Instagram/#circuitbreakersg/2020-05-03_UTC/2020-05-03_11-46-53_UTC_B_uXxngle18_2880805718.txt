𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗙𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. I don't train or diet specifically for aesthetics. But you can achieve form when you train for function. You don't have to put in inhuman levels of effort into your exercise or diet, although I would be more than happy for you if you did.
⁣
All you need is consistent, sensible effort, which is more sustainable anyway. A whole year's worth of thrice-weekly, hour-long training sessions trumps a single week's worth of every day, four or five-hour training sessions. And if you diet to cut but can't stick it out, you might as well not put yourself through that misery to begin with.

𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺? Sure, to a certain extent, just like how form follows function to a certain extent, although you would probably be better at what you train for primarily. For instance, a strongman may not have the coveted V-taper because their function requires them to be built more thickly around the midsection.
⁣
Whether you train primarily for form or function, or try to strike a balance between the two, is entirely up to you. I tend to lean in favour of function, but that's because I like being able to do things with my body like calisthenics strength moves. ⁣

Many men are after a lean frame with reasonable bulk. For that hard, chiselled look with broad shoulders and a slim waist, train to achieve a high level of relative strength. If you are strong for your weight, it usually means that you are carrying more muscles and less fat, and you should look bigger and leaner at the same time.

𝗦𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝘀 - bodyweight pull ups and dips; shoulder presses and bench presses with weights, etc. Once you can rep out a considerable number of the former or push a considerable weight on the latter, form should follow that function.
