#ceritasemalam two hours before sundown and breaking of fast had me dashing to @fairpricesg supermarket for last-minute errands. dun usually carry a shopping list, but #circuitbreakersg forced me into doing it, so that i dun hv to head here everyday! no lingering in there, it's grab-and-go while maintaining safe distancing in the supermarket. i dislike the #newnorm 😔 but hv to live with tis for now.  am sure all of us are missing the "previous normal" very much, and couldnt wait to get back on track! yes, things can only get better, inshallah...🤲🏻💙 #staycalm #staysafe #mystorysg #jaistorylifestory 030520
