Made another batch! I think Japanese cucumber taste better than Lebanese cucumber. This time let it pickle longer by an extra day. The last few times, we are it up within 24 hours! 6-7 cucumbers shrank to only barely 1 bottle. Split to 3 portions. 2 portions given to neighbours as food exchange! Hope they like it! Need to order more cucumbers!
