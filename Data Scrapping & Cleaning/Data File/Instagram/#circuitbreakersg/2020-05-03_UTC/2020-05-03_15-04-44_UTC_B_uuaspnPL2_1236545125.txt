My mum cooked this for lunch today. 咸鱼豆腐焖三层肉.

This dish holds a special place in my heart. My late grandma knows I m a very fussy eater n everytime she knows I m going over for lunch, she will cook this as I mentioned it ONCE that I like this.

It is simmered in slow cooker for many hours with fatty pork, fried tofu and chunky pieces of salted fish. The resulting gravy can make me eat 2 bowls of rice! Funny thing is, I only eat the fried tofu in this dish... Now I hope I will be able to learn this one day n teach it to my daughter next time.
