Calamari and Scallops with Pickled Cauliflower by Tessa Boersma of MasterChef Australia seasons 11 and 12. Replicated her recipe from recent episode. Evidently the contestants are so good with flavours and creativity. I'm rooting for her to be in the top 5. #circuitbreakersg day21 #MasterchefAu #ibonappetit #mylollybellykitchen #quarantineandcook #isocooking #isolationcooking #isolife
