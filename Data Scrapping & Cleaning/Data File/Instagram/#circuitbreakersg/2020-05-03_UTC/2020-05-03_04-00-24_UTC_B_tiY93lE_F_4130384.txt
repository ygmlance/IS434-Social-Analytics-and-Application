So #hzcooks attempts to cook dried pork ribs curry based on this weekâ€™s curry theme. Nothing fancy just homecook meal.
I marinated pork ribs with salt and white pepper for 30minutes before I cooked it with the curry paste. Then, I add in potatoes and cook until meat is tender and potatoes are cooked and soft. Lastly, add thick coconut milk and cook to just a boil. My sisters approved! #cbfoodiesg #hzfooddiary
