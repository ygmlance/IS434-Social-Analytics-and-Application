To satisfy the hub's craving for seafood ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚úì Seafood Aglio e Olio üçù

I use:
1. Spaghetti (pasta)
2. Reg legged prawns
3. Korean flower clams
4. Japanese scallops
5. Salt
6. Minced Garlic
7. Spring Onion
8. Red chilli flakes
9. McCormick Garlic, Herb, Black Pepper & Sea Salt All Purpose Seasoning
10. Extra Virgin Olive Oil

I cook:
1. Cook the pasta in boiling water and stir occasionally until it softens. Remember, the water must be well-salted.
2. Pan fry the deshelled prawns and remove them once they change color. I added McCormick Seasoning to enhance the flavour. 
3. Pan fry the flower clams with garlic and spring onion.
4. Drain the pasta once it is ready and toss it in the pan with garlic. Then, add the cooked prawns and flower clams. 
Remember to only use extra virgin olive oil for this dish!
