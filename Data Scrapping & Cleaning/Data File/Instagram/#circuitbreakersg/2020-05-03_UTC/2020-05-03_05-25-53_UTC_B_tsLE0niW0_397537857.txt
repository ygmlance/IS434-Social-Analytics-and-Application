#CircuitBreakerSG D-27
Waking up to some big breakfast or rather brunch on a no-alarm Sunday.

Having grilled thick toast sandwich with cheese & @AyamBrandSG Spicy Tuna. Serve with crispy hash browns, greens & strawberries. Fuel up with some Nespresso compatible Coffee from @LorEspressoSG.

Happy Sunday!
