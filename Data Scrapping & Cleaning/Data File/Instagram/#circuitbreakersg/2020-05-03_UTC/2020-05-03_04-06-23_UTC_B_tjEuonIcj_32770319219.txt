"A virtual platform to appreciate the arts, no matter the times."
.
SEASON 4 of our Singapore virtual arts festival is here >>> https://www.apart.sg/featured-season-4 (Link via bio @apart.sg)
.
Today would have been the last day of #circuitbreaker… until it got extended for another month. We felt the nation’s heart sink with a big collective sigh.
.
Fortunately, a couple of our top music and theatre companies have unlocked their archives to share some of their greatest hits and we’re proud to feature some of the best. Some will entertain you for hours, while others deal with important themes like xenophobia, familial duty, and the pain of having to put our plans for the future on hold – all issues that are close to our hearts this week.
.
Hang in there. We think that the end is in sight, and besides, we heard we’ll be able to have bubble tea again soon. Stay safe. Stay together.

Follow us on our social media channels to be notified of exciting updates as soon as they happen. Be a part, and stay tuned each week!
