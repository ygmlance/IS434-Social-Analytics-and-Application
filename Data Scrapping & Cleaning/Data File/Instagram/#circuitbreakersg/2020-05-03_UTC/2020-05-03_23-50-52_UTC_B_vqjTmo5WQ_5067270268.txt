SENSING SIDEAWAYS (SOMATICS)⠀
One thing I miss the most about being under quarantine / circuit breaker is not being able to be in the pool. I end off every aqua yoga class by giving each student a 1-on-1 Watsu-inspired spinal wave. Supported by the buoyancy of the pool water, the spine feels fluid, floaty and really quite divine. ⠀
I developed this standing variation to cultivate more connection with lateral flexion when I noticed my tendency to approach standing side stretches in a muscular / mechanical way. ⠀
TIPS: ⠀
1. Start with a gentle swaying motion, starting from the crown of your head. The rest of your spine simply follows. ⠀
2. Let your head follow a continous S path, like a snake. You may find that along the 'bend' one heel lifts, and your body tips more to the opposite side. ⠀
3. If you have difficulty sensing the movement, closing your eyes may help.
