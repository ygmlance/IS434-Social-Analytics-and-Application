Finally got some time to try the new trend.. ðŸ§€Basque Burnt Cheesecake

Texture could have been better, think I mixed the batter for too long, was still jiggly but wanted it to be more jiggly heh. Was quite yumz though. First time tasting burnt cheesecakes too!

Just a lil piece of good news, weâ€™ve start taking in Pre Orders so if you would like, you could start placing your orders through DM ðŸ˜Š weee.

Self Collection/Delivery will be from 12th May onwards! ðŸ˜±ðŸ¤©
