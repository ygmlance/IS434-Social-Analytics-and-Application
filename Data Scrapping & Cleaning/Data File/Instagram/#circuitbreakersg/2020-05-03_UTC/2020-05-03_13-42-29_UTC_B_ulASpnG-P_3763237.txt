🥩Do you love your steak sous vide?🥩⁣
We pan fried our ribeye with a little @woodlandtruffles white truffle oil 👍🏻👍🏻( their products are really yummy if you like the taste of truffles!) and steak seasoning for 2.5mins on each side. Steak was about 2cm in thickness. You’ll get em medium rare😋⁣
⁣
As for the tenderloin, we decided to sous vide them using @anovaculinary for 45mins at 130F and sear it over the pan for 45secs each side👌🏼 Middle was just the way we wanted it- medium rare⁣
