🍚Day 27/56•StayHome Dinner 
All I wanted was Bittergourd Egg 😆 but none of them like bittergourd ... So I fried a 1 egg version for myself & fried chai poh omelette for them. Together with airfried wings, stirfried shiitake & spinach soup...Sunday Dinner is served! 
Hope you had a yummy dinner too! 😉
