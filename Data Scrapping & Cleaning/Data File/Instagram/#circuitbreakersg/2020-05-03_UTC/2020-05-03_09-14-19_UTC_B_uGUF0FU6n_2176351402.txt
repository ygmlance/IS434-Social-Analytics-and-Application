Lunch for today is Soy sauce chicken with fragrant chicken rice and bean sprouts. The rice use butter, shallot, garlic, lemongrass to pan fried before put in rice cooker, so it very yummy. Soy sauce chicken is very tender, juicy and tasty as well.
Well balance with some veggie ( bean sprouts stir fried with mushroom and carrot)
