°•○● BAKLAVA ●○•°
There are so many different types of baklava out there. Some chefs use pistachios or walnuts, here I'm using  almonds. 
This recipe for baklava combines all my favorite things about cooking — a helpful shortcut, a small ingredient list and no skimping on the sugar. If you don’t already know me, you will learn that I love saving time and effort in the kitchen. 
For this recipe, you will use my rolling method to skip some of the manual labor. When I created this easier version, I didn’t realize how dangerous it was going to be to have baklava on the table so fast! .
