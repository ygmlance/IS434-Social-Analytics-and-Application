STRETCH TO SORT YOURSELF OUT⠀
In fiery vinyasa yoga classes it's not uncommon to see people skipping savasana, leaving before last few minutes of the 'cool down'. ⠀
Allowingyour cardiovascular system transition from active to restorative state is important, and this is what the 'cool down' asanas and savasana does. Allowing your static muscles to stretch also reduces build up of lactic acid so you recover faster. ⠀
⠀
Here's a short sequence I often incorporate in the flows I teach that covers spinal flexion, extension + twists: ⠀
1. Wind relieving pose ⠀
2. Supine gentle twist ⠀
3. Figure 4 stretch + extended bottom leg (optional) ⠀
4. Figure 4 twist. ⠀
After this it's nice to finish off with happy baby, and/or asana / movement of your choice depending on what your body needs (headstand, shoulderstand, bananasana etc.)
