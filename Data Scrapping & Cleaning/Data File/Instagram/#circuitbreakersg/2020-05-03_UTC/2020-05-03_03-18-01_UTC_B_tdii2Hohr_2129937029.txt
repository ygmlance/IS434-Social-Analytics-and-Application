Itâ€™s a Sunday. Itâ€™s starting to get easy to lose track of the days although it hasnâ€™t been one month into the circuit breaker period ðŸ˜… We also realized that our artworks are starting to get increasingly colourful. Maybe weâ€™re trying to free ourselves through colours while having to stay at home nowadays. The palm trees are intentionally placed at where they are to cover the mouldy patches on our watercolour paper ðŸ˜† (Artwork by Art Senze).
