Today dinner I cook something I wish to cook for sometime ~ Thai basil leave chicken. Outside basil leave chicken always so salty, for this one is just nice~ I also add baby corn and french beans which outside normally is just chicken and basil. Thai style fried egg have to use a lot of oil to deep fry, at home our oil is healthy and no reuse. Thai meal will not be complete without tom yum soup~ 
For kid, the basil leave chicken will be without chilli and their "tom yum" is actually lemongrass chicken soup.
