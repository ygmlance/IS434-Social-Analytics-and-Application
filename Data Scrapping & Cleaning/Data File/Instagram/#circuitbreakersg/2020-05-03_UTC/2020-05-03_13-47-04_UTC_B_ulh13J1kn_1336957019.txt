Exploring the back alleys and canals of Hamburg a couple of summers ago.
.
The Speicherstadt in Hamburg ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª is the largest warehouse district in the world where the buildings stand on timber-pile foundations, oak logs, in this particular case. It is located in the port of Hamburg-within the HafenCity quarter-and was built from 1883 to 1927.

Today, Iâ€™m revisiting the #warehousedistrict from home via Hamburg.com (theyâ€™ve a virtual tour thing going on on their site) from the comfort of my couch ðŸ›‹
.
Guess this is the new era and way of travelling.
