【Recipe】Wow, this turned out way better then I expected it😍😋 Slow roasting a whole chicken in tangy spicy tomato gravy, result in one of the most tender and delicious one pot chicken I’ve made to date. 真的很棒👏🏻 #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
Using both fresh and canned whole tomatoes, fresh chilli and a touch of cream. And letting the chicken’s essence slowly blend in as it braise together. 
Oh yes I also boiled some bak choi, then drizzled with shallot oil, aged balsamic and soy. Sprinkle with crispy galic chips and shallots. 
You can catch me cooking this in my IGS. Simple steps, big flavours! #honeybeeroastschickeninspicytomatogravy
