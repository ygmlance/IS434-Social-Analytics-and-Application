Good morning, finally we have reached the 28th day of Circuit Breaker. Continue to stay home and stay safe. 👍👍👍 Wishing all students a fruitful last day of HBL before embarking into their early June holidays. Though nothing fanciful this school holidays, do use this time to rest and develop a hobby.

Parents, we know it is not easy to work from home and care for the children at the same time, but press on and enjoy the added bonding which we did not have previously.

Swim Safe, Swim Happy.
