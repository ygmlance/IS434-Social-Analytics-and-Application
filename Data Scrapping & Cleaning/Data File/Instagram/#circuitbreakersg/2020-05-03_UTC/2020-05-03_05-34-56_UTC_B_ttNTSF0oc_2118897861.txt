Last week of LOA has been fruitful. Decided to sign up for middle splits class with @nitajs though warm ups stretches and some conditioning excuses were tough I managed to pull thru. My joints and muscles aren't that stiff anymore. In fact my range of motion for my workouts has improved tremendously, and after 1week of class and look what I have achieved! 😍😍 Can't wait for part 2 of class next week. Thank you @thebrassbarre and @nitajs for the wonderful series
