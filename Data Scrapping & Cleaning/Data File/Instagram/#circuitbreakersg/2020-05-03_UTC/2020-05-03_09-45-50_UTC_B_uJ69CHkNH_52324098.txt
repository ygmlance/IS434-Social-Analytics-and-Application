This might look like an ordinary birthday cake, but it was made with so much heart and soul by Mini-me for her ‘Kor Kor’ big brother, The Carnivore.
.
She suffered burns, near tears and frustration but her finish cake was flawless. Her brother’s favourite - Crunchy base Chocolate with a Coffee frosting. I took one bite and thought, ‘Lana Cake Shop’ this was most delicious a Chocolate cake could be.
.
It’s a week before his birthday, but he’s in camp so celebrations for both his birthday and Mother’s Day was brought forward.
