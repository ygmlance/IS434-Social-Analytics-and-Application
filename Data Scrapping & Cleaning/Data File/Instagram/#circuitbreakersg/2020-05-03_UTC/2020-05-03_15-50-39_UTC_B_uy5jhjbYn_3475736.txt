Day 27 of circuit breaker, Sunday is relaxing day for Leodys. As I was watching a @bbcearth ducklings jumping off a tree video, he came in and joined me. He then started to keep laughing and laughing at the video. After that, we watched quite a number of times, Leodys did not want me to switch video. I actually like to show Leodys BBC animal video as it talked about real animal. Felt that he can at least learn from these videos. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #laughingbaby #bbcearth #mandarinducks #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
