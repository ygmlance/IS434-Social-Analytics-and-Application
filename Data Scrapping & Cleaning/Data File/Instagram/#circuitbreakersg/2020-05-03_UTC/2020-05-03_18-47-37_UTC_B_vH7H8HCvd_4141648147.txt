As the world soldiers on with varying degrees of quarantine and isolation measures. My country has been in the past month in a “lock-down”. Inspired by everyone around the world, running marathons in their apartments, running ultras in their backyards; I set out to clock a mileage of 400km in the 30 days of our “circuit breaker” lock-down. 
My work has prevented me from running as much as I would have liked. And it’s been almost 6 months since my last training cycle. I was apprehensive about how I would be able to hit the mark of 400km.

Nonetheless, I always believe “never know if you don’t try”. #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker
