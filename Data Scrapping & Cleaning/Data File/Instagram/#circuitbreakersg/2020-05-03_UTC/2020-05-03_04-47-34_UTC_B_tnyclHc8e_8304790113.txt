[Day 21] Funtime Challenge Theme: Hedgehog ðŸ¦”
.
.
Learning through play! Little A learnt some fun facts about hedgehog through our Funtime Challenge. It is such a fun activity, great for developing those fine motor skills/hand-eye coordination and is so easy to make. .
.
Make the hedgehogs rounded body using the playdough and push the toothpicks into the hedgehogs back to make the spikes! You may also replace the toothpicks with straws, pasta or pipe cleaners. .
.
For an additional bit of fun, give your little ones tweezers or tongs and tell them to take the spikes out using only the tweezers or tongs!

Fun facts: â€¢ A baby hedgehog is a hoglet. â€¢ They have poor eyesight, but excellent senses of smell and hearing. â€¢ Hedgehogs are nocturnal animals, often sleep during the day in a nest or under bushes and shrubs before coming out to feed at night. â€¢ Hedgehogs have about 5,000 to 6,500 spines at any one time.
