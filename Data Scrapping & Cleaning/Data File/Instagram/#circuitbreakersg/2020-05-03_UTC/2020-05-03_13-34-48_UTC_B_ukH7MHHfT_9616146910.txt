The third and final recipe in this series would be the Fuss Free Fried Macaroni that @patricoantonioâ€™s mom brought her children up with.
.

To avoid wasting the leftover macaroni, Patrickâ€™s mom used to whip up these little quick fixes for the family. Sheâ€™d typically make use of whatever was in the fridge, and serve this within a couple of minutes. .

If youâ€™re a fan of the richness of cream sauces, fret not. The recipe shared on Community Circuit Breakerâ€™s Facebook page can be done with both red sauce or white sauce. My preference? Iâ€™d recommend giving both versions a try as theyâ€™re equally good. Feel free to leave us a DM if youâ€™re keen on an in depth step-by-step for this versatile dish. .

We hope that by sharing these recipes with you, you get to make your own versions of these dishes during the #circuitbreakersg period and have something to enjoy. Happy cooking, friends! ðŸ˜„
