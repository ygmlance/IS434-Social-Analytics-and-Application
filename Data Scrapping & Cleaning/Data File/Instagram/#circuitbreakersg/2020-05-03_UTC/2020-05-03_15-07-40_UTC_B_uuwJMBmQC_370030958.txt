Nasib macam kentang. Or in English, Luck like potato. Who the bugger that came up with such classy idiom remains a mystery. 
Potatoes contain significant amounts of fiber. Fiber helps lower the total amount of cholesterol in the blood, thereby decreasing the risk of heart disease.

Remember guys. Potatoes. Not french fries.

Other well known potato phrases includes jiak kantang, couch potato , hot potato... I canâ€™t think of anything else. Are there anything else? Tell me.
