Tina Brooks - Back To The Tracks, 1960. Slated for release as part of Blue Note’s 4000 series this title was surprisingly shelved. It’s one of the more all-rounded recordings of hard bop to me. #tinabrooks and #bluemitchell up front with the horns back by #kennydrew #paulchambers and #arttaylor. The interplay is smooth and intelligent, the music lively and crisp. Tina did not record many albums as lead, so he is certainly worth exploring. Totally underrated for some reason.  #backtothetracks #bluenoterecords #jackiemclean
