#day27 of #circuitbreakersg : If you saw my insta story, you would have know i baked a chocolate sponge cake. So the goal in mind was a birthday cake for a sweet little girl. How can birthdays be without a cake, isnt it?
.
Its been donkey years since I #homebaked a layered cake so I didnt dare promise to deliver a cake. Only when it was successful, I then confidently told the mother I have a cake for her girl ðŸ˜‚
.
So proud of myself. Ha! .
