#unadon for lunch today! Bought this huge slab of unagi from @9sseafood and it was so easy to reheat and make into a Japanese lunch. Added avocado and an #onsenegg to a bowl of Japanese rice. Also made #misosoup on the side. The adults had proper miso soup made with dashi but I prefer B drinking bone broth so his is a little miso mixed with bone broth, assorted mushrooms, tau pok & spinach. #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeandcook #singaporecooking #homecooking #9sseafood #unagi #unagidon #japanesefoodlover #eatingathome #stayhome #kidsmeal #whatmykideats
