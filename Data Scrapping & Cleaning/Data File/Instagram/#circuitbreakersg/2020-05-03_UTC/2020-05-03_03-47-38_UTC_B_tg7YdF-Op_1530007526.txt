🥕🥕🥕🆇︎🅾︎ 🄲🄰🅁🅁🄾🅃 🅲︎🅰︎🅺︎🅴︎ for brunch on Day 27 CB. Who can say no to these crunchy, explosive, golden nuggets of happiness tossed in an umami sauce? This took abit of effort to make but the result was totally worth it!😋 Instead of making fried carrot cake the usual way, I decided to coat them in a mixture of flour, starch and baking powder first to crisp up the exterior. Drain off the excess oil on a paper towel.

Stirfry some garlic in a bit oil, add beansprouts to soften up a bit before adding the XO sauce. I also added a bit of sambal chilli for extra kick. Toss in the fried carrot cake cubes quickly to coat through with the sauce. Serve with chopped spring onions and parsley🥬.
