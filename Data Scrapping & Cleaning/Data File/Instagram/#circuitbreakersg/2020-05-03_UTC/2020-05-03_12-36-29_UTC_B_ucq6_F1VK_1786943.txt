A nice refreshing drink during the day - especially with the sourness to kick you back into action! Use some of the leftover strawberry compote (see matcha strawberry latte post) and add in a few slices of lemon. 
Top up with generous amounts of ice and sparkling water. You can also use carbonated soda if you want something heavier. 
I froze an entire strawberry in one of the ice balls, so that I get a nice surprise when i'm drinking! I also tend to leave my drinks aside for quite a long time, so the ice would've melted by then haha!
