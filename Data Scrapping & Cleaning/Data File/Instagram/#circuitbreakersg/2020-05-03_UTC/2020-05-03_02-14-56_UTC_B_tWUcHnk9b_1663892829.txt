My lastest Youtube video - Homemade Nando's Style Vegan Masala Macho Peas - LINK to video in BIO 
I was surprised by how easy it was to make and how delicious this Macho Peas turned out. Especially when I am not even particularly fond of peas to start with! When Nando's released their recipe for their popular Macho Peas recently, I was inspired to make my own version of it and also to use up the bag of frozen peas that had been lying in my freezer for the longest time because nobody in my family is fond of peas! 
I must confess that I have never tried Nando's Macho Peas, a side dish available in their restaurants in many parts of the world but not in Singapore. So I had to use my imagination to create it with an Asian twist - turning it into a Masala Macho Peas. The result? My wife, daughter, and I loved it! We were surprised by how much we enjoyed it especially since we are not fans of peas. The garam masala blend gave it a spicy kick whilst the peas added sweetness to it. Surprisingly good! I enjoyed it so much that I am planning to try making it again and more different versions of it until I finish using up the big bag of frozen peas I have in my freezer! :-) I liked it for practical reasons too, it was easy to prepare, takes only 5 minutes and easy to wash up after. Go try it! Have fun, enjoy!
