Circuit Breaker Day 27 // Good afternoon! G announced loosening up some of the restrictions from 12 May onwards, and the hairdresser will be open! Mr Bear's hair got so long that even he who is always lazy to cut his hair couldn't stand it anymore. He asked for help to cut his fringe and sideburn a few days ago, but I wouldn't dare say I have done a good job. 🙊

Cooked laksa using @primataste laksa paste, but not as good as I have remembered it to be.

病毒阻斷措施第27天 // 政府昨天宣布會從5月12日開始放寬一些限制，包括允許理髮店恢復營業。理髮現在真的很需要啊～熊先生這個經常懶得剪頭髮的人（他可以拖到兩個月才剪一次），都已經受不了他那頭亂草了，前兩天還要求我幫他修劉海，我只能胡亂剪一剪了。

午餐吃叻沙，用調理包煮的，不過沒有很滿意，就不介紹了。
