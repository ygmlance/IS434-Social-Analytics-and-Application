| CB ~ d27 | #homemade spanish #tapas.
HOLA! Is it Tapas time yet?. Typically enjoyed in Spain after the hours of eight, we prefer an afternoon Tapas sesh instead.
Today I prepared our Spanish favourites from my Homecooked Small Plates series. You can see the rest of what I whipped up previously - from Grazing Platters, Spanish Paella, Shakshuka, Vietnamese to Mexican - pinned under IG Highlights: '#HomeTapas 1, 2 and 3'.
.
So here's a view of today's #homecooked Spanish quartet, that I served on Organic Puffed Rice Crackers for a light and easy crunch:.
.
ü¶ê Gambas al Ajillo -.
saut√©ed chopped shrimp w/ garlic, chilli and Truffle Oil. The tiger prawns were bought in the morning, so fresh and sweet !
üçÑ -Champi√±ones al Ajillo -.
Spanish garlic mushroom with Italian sweet basil. I used baby portobello cos' I love the texture and how it soaks up the rich garlicky flavour.
ü¶ë Fried Calamari -.
lightly battered crispy squid rings, dusted with chilli and curry leaves for an Asian flavour, served with #homemade Horseradish Aioli. So yummeh.
üçÖ Spanish Pan con Tomate -.
I used the leftover Italian Truffle Oil, Sweet Basil & Tomato Bruschetta that I made on Labour Day.
.
Accompanied with:.
Sicilian Olives - again, not in frame but so fresh and sweet, my fave. I will try and take a pix of them one day.
