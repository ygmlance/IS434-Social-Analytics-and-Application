The Mister causally talked about his favourite #EggsBenedict yesterday. Then I thought, why not home-bake some English muffins (doesnâ€™t require baking lor) and make American breakfast today. And then, I did.

Eggs benny, Bacon & Egg JzMuffin ðŸ¤£ on this cosy rainy morning. Why not?

Recipe for English Muffins adapted from https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/english-muffins-recipe with modification and using bread machine.

Ingredients for Hollandaise Sauce
(enough for 4 half muffins) ::
2 egg yolks
1 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
100g melted butter
1 tsp Dijon mustard 
Pinch of salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper
1 tbsp water

Method for sauce (water bath / double boil) ::
Whisk everything together in a pot, except melted butter.

Cook over simmering pot of water, whisking continuously.

Add in melted butter slowly while whisking.

Whisk until the sauceÂ thickens. If sauce gets too thick, adjust the consistency by adding hot water bit by bit, whisking until you get the consistency you like.
.
Method for poached eggs ::
Boil and simmer a pot of water. Use a pot big enough to poach all eggs together.

Crack egg (room temperature) into a small bowl and set aside.

Add some vinegar into simmering pot of water. Use chopstick, create a swirl and pour egg into pot gently. I used a shallow sieve to gather all the egg whites towards the yolk. Continue with the rest of the eggs.

After whites are set, remove with a shallow sieve and place on kitchen towel to drain water.
.
Assemble on toasted English muffins. Spread butter, lay bacon, poached egg and pour Hollandaise sauce over. Sprinkle some black pepper and Italian herbs.
.
VoilÃ  and Bon AppÃ©tit!
