How I spend my only free time just now: •Getting ready for a nap
•Went to play with fringe extensions •Started putting dried flowers on my head
•Took our DSLR
•Started shifting my mini space for a mini photoshoot.
•Took our my tripod and getting ready with the angle and where I’m supposed to stand.
• Fixed the camera and adjusted the settings.
•Obtained the final photo and felt so disappointed that I didn’t look nice and wasted my time taking an ugly photo.
• Went ahead time edit with filter and my ugly pimple
•Uploaded the photo with a sweaty shirt.
