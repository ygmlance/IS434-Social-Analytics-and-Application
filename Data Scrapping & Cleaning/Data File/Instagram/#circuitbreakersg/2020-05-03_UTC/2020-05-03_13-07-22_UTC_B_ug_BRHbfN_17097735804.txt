Sharing the recipe for #ayamgorengberempah

We didn’t have any curry leaves, which would have made the fried chicken even more flavourful. So, we added more meat curry powder instead.

The addition of lime juice was a spur-of-the-moment decision, and it proved to be a right one. The spiced fried chicken wings were gently lifted with the tangy lime flavour, complementing the various spices and making the fried chicken less “jelak”. I think I’ll be doing that to my fried chicken marinade in the future!
