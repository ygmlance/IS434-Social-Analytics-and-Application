🕖Dinner:
-Sautéed celery with huge arse prawns
The flavor and crunchy texture of celery is fabulous in so many dishes. It’s how magical that we can just turn this two ingredients, prawn and celery into a fabulous healthy dish that reminds how easy and great cooking can be -Double boiled mixed mushroom chicken soup.
-Steamed spicy pork ribs
-Fried omelette with Toona sinensis, aka 香椿Xiāng Chūng. A popular leaf that Asian used to make asian ‘pesto’. It had its own bold and strong savoury flavour.
