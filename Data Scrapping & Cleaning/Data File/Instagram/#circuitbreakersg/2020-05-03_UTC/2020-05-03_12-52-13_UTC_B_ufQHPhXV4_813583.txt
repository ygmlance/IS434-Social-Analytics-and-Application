Tabata training for first time online with #awesomecolleagues. Thanks @nikaelacole for inviting me. .
Training properly  is hard when you are fasting. But it is all about mind over body.
.
I remembered, I trained very hard, doing SOC,  2.4 KM March,  IPPT during fasting but I endured by taking cold shower. I could see vapour on my warm body.
.
I just want to achieve healthy body, if not little bit sapau ðŸ¤­
.
If anyone want to conduct any training, yoga, cooking or so ever, count me in
