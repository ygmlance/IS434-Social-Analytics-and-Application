Dishes cooked to clear the fridge!

There has always been a debate among Thais of what recipe of fried basil minced pork is the most authentic. Some stood for recipe without any veggies. Many said it should be very dry without much gravy. Some claimed it only require fish sauce and sugar as seasonings. 
For whatever it is, food should be what the eater prefers and most happy with. So recipes can always be altered and changed.
