[#TheHedgehogAtHome/#NewRecipe] Can't go to Hong Kong? Never mind, I brought HK to my home with this homemade steamed Egg Curd Pudding with Ginger, one of my most favourite childhood desserts.
.
Personally, I don't quite like ginger by itself, but really love it when it is complemented by the eggs and milk in this pudding. Ginger is a "warm" herb and is good for people like me who always get cold hands/ feet.
.
Btw, this recipe only requires 4 basic ingredients (eggs, milk, ginger & sugar), so you can do this even without running out to the supermarket. üòä Swipe ‚¨ÖÔ∏è for more pics.
