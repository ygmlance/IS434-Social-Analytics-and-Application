Nasi Ambeng for iftar from Coba2 in Yishun! First time ordering from them. It’s pretty good 😘 In the centre you have rice topped with serunding (grated coconut) surrounded by a whole array of dishes: - prawns in green balado sauce,
- sambal sotong, - beef rendang, - sambal kacang ikan bilis (anchovies with peanuts), - sambal goreng, - paru goreng, - begedil, - telor balado, - urap, etc. - Not in photo: bowl of ayam kalio and ikan kering.

Super yummz 😍 
Can try them. Order via Foodpanda

Btw, the other day someone asked what’s the difference between nasi ambeng and nasi sambal goreng. I think one common distinction is that nasi ambeng usually has one dish that’s with gravy (in this case ayam kalio) while nasi sambal goreng is usually ‘dry’. Also, nasi ambeng has a wider variety of side-dishes including urap (which is like I guess raw veggies/salad usually eaten with sambal belachan?)
