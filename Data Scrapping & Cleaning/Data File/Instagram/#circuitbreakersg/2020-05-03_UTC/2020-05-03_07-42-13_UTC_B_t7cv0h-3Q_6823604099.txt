Today, we salute and celebrate the dedication of our healthcare frontliners, the commitment of our essential workers, the appreciation of our foreign workers, and ultimately the perseverance and resilience in every Singaporean with our music that transcends language and culture! 
From all of us in Authentico Wind Ensemble to turn on the power in Singapore!

This is our fight! Stay strong and we will be all right!
