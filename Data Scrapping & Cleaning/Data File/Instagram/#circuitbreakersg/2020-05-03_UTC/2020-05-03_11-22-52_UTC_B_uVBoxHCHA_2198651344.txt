[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Discovered another value-for-money Bento Set, this time from @PeachGardenSG. Each lunch box came with 2 desserts and a drink, all for S$9.90 nett!
.
The beef slices were surprisingly succulent and well-marinated. Even the mango sago had some fresh diced mangoes, pomelo and sago. And our desserts and drinks were double-secured to prevent spillage. 💯 effort.👍 Swipe ⬅️ for more pics (we ordered 5 sets).

PS: Pls let me know below if you have such similar good deals to recommend me! 😂
