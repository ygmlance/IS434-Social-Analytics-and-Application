Most of us experienced many â€˜firstsâ€™ over the last month of the Circuit Breaker.  Those experiences were accompanied by much frustrations:â €
â €
â–  Working from home without the most basic office furniture. â €
â–  Working from home with 3 children on home-based learning and without adequate supporting technology.â €
â–  Plans changed on a daily basis.â €
â–  Turning your home into your everyday gym with whatever equipment you can get hold of.â €
â–  Reminding your older folk to stay home instead of sneaking out whenever they could. (This was such an experience for me and I laugh every time it comes to mind.)â €
â–  Cooking or baking.â €
â–  Playing online UNO with friends via Zoom.â €
â–  Using Zoom for many. (I am so proud of my parents for learning this in such short time!)â €
â–  Group workout over Zoom.â €
â–  Reaching out and helping your friend, neighbour or even strangers.â €
â €
It is an endless scrolling list â€¦. â €
â €
26 days on, as we move into the extended month. â €
â–  How do you feel about all these â€˜firstsâ€™?â €
â–  Have they grown from frustrations to fulfillments? â €
â–  What did you learn about yourself in terms of your own capability and capacity?â €
â–  How are they useful in navigating the potentially uncertain months ahead? â €
â €
Check in with yourself and share with me if youâ€™ve become more or less confident about your capability to cope in uncertain times and how do you see yourself moving forward? â €
