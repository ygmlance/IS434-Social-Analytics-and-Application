Some of our favourite #可愛い　prints on our signature #doublegauze #fabricmasks. Some of these were on preorders earlier and immediately sold out. Many people have been asking when we are releasing new designs for preorders. Please give us more time to fulfill outstanding  orders before we start a new round of preorders in #Etsy. Thank you everyone for your patience and understanding. Have a blessed Sunday! 😍
