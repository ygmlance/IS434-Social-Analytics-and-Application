Hacked Kway Chup - Kway refers to the sheets of rice noodles. Chup literally means a mish mash of things. In this instance, itâ€™s a pot of pork belly, pork skin, eggs, bean curd, fish cakes & chicken feet braised in herbs & spices for over 2 hours. Some people add pig intestines, did not find it at my butcher. Hacked because I got inspiration from @sirrinta to use rice paper rolls for #cheechongfun & subsequently @david_yip to repurpose it for #kwaychup. #Chilli hacked using chicken rice chilli with rice vinegar, ginger paste & sugar. #DadaCooks
