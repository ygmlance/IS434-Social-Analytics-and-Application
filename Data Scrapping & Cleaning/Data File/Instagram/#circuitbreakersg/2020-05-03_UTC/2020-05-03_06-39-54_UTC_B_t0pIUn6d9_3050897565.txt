Are avocado spelt with just 's' or 'es'? My sis likes some effort in weekend breakfasts as she wakes up early. Whereas I wake up late in order to try to skip breakfast (though i get to eat her leftovers).
Avocado and scrambled egg sandwich is elevated a lot if you add red onion to the avocado. On #sourdough from @theprovidore
 Others are @bettycrocker and @emborgasia sliced vegetarian cheese.
