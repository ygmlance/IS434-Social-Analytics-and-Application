Was inspired by @paradeoflove to play with make up, though honestly I am quite bad and amature with makeup. But well, no harm trying right? 😂⠀
⠀
I picked Element Of Surprise palette from @colourpopcosmetics and followed @borsalinomia's pictorial tutorial. Well, I don't think I'm anything close to hers, but I had fun! ☺️ Thanks! And I just can't seem to capture the eyeshadow color difference on my phone camera. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Do I need a special lens or lighting for that? ⠀

Took the chance to play with a few looks with different accessories 😂⠀
➡️ 1. Casual look with cute @HelloKitty hair tie side ponytail ⠀
➡️ 2. Classy/demure look with pearl hair clip ⠀
➡️ 3. 小glam 一下 with @risisofficial Yenlin necklace⠀

好像還不錯吧～［支持一下嘛］⠀
我說的算對嗎？哈哈 🤭⠀
