When I came out from my room this morning, I saw #AaleyahRayna donned a flowery dress. I know it’s a Sunday but we have no weddings to go to, you know.. 🤣

So I decided to make it fun for the kids, I told the other two, “Let’s dress to impress! You can wear anything you want.” #RayyanAsher is missing soccer so much, thus the soccer outfit with socks and boots. 
Then came #AyeshaRuqaiyyah, it was epic. She said she wants to feeling2 Hari Raya. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣🤭 #CB #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg  #cbdiaries #circuitbreakerdiaries  #cbmodels #stayhome #staysafe #stayhomestaysafe #sgunited #sgunited🇸🇬
