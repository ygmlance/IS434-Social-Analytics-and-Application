One day, you can be a Pilot. Another day, you can be a Vet. The next day, you experience owning a sushi restaurant and the following day, a Pizza restaurant owner, thatâ€™s  dramatic play. 
This circuit breaker season, we explored dramatic play and have done five themes, mainly Vet, Supermarket, Pizza, Pilot and Sushi restaurant. 
These ideas originated when  Lucas, my 4 years old is not intrinsically motivated in doing handwriting practises. After trying out dramatic play, I realised so much benefits that it has reaped. 
We will be dropping more dramatic play ideas and resources to share this holiday so that you can try it with your little ones. They look difficult to set up but it is actually not. What you need is just a printer and materials found at home to set up dramatic PLAY at home. 
Join @bubzexplorer and I for this dramatic play scene this season! @bubzexplorer has also tried some dramatic play scene! Head over to her side to look at what she has set up!
