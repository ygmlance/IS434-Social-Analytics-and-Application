Outside can be depressing. Iâ€™m distracting myself with jewelry. Breaks up the meltdowns nicely. .

If you want to bury your head in the sand (and maybe have that sand turn to a pearl) then head over to my IGTV where Iâ€™m posting the jewelry chats from stories there. Itâ€™s filled with sparkly fun fabulous things guaranteed to cheer you up. And if that doesnâ€™t work just laugh at my general awkwardness and ill timed inappropriate humor. Oh and maybe you can find a Motherâ€™s Day gift idea too. Thatâ€™s more a reminder for me as I need to get on that! Think my mom still wants a homemade card with my footprint on it? ðŸ¤¨ Would my size 43 (US11/12) foot even fit on a card? ðŸ¤”
