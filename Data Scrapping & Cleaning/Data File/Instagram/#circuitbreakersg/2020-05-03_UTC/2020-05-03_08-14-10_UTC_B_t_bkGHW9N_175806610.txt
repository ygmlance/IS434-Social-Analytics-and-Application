🇸🇬 Circuit Breaker 
Went for the weekly gynae check up yesterday and that's the only valid reason to be stepping out from home 😉. Weight gain at this moment 11kg and we have barely 1 more month to go before meeting our little Prince ❤️. This time round the belly looks more pointed from the side as compared to my previous pregnancy. Which explains why most people has been saying, the shape of the belly could almost tell us the gender of the baby accurately.

Now I can totally relate to it after experiencing 2 pregnancies with different gender 😊. #stayhomestaysafe #circuitbreakersg
