#circuitbreakersg day 27

Made some scotch eggs with chorizo for brunch today with a side of rocket and baby spinach, cherry tomatoes, nuts and smoked salmon. 🥚 🌭 🌱🍅 🥜 🐠 .

If circuit breaker was not extended, tomorrow would have been the last day. So let’s give ourselves a pat on our shoulders for coming this far! 👍🏻 .

Since circuit breaker started, I have been cooking a lot more than before and the hubs always helps to clean up after our meals. This is what I’m grateful for today. 😊 #gratitudediary
