DAY 27 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
POHA
Breakfast in Bed is a luxury I am not going to get for a long long time, so treated myself to Breakfast in Balcony ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
It was cloudy today and I really enjoyed the poha, with a hot cup of adrak wali chai (ginger tea/ teh halia)

This is how I make poha
1. Take 1.5 cup of poha (dry flattened rice) in a big strainer. Wash it under running water for 20 sec. Leave aside for 5 min for water to drain off. Wash again for 10 sec. Leave aside again.
2. In a pot, put 5-6 tbsp oil, put a handful of peanuts. Fry for  a minute, remove, keep aside.
3. In the same oil, put one potato, diced small. Stir, and cook (on  till potato is soft. Remove, keep aside.
4. In the same pot, same oil, put 1/4 tsp of mustard seeds (raee), and 1/4 tsp of cumin seeds (jeera). When mustard crackles, put 1 small onion, chopped small, and a flake of garlic, chopped fine. 
5. Cook for a minute, and put 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp turmeric pwd (haldi), a pinch od asefoetida (hing) and a few curry leaves. 
6. Now put the poha, potato & peanuts.
7. Finish by adding some chopped coriander & green chilli, and 1/2 tsp of sugar. 
Check and add more salt if needed. 
Mix well, and serve.
