Sunday dinner was a couple of burgers! Each had a pan-fried handmade patty which was 80% minced beef with 80% lean + 20% fat, and 20% minced pork, sliced raw yellow onions, tomato slices, and were dressed with the last bit of Kausmoâ€™s BBQ Glaze and a sprinkling of freshly ground Kampot red peppercorns. Everything was sandwiched between pan garlic-buttered burger brioche from @bakerybrera Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #tomatoburger #hamburger #sundaydinner #stayathome #eatathome #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg #bakerybrera #supportlocalsg #savefnbsg
