Grilled Pork Chop with mushroom sauce to end my home cooking this long weekend! Monday will be back to simple and quick fix lunch due to work. Thank you @jessyew85 for sharing the mushroom sauce recipe. Simple and easy (just need onion, mushroom and stock) didnt have butter or cream so try it without and it thicken as well! So please with the sauce! 😋😊 #grilledporkchops #mushroomsauce #weekendlunch #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #homecookedlunch #christiecancook🍽 #sgfoodie #sgfood #christie❤food
