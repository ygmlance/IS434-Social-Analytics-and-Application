01/05/20 | CB Day 25 - Labour day fun with this magnetic tangram from @toppingskids 💕 Since it’s magnetic, it’s a perfect combi with the Momsboard.

Tangram is a two-dimensional re-arrangement puzzle created by cutting a square into seven pieces. This activity boosts and develops problem-solving and logical thinking skills! Tangram shapes can be fitted together as a large square, rectangle, or triangle and many other complex shapes! Lincoln was working on creating a flamingo and whale 🐳 Can you tell?
