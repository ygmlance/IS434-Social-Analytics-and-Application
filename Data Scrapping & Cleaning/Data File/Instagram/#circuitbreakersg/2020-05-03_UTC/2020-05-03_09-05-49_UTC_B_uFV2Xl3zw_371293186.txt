Circuit Breaker Day 27 - Last night, I saw a Vietnamese rice paper roll dish I've made in 2017 on Instagram...so I dug into my dried ingredients stock & found a pack of rice paper rolls...Have had enough high cholesterol prawns & squids & made a "warm" ingredients for the rice paper rolls wraps. Sakura minced chicken, shiitake mushrooms, orange & red capsicums, quick stir fry with fish sauce, brown sugar, Himalayan salt & pepper; then let it cool before soaking rice paper rolls into water for softening them for wrapping. Added roasted minced peanut on ingredients before rolling up the wraps. Low fat low carb lunch for a hot Sunday. Dear friends, go to supermarket, pick up a pack of rice paper rolls, shrimps, lettuce, & you can do an easy & fun meal preparation with your kids!  #estheryykitchen #mykitchen #cookstagram #homecookedmeal #cookinghobbyist #eatwithme #foodstagram #lowfats #lowcarbs #healthyfood COVID-19 #circuitbreakersg #easycooking #stayhomestayfit #eatstargram #foodiegram #vietnamesefood #asianfood #easycooking #quickfixmeal #ricepaperrolls #nomnom #越南 #春卷 #健康快餐 #炎夏
