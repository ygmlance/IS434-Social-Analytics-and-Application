Day 27 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg - 3 May 2020 - Woke up with blurred vision so I did something simple - #brunch with bits and pieces of #leftover #lobakgou from Day 23, some diced garlic, spring onion and 2 eggs (1 beaten, 1 thrown in whole because I like to see some streaks of white in the finished dish) to make my non-authentic version of a  local dish referred to as #nofilter #friedcarrotcake (even though it's radish that's used). Quite #yummy and #easypeasy way of using #leftovers but I think there are too many ingredients inside (which is why I left out the chai poh/preserved radish normally in this dish); I think I'll make a batch of fresh plain radish cake soon, to make an authentic Singaporean version where I can taste the radish more. Sometimes, more is not necessarily better. #stayhomewithascott #homecooking
