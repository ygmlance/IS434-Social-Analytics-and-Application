Day4.5.....seems a little strange .  Like there are no bubbles. Just some liquid forming on TOP... not sure if it is normal. Smell wise:
Still pleasant .... Day 4: there was also a layer of brown liquid.... if I am not wrong, it is called Hooch and is an alcohol! Unfortunately, I poured it off then I realised that I should have taken a photo!...ðŸ˜‚.................
