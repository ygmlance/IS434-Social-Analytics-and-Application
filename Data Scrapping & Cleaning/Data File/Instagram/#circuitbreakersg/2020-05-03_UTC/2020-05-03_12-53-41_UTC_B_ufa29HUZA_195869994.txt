[20.20 May 3: Circuit Breaker Day #27]

I usually steam my fishes because pan frying it tends to have the oil splatter all over. Today, everything went into my #NinjaFoodiOP300. I don't need to spend time cleaning up the oily stove!

Got my  julienned ginger Air-fried too! Drizzle the soy sauce and sesame oil mixture and serve! 🌟 Discount code: xavvyliciousninjaop300sg for 25% off at www.ninjakitchen.sg 🌟
