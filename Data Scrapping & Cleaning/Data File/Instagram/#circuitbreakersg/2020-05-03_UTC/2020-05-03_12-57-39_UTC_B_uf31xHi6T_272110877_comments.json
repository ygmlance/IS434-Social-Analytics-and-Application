                "text": "@abusybusymom For this risotto, I used 2 types of mushrooms and roasted pork belly.  So I fried these ingredients with garlic first. Then added chopped onions and fried together. Once the onions turned transparent, I added the washed short-grain rice. Intermittently, I added chicken stock to the rice. Must keep stirring then the rice grains are nearly cooked. Then add some red wine and continue stirring. When all is cooked, add a small piece of butter, pepper and salt.",
