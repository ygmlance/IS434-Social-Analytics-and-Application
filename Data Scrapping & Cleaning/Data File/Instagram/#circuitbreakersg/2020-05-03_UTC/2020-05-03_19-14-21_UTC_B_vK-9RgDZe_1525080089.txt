Sunday was a ‘blank’ day on my meal planning. Saw something really easy online & had all the simple ingredients in my fridge/pantry. Ta-Dah!! Made Mongolian beef rice bowl by #seonkyounglongest really easy to put together, yummy & kids friendly ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ #ricebowlideas #whattocook #easyrecipesathome #mealideas #homecook #eatathome #stayathomeforsg #circuitbreakersg
