|| Circuit-Breaker Week 3 • Invisible Heroes ||
.
Besides doctors, nurses, medical staffs, scientists, government official, police and army, first-liner workers also include security guards, cleaners, essential retailers and service providers. These invisible heroes and heroines risk their life, carry on with their work so that we are able to go on with a less disruptive live during this distressed period.

Our hearts are with them and most especially our prayers for their safety and protection against this pandemic. For everyone, I would like to share the whole Chapter of Psalm 121, of God's assurance which I've tried to hold on dearly to during the hardest times

I lift up my eyes to the mountains
where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
He will not let your foot slip
He who watches over you will not slumber
