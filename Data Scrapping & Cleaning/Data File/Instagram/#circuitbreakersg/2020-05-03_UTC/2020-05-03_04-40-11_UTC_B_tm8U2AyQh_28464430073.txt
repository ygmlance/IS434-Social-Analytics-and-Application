Hello everyone!🤗 We are back with some updates regarding the current Circuit Breaker measures!

1. First and foremost, the 🏁F1iS national finals🏁 have been postponed indefinitely. In place of the national finals, RGS teams will be having our very own internal finals, so do continue to give us your support!😁 2. 🕑At the moment, since businesses have  been affected due to the Circuit Breaker, we will temporarily stop✋accepting sponsorships🤝 However, previous sponsorships will be retained. Nevertheless, if you or your company is willing to provide us with a sponsorship, feel free to DM us or email📧 us at 	rgs.teamvivax@gmail.com!🤩
