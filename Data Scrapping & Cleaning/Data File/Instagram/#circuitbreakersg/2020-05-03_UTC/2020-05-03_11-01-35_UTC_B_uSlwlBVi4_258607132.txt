I am staying home with my family and enjoy my time with them.

Mee Briyani is a must for my family during Ramadhan. Every  year we will always go and get them from our favorite restaurant.

Due to COV 19,we also need to cut down on our expenses. As such, today I decided to make my own version of Mee Briyani.

Alhamdullillah. It turns out well. No more purchasing Mee Briyani for us.My kids could also have more servings as they love Mee BriyaniðŸ˜‚
