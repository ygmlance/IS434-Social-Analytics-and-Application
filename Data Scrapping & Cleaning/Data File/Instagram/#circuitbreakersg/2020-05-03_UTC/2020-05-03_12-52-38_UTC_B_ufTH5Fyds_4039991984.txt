#Circuitbreakersg Day-27, Wrap again !! Tonight - Local Popiah - fresh spring roll, missing in the pic here are tau gua and fresh mince garlic, so glad that fresh popiah skin is still available from the market 😁 really appreciate this #stayhome period where we get to “be together “ all the time, breakfast, lunch, dinner, eating, cooking, chatting, no rushing, lots of time for reflecting 😃😍#stay safe everyone
