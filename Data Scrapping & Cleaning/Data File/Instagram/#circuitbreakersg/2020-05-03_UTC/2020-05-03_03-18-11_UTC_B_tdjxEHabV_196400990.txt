Sunday Brunch, was a quick reheat of Thursdayâ€™s leftover Braised Mee Pok with Minced Pork and Mushrooms. The noodles were softer, but the flavour was deeper, due to the chives and shiitake mushrooms. Tasty! ðŸ˜‹ #braisedmeepok #leftovers #nowastedfood #nowastemeal #stayathome #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
