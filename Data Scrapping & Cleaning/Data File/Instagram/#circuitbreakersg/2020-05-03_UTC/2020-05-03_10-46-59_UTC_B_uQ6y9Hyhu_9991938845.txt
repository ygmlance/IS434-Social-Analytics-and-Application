I really love vinegar Pig’s Trotter , & this dish was cooked for myself 😆 Literally, the “猪”饭婆，during this stay home period! Cauli rice as the vege cum rice... fully contented with the aroma & taste , with ginger dried for a week & using a full bottle of sweet vinegar. Family loves it too. #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #homecookedmeal #vinegarpigstrotter #pigstrotter #caulirice #煮饭婆 #stayhome #sgparenting #momlife #sunday
