Today was part 2 of our online Learn To Letter course! We learnt simple doodles that can help to decorate our artwork.

The highlight of it all was when we had a short time of sharing. Each of us shared about our worries this period and hand letter an encouragement to ourselves. We then put the artwork into our memory box because we want to remember what this pandemic was like for us and how we overcame it!

Share with us, whatâ€™s your worry this period? We are here to listen.
