It's japanese night again today! A friend recommended the unagi, so bought 1 to try since the hub likes unagi don. For the lil one and myself, I cooked teriyaki chicken don. All served with corn and carrot soup for the "greens" coz mummy is too lazy to stir fry another veg dishðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #homecooking #sghomecooks #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday27 #japanesefood
