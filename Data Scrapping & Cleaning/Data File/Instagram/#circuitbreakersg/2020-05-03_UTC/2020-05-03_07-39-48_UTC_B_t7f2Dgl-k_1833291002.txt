pretty skies!! then u can swipe for a veryy lacklustre documentation of what i've been eating ...🥴🤤⁣
if you haven't asked me alr / guessed frm my story, i got two of my wisdom teeth taken out on wed!! since then it's just been a lot of eating mush & feeling like mush too :–( ⁣
⁣(don’t let the last vid fool u eh turns out i have to soak bread in soup for a minute to render it edible)

tbh it's been mentally challenging dealing with the notion of 'not doing enough' and recovering too slow during this period (whicH is so dumb.. sorry I KNOW) but hopefully i can feel better soon :,( ⁣
⁣
in the meanwhile! a lot of youtube projects in the pipeline ; my SD cards are either corrupted / suddenly won't cooperate with my laptop which sux so much esp during this time but when i get it settled i'll bRB oKK. sighss big ramble over, hope everyone's staying awight & safe ❄️🌊 icb it's MAY already
