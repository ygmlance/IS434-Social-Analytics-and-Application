Didn’t get our act together in time to order in sushi for lunch, so we made (Playdoh) sushi & ebi tempura don instead! 🍣🍱 😜Did a very prescient shopping spree at Popular a week before the #circuitbreakerSG was announced to create a “Rewards Bag” for the girls with new comic books, card games and this Playdoh sushi set. One month later, and it’s been depleted already with four weeks of lockdown (and no HBL) to go. Help! 😫 #sundayfunday #goodbyeHBL #stayhome #sgkids
