We survived 1 month of #circuitbreakersg .. and it was the first time my kitchen was so hardworking and so am I ðŸ˜‚! I cook at least 6 days a week, and one off day for other chores! So yes, Iâ€™m looking forward for a very intensive tunia!!! Oh ya, And we experience camping in our living room after a close 4 years! And the kids had so much fun while we are having backache ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ #kyanong #kayzelong #kyanxkayzel #familybonding
