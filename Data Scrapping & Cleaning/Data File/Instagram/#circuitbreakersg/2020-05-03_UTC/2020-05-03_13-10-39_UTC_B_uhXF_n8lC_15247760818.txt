Went for a routine check-up (never ä¹±ä¹±è·‘ ðŸ˜œ) in the area and é¡ºä¾¿did a grocery run and packed food for lunch + dinner + following dayâ€™s brunch + dinner from the three hawker stalls that are still open at Tanjong Pagar Food Centre... restocked on fresh fruits too! Bananas were going at only $1 per bunch, do help to patronise these stalls if you are in the vicinity! Every bit helps and the foodâ€™s good too. ðŸ˜Š
