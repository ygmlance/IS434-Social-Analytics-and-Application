“Making Japanese noodles ; Hiyashi Chuka 冷やし中華 because I never get sick of Japanese food.  冷やし中華 is basically chilled ramen noodles with various colourful toppings served in the summer
.
For the noodles I used somen and for sauce I mixed Ponzu sauce together with Goma sauce, mirin, soy and sesame oil. Both somen and ponzu sauce are from @naturesglorysg” .
