I've had a few questions about the eggs that I've been putting liberally on top of food to make stuff look better. These are actually really easy to do consistently - it's all in the timing.

For 4 eggs straight from the fridge (NOT room temp) I bring a saucepan of water to a rolling boil, put the eggs in, bring it down to a gentle simmer and wait 6.5 to 8 minutes depending on what degree of doneness I want. Then, they go under tap water until cool. Peel and then halve with a clean paring knife. 
These lend themselves well to becoming ramen style eggs. Just peel and then place them in a mix of mirin, soy sauce, sake, sugar and water. 1 cup each of water and sake and 0.5 cups each of the rest. Let sit for 4-12 hours; credit to @seriouseats for this recipe. 
As for getting the shells off, I'm afraid the best tip I know is to make more eggs than you need. I've tried peeling after chilling in an ice bath, peeling under running water, peeling from the wide part of the egg, but all of these basically are hit and miss. Suggestions or tips are very welcome for the peeling stage.
