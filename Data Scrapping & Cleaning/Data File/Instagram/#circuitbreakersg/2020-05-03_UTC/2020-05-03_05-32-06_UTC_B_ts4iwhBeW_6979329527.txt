We really miss telling stories of our newborn....
Can’t wait for this circuit breaker to be lifted fully. 
We hope and pray that we will be able to start operating soon. Miss our studio for sure! 😞
Oh yes, your safety is definitely our priority. 
We will clean the studio thoroughly once we have an access to it! 
We will be implementing these measures at our studio.😊 Looking forward to meet all of you soon, insyaAllah ❤️ Stay safe everyone!
