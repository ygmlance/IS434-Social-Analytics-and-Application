Featuring: Mao Shan Wang Twilly

The Mao Shan Wang (also known as Cat Mountain King or Rajah Kunyit) print is inspired by this variety’s bright yellow flesh. Durian connoisseurs love its signature bittersweet taste with its creamy and sticky texture.

These original designs, with the fruit, flowers and leaves sketched by @aftonchan, come in an explosion of colours and strong graphical elements too. The vibrant reds, bright blues, neon pinks and yellows converge and pay homage to the vibrancy and designs found on façades of shophouses, where many durian stalls in Singapore are found.
