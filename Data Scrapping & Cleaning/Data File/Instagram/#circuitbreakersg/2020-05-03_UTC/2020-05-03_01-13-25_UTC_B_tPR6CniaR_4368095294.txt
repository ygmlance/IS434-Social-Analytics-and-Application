🌧️CB Day27 - Breakfast❤️
.
Mum 👩🏻‍🦱 made her famous steam carrot cake! And she had save half of it for another day's meal as Fried Carrot Cake. .
The home-made carrot cake is always my go to comfort food 😍😍😍
.
Though I can eat it everyday, but I don't dare to ask my cutesy mum 👩🏻‍🦱 make it so often, coz it's a lot of preparation work to make this. 😜
But she probably in good mood, or she's sick of my planned menu, she decided she wants to make 萝卜糕！❤️❤️❤️
