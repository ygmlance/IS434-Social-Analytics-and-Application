Presenting Pig Sugar/G&T Teh’s ‘signature’ beverage - 𝐁𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐒𝐮𝐠𝐚𝐫 𝐁𝐨𝐛𝐚 𝐌𝐢𝐥𝐤 𝐯𝟐. First version was launched on Easter Sunday but I wasn’t satisfied with the pearls. Today’s pearls are exactly how I like it! The only thing that needs improvement is the size of the pearls. It doubled in size after cooking, so it looks like mini 粉圓 topping on Nine Fresh or Blackball desserts. 🤣⁣
