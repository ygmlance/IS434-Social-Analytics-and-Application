𝐏𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐄𝐑𝐕𝐄𝐃 𝐑𝐎𝐒𝐄 𝐁𝐎𝐔𝐐𝐔𝐄𝐓⁣
With Mother’s Day around the corner, surprise our mummy dearest with a beautiful bouquet from 𝐋𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐇𝐮𝐚 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐩 🌸🌺. Deliveries start from as low as $5 which is quite a steal, with flower variety ranging from the popular Baby’s Breath and Roses to Sunflower, Carnation and Tulips. ⁣

This Mother’s Day, gift an 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐋𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐭 $𝟒𝟕.𝟗𝟎 (𝐔.𝐏. $𝟒𝟗.𝟗𝟎) which comes with preserved rose and dried flowers for a change. While fresh flowers usually wilt after a few days, having a preserved rose bouquet makes a huge difference with its timeless beauty! 😍⁣
