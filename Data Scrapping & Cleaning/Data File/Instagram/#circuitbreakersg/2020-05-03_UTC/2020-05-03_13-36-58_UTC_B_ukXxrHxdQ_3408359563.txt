Day 27 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg ( 3 May 2020) - Got hungry on grocery run and decided to just buy something to eat for dinner on the way back instead of cooking, but I thought I should still share food pics. Here's a #nofilter #muchlatergram of some dishes I made at a cooking class in a Chiang Mai farm, while on a trip with my band mates in 2019. 1st dish is #khaosoi (a local curry noodle dish with both soft and crunchy noodles, a #musteat in wonderful #chiangmai ), 2nd is a spicy minced pork dish which I can't remember the name of, 3rd is #padkrapowgai (stir-fried holy basil chicken), 4th is #mangostickyrice , and the last was actually cooked when I returned to Singapore; #tomyumgoong wonder when we can go back again? ðŸ˜«
