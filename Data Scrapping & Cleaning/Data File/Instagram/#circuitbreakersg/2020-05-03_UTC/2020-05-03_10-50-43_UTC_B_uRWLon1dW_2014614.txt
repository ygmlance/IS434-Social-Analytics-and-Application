🐷's kitchen is closed for the #labourdayweekend, so here’s a #latergram of the fudging good brownie I baked the other day.⁣

How do you like your brownie – fudgy or cakey? For me, it’s rich, moist and fudgy brownie anytime! Very satisfied with my sinfully fudgy and gooey homebaked 𝐃𝐨𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐇𝐚𝐳𝐞𝐥𝐧𝐮𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐚 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐭 𝐁𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐢𝐞! Sounds like a mouthful I know, but every ingredient is essential in making my ultimate ideal brownie a success. And cos quality matters when it comes to chocolate baked treats, I use only two brands - @valrhonausa and @ghirardelli 🤭⁣⁣

Brownie and gelato goes well together, so I topped mine with a scoop of @alferogelato’s Bacio! So good! 🍨😋⁣⁣⁣⁣
