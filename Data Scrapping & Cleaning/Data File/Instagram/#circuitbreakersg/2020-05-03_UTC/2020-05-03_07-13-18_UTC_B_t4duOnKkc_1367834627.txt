Mask is a must especially during this period and has become part of our first-aid kit!

We all know the different types of masks available: cloth mask, surgical mask, medical mask, etc.
.
Do you know that Surgical Mask has different grades too? I was lost while trying to find the right surgical masks for my family.
.
I'm so glad to be introduced to the Bio-LabOne Made-In-Singapore masks that are manufactured in Clean Room and all their masks are sterilised before packing!
