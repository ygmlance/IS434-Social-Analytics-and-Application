We can help boost our immune system by implementing best hygiene practices, limiting the number of bacteria and other harmful contaminants that can enter the body. ðŸŒºHand washing with soap and water before preparing food and after using the bathroom. ðŸŒºCover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you sneeze or cough. Or cough into your elbow rather than your hand. ðŸŒºDo not pick at healing wounds or blemishes or squeeze pimples. Doing so allows germs to enter. ðŸŒºPracticing good hygiene can also prevent germs from spreading to others and contribute to a healthy community.
