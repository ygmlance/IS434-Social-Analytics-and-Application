With the evolving COVID-19 situation, most of us have had to cook more at home. For many it may have been a long time since you last stepped in the kitchen üòäDid you find yourself missing any vital piece of cooking equipment?‚Å£
‚Å£
Depending on what you‚Äôre preparing, having the right equipment can make a huge difference! Equipment such as a proper cast iron pan to sear steaks, or perhaps even a slow cooker to really make that cut of meat "fork-tender"?‚Å£
‚Å£
At our SFA-licensed studio, we have a variety of quality kitchen equipment for you and your loved ones to try and experience with AFTER THE LIFT! ‚Å£
‚Å£
We look forward to welcoming all you chefs to cook with peace of mind and create your masterpieces at IncuBaker soon. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Meanwhile, stay safe and healthy üòâ‚Å£
‚Å£
Keep an eye out for our post-Covid19 specials too!‚Å£
