~ Toddler friendly Ikea Meatballs ~ I've been meaning to make this ever since it was published. Kudos to #ikea for supporting the global stay home movement. I omited the salt and pepper to make it toddler friendly and I used the sugar free blueberry pear jam from #haruplate in replacement of the lingonberry sauce. I have 2 happy toddlers for dinner today. Lol. #simletseat #homemadefood #sghomecook #toddlerfood #healthykidsfood #instafood #ikeameatballs #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
