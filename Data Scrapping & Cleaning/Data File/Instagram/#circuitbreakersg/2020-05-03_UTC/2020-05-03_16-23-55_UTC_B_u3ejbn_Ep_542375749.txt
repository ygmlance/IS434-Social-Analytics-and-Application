Grounded! Yet another #lego Circuit Breaker weekend 🇸🇬 @singaporeair announced on 25th April  that it would extend its flight cancellations to the end of June amid travel restrictions globally. At present, SIA has passenger flights to just 15 destinations, compared with more than 130 normally. As a result, aircraft are grounded and are filling up the taxiways of airports around the world. ✈️✈️✈️✈️ SIA's cabin crew are taking up roles in the community as care ambassadors in hospitals and transport ambassadors at public transport hubs, putting their renown service quality and skills to good use during covid-19 circuit breaker. 🙏🏻 One will find it hard to imagine how the travel and hospitality industries will be disrupted and transformed post covid-19. ✈️🛳️🏨🏠 Stay safe and stay healthy 🇸🇬! Brick on!
