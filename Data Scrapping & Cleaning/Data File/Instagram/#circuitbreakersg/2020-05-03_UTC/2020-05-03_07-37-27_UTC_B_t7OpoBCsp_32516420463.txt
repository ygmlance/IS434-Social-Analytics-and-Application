All movement counts 🤸‍♀️💪🏻😁 I did not feel motivated for a workout nor a run this morning. Quite honestly I was tired and a bit grumpy (ask my husband)🙈 But I reminded myself how good it feels afterwards and got a Tabata workout done. Immediately after I felt energised and my mood increased drastically, which definitely made mine and my husbands Sunday a whole lot better 😂

Remember guys, all movements counts! No matter if it’s a quick 15 min workout, a walk or a long sweaty workout in the gym. 1 thing there is guaranteed, is you feel so much better afterwards and your mood certainly increases too 😁 
So let’s all get some movement done this Sunday 💪🏻🤗 @doyouevenwomen #fitness#fitfam#fit#fitnessmotivation#tabata#fitspo#crossfit#health#healthylifstyle#personaltrainer#workout#motivation#instagood#nutrition#workoutmotivation#healthsg#circuitbreakersg#doyoueven#doyouevenwoman#cwmfitness
