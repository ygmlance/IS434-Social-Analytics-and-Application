This is it! Final day to report for my contact tracing duty. I've been on redeployment since 27 January 2020 and it has been an amazing 3 months! Seeing all the team members working hard and meticulously calling and calling and calling everyday to stop potential community spreading of unknown (asymptomatic) individuals. The experienced has been both educating and rewarding. I am thankful for the opportunity and definitely do it again if given an opportunity to raise üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è my hand and volunteer.

As my business-as-usual role is getting a little busy and team needs me back so that's it for now for my contact tracing and back to being an IT Recruiter.

To all my fellow members, frontline health and non-health workers who are working hard during this period relentlessly, I wish you all the best and continue to support our nation working diligently, vigilant and STAY STRONG!

Thank you to my wife and daughter for the amazing support, the late nights, the weekends I'm gone to fight for our nation safetly! Love u both loads!
