“Here missiles fall and people die. An hour later, people go back to their daily lives, and to procuring the essentials, the food and drink they need to survive. But I found it terrifying this relationship with death and how it had become such an integral part of the way of life”..... “we want justice for our people. But we don’t want other countries interfering in our affairs. We’d be better off if they left us to face Bashar alone, without interfering. Their interference only works in his favour”. From “The Crossing, my journey to the shattered heart of Syria” by Samar Yazbek.  Positive side of the circuit breaker: so many great books to read! #syria #circuitbreakersg #expatlivingsg
