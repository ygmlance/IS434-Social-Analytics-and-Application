I love a nutritious Herbal Chicken Soup once in a while 
to help revitalise my energy level for the new week ahead.
I have had quite a penchant for herbal soup in the past few years because the TCM sinseh told me I needed to drink soups that help to “warm up” my body which is on the “cold” & “yin” side. In TCM the herbs used in this soup can help to alleviate the “chills” in the body too, and that’s why whenever the weather is cool I am drawn to it.
