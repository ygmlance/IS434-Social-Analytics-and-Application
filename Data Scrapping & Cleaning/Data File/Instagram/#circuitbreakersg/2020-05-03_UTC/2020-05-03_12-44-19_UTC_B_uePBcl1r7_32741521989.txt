Back then, I went on a vacation not long after I’ve started on my jump rope journey. The place was so beautiful with such nice weather, it’s a crime not to get some jumps in! I was only a newbie but I thought this would be awesome! Hahah, I only wish I was back there again w better skills this round to really get a good workout in! 😝
