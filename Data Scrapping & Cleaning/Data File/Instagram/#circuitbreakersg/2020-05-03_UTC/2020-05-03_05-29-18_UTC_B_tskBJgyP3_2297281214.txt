Yesterday was a big race day for @osteopathichealthcare's own paddling Osteopath, David Farrelly @paddlingosteo.singapore.  While Dave was supposed to be in Hawaii racing the Molokai Solo 2020, as luck would have it, he was given a wildcard entry into the Singapore Solo 2020!  It was tough competition with up & coming star paddlers dominating the field.  This veteran paddler fought hard and managed a placing in his age group.  What a heart-stopping and exciting race it was!  Well done, Dave! 🏆🎉
Dave would like to thank the wonderful organisers and fellow participants of the Singapore Solo for an amazingly well organised and challenging competition!  Our own paddling Osteopath is looking forward to competing again in Hawaii and Singapore in 2021!  Bring on 2021! 🛶🌊

We hope everyone is having some fun family time during Singapore's "circuit breaker" and we hope that the family bonds and relationships are much stronger than they ever were before.  Hang in there everyone!  We got this!  Let's fight COVID-19 together! 😷💪🏻
