BRASS CLEANING TIP: We are mostly indoors now during the lockdown, it’s the best time to give your brass pieces some loving. Treat your jewellery like any other wardrobe item. Clothes must be washed and repaired- the same goes for jewellery. 
Like all jewellery, our pieces require a little bit of care and attention to keep them looking as new and shiny as when you received them, especially in humid countries like Singapore.

One tip is using Lemon juice & baking soda. These two ingredients are powerful natural cleaners on their own, but when mixed together, this dynamic duo removes brass buildup with ease.

HOW TO CLEAN:
•Start by squeezing the juice from half of a lemon into a bowl. Add 1tsp. baking soda and mix.
• With a clean cloth, rub some of the mixture onto the brass. Polish and buff away grime, reapplying the mixture as needed.
• Wipe away any leftover residue with a wet rag, then dry with a clean cloth.
•Use a toothbrush to get into spaces that are hard to get to.

Happy buffing!
