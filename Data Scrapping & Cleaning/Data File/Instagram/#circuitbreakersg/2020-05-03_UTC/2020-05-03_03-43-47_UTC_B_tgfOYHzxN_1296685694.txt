Girl’s 1st attempt to make egg tarts! IMO tastes even better than TC bakery! She did everything from scratch all by herself while mommy helps with the cleaning & washing.😄 .

My family loves eating Hong Kong Style egg tarts and so far we have been buying it from our favourite bakery. Now with this recipe we can bake it at home! 😍 .

Swipe to the 4th pic for the cross section - look how smooth the egg custard is and how thin and even the crust!.

Here’s sharing the egg tart recipe which my girl has adapted from Tasty for the fillings and she can’t remember where for the dough. Please watch the short video at the end for reference..
