Day 26. A lazy day for us. Woke up before sunrise and kept to the morning routine. Breakfast - the usual plus a rye loaf and rolled barley porridge. Lunch - mushroom risotto with black fungus and roasted pork belly. So looking forward to the last day of HBL! #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #spendingtimewithfamily #instadaily
