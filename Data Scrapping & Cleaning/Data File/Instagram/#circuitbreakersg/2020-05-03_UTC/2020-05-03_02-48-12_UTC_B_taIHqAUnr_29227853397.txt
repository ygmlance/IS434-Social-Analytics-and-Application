Love these photos taken at #singaporebotanicgardens by @bloomphotographysg before the #circuitbreakersg 
This is not only a great place for photos, it is a lovely place for people to visit. ðŸ‘‰ World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The 158-year-old gardens are located on the edge of the Orchard Road Shopping District and are home to the world famous Orchid Garden of Singapore.
ðŸ‘‰  the park is established by Sir Stamford Raffles, who founded Singapore and was himself a keen horticulturist.
ðŸ‘‰ Named after a philanthropist who donated to the gardens, Jacob Ballas Children Garden has a Water Play Centre and a childrenâ€™s playground (closed temporary) that includes pretty little tree houses, slides, and mazes. Apart from all this, you can also have your family feed swans and fish at the ponds around the Gardens. Children can learn about photosynthesis, use of flowers and herbs, etc.
ðŸ‘‰ There are many photogenic and Instagram-worthy places like the more than century old pavilion, roots tunnel, super old trees (try spotting the old tee on the $5 note) and Tanglin Gate (does it look like the gate of @basilicasagradafamilia ?) #botanicgardensingapore #singaporeparks #unescoworldheritagesite #unescoheritagesite #unescoworldheritagesites #singaporebotanicgarden #singaporebotanicalgarden  #familytravels #familytravelblog #familytravelblogger #travelwithchildren #magicaltraveljournal #familytraveller #travellingthroughtheworld #travellingtheworld #travellingwithkids #travellingfamily #travellingaroundtheworld #travellingram #travellingphotography #travellingphoto
