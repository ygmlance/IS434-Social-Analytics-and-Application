💉 Went to see doctor for my first vaccination today. This trip was a little different because the humans have to stay outside the clinic and I was brought in to the room in my bag by my doctor. It was my first time in the room without my humans and I was honestly feeling a little nervous. Thankfully I got a kind looking doctor and he handled me gently. The process was quick and I reunited with my humans fast. Overheard that everything is fine with me so all's good. I just wish that I don't have to be in the bag all the time but mama says I should stay inside for my own safety. 🤷🏻‍♀️ .
