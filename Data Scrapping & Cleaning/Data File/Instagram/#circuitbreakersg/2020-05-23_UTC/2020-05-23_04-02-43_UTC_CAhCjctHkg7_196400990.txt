Brunch today, was Kway Teow Goreng Puteh Ikan Bilis, or White Fried Flat Rice Noodles with Dried Anchovies. Dried anchovies were fried in oil, and when they were fragrant and about crisp, minced garlic and sliced chilli was added and fried till fragrant. Kway Teow was thrown in, and was drizzled with fish sauce, and mixed well at high heat. Beaten eggs were added, and when nearly set, mixed well with the noodles. Bean sprouts, sliced round cabbage and chopped Kai Lan, or Chinese Kale were thrown in, and mixed into the noodles, along with a splash of water to moisten things up. Just about near the end of cooking, a generous sprinkling of freshly ground white pepper was added to finish. Tasty and satisfying. ðŸ˜‹ #kwayteowgorengikanbilis #indianmuslimcuisine #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
