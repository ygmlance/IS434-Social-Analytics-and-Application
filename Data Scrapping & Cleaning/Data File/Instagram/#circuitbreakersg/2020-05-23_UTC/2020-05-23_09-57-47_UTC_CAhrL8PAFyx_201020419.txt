The infamous Midnight Curry. It's called so because it used to operate from 2am. Q started to form much earlier and it's still true for now. Amid CB, it's now operating from 5pm, instead of the usual 6pm. I like to mix everything up and savour it. 😁😁 PS: I didnt order so many dishes in a pack. Rather, we ordered different dishes for each pack and then shared them. More economical too! #sinchietokehuan #midnightcurry #hainanesecuisine #hainanesecurryrice #curryrice #circuitbreakersg #upperserangoonroad #kovan #singapore🇸🇬
