Day 47 Circuit Breaker Brekkie. Happy super long weekend for me. Started from Thursday. 🤣

Oats with milk again, but added a teaspoon of  organic brown flaxseeds I bought from #ScoopWholefoods_Sg recently.

And I got 3 bananas 🍌🍌🍌 for 80cents (and 3 medium NZ rose apples 🍎🍎🍎 for $2.80) under the special offer section at #meidiya . Totally nothing wrong with the fruits. Perhaps they have just ripened and it's time to go on sale. But to me they are still not ripe enough as I prefer bananas with brown spots on them. They will taste sweeter!
