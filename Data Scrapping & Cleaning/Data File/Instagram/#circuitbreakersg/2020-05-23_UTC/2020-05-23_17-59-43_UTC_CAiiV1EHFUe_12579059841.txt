Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri! 🥳

This week I got to bless a few of my clients with a surprise delivery to celebrate the joyful occasion with them! It is unfortunate that because of the circuit breaker, our Muslim friends in Singapore are celebrating this annual affair with restrictions in movement and therefore can’t go visiting. I’m glad I found an alternative to bring some warm greetings through food deliveries! These kueh lapis brought a smile to their faces and in turn made me smile too ☺️ May all my Muslim friends out there have a great Hari Raya with your loved ones!!! #gratefulben #selamathariraya #hariraya #circuitbreakersg #raya
