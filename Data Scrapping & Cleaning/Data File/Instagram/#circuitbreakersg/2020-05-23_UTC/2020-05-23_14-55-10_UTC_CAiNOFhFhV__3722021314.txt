Matcha Financiers
.

Had a fun zoom baking session with @mongstirs & friends today. I initially had reservations about joining zoom baking class as i believe one can only get the most out of attending a ftf session. But this zoom class proved me wrong. Class was easy to follow with clear instructions. We were guided step by step and all of us ended up with beautiful financiers in different flavours and shapes ðŸ˜„ Thank you @mongstirs
