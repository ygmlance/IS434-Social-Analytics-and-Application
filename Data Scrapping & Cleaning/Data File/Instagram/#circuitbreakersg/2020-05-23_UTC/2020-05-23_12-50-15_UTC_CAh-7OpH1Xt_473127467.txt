23 MAY 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 47

Day 47 - #circuitbreakersg
🤯
Another round of munching day at work.
#cheekueh and 9 layers kueh for breakfast. KFC for lunch. Cooked whole pot of fried rice for dinner and ended with 
Brown Sugar Boba ice cream bar for dessert. Gosh... I need to stop eating!
🤐
On a side note... it has been an exhausting day at work too.
Time to rest.....
