#circuitbreakersg day 47
It’s Vegetarian day 初一吃素. Had pineapple fried rice again but vegetarian this time! Not sure why but the rice was even tastier! Can taste the citrusy from the pineapple better 🤔🤔
Previous round we added prawns and chinese sausage, still good though. But I will definitely prefer vegetarian version for pineapple fried rice! (We use vegetarian ham for fried rice this time 🙏🏻) •
