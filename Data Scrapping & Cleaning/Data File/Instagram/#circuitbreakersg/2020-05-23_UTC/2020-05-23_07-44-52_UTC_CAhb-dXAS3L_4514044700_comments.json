What a sweet guy who is brightening the lives of millions. It\u2019s all about looking at the small things right now. We went to the Botanical gardens today and I saw a women taking photos of the plants and lizards and I thought that was awesome. Small things can make a big difference. So glad you are writing these posts. Insightful and honest! I am dreaming about Bali! We will get our holidays eventually and when we do they will be fabulous!!!!!!",
