This period of school closure is a great bonding for us, spending 24/7 giving me nonstop headache ðŸ˜‚

School is gonna open in 2 weeks time and soon both of you can't play with each other whole day long again. Then we will always look forward to weekends!

Love seeing meimei hugging jiejie like this, feel so loved! ðŸ¥°
