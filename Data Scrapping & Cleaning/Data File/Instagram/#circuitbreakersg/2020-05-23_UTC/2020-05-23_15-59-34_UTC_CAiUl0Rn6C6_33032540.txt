Once upon a time, my childhood ambition was to become a housewife (it’s a strange ambition, I know), that's why I enjoy cooking and sewing. Thanks to COVID-19, I have the time to handmade all these doll’s outfits for my niece, giving me some joy during this trying time. #circuitbreakersg #cbgottalent #dolloutfit #handmade #babyalivedoll #stayhomechallenge #familytime
