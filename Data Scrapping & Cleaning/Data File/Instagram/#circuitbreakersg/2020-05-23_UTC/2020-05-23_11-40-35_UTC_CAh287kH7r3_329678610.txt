@omnimeat, launched by @greenmonday_singapore, a game changer in the plant-based analogue that is nutritional superior and environmentally friendly
.

Attempted to make the @omnimeat into ‘meatballs’ with goji berries to be added into the spinach soup. A simple heartwarming rendition for a belly filling meal
.

Our verdict: @omnimeat was tasty as it was made from shitake mushrooms, pea, non-GMO soya and rice. On my first bite, I still got the’feel’ that it was meat. The perfect healthier replacement for people like me, who loved meat especially pork so much. Ok I am sold .
