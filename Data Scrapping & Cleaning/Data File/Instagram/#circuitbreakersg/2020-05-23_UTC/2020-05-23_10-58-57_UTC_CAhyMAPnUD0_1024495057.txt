Sayur lodeh

A definite must during hari raya lebaran, tho in the big scheme of things (when plating with ketupat), I must say it is not the main star. To me, the sambal ati is ğŸ˜šğŸ˜šğŸ˜šğŸ˜šğŸ˜‹. But the combination of their taste is like..... ğŸ¤¯ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹ Waiting for breaking fast so I can check for their seasoning

1 labu siam (fair price says this is english squash ğŸ˜š), sliced thinly/julienned 
1 small bowl long beans, sliced
1 small bowl cabbage, shredded
1 small bowl tofu puff, diced

1 tbsp bumbu inti (the white kind)
2 small bay leaves
1 tsp salt
1/2 cube chicken bouillon
A dash of sugar to taste
