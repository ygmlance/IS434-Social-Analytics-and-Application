Received this @sudio pink ETT earphone this week and was overwhelmed by how beautiful it is. As a lady who love pink, it was love at first sight when I saw the earphone. Faster took it out and try out. 
I am surprised on how lightweight it is, I do not feel anything on my ear when I am wearing it. The sound clarity and quality is very good too. When I play “titanium”, I would really hear the base of the song. The best of all, is the noise cancelling. This is super great when I am having virtual meeting from work and having exam, so I can focus and not distracted by Leodys. WFH mummy can consider this.

I always love to watch movie and drama on my bed, with my aircon on and the comfort of my bed. However, as I was co sleeping with Leodys, I will afraid to disturb him. Now glad to have @studio ETT earphone, I can go back to enjoy my “me” time one bed.
