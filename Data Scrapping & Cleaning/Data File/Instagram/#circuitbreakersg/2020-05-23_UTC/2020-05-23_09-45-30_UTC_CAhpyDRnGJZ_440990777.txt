@woodlandssd your salted caramel bun and mushroom bialy is so so good!! Taste, sweetness and texture is superb! I'm so going to get them again! Have a good hari raya break Nur and Chalith, rest well! :) 2nd shot is my favourite sambal belachan mixture again, love to pound this paste and this time its drier so the paste is more smooth, so spicy and so sedap. Thanks to @tantinpin for the yummy and super dense belachan! It makes the superb sambal belachan
