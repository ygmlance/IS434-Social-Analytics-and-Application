Covid19 circuit breaker day 48, 24 May 20:

Now my usual personal space has a name, it’s called “social distancing” 😛

Delivering food to the elderly warms my heart. Thanks for inviting me to join u on this @taohueyshots!

If any of y’all need some extra skinny muscles to help, let me know! I’ll be keen to give back in whatever ways I can!
