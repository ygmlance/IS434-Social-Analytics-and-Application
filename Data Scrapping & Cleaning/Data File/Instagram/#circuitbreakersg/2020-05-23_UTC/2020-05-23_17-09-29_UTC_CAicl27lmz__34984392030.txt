🟥💜Shape Sorting🟡🔷
.
.
Recently, I bought a shape sorter on an online platform, thinking that since there were quite a lot of good reviews, I had snagged myself a good deal. To my horror, when they arrived, the shapes and names were mismatched! So, I set off to create my own shape sorter using a recycled box, marker and some tape. ♻️

I then gathered the different wooden block shapes I had lying around the house. It took me about an hour to complete this, but J loved the end product so it was well worth the effort! 💞
