O Allah.. Ramadhan is leaving me, taking with it Your mercy...⁣
⁣
Here I am with my heart still trembling and most distant...⁣
⁣
To try to embrace and grasp so that Your bounty and mercy in Ramadhan do not leave...⁣
⁣
Here I am still breathless in correcting myself in Your presence...⁣
⁣
Here I am still counting the days until I will be with the blessed Ramadhan...⁣
⁣
The heart of Your servant here is still in turmoil from all manners of sins... ⁣
⁣
Forgive me, O Allah, (for you are) the best giver of forgiveness...⁣
⁣
I will strengthen myself even as I am now growing older, carried away by time and age...⁣
⁣
O Allah, may You bless me from breath to breath that I may reach the next Ramadhan...⁣
