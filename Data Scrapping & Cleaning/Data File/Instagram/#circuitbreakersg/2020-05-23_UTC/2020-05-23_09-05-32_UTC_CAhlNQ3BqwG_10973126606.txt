📍🇸🇬 Singapore

First bite of @burgerplussg burgers and I am absolutely sold!
.
▪️Vege Cheeseburger - my favourite
▪️Fish Burger - awesome deal at $2.99
▪️Yangnyeom Chicken - must try!

Their burger buns really 𝖓𝖎𝖈𝖊 𝖆𝖓𝖉 𝖘𝖔𝖋𝖙 which reminded me of Shake Shack burger buns. Great recommendation by the staff on Vege Cheeseburger that was 𝓼𝓾𝓹𝓮𝓻 𝓰𝓸𝓸𝓭 😍 with the avocado, cheese and portobello mushroom.

Paid $20 in total after discount. Total saving of $15.6!
