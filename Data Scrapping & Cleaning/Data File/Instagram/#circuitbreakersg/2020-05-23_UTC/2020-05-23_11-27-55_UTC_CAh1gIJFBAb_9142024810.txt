Made my first challah!!!! And she is ADORABLE. LOOK AT HER. ü•∫ I'm in love.

Challah is probably my favourite bread of all time and I'm so glad I got over the mental inertia and finally made it. This round challah braiding process was really fun and not as complicated as I'd thought. It baked beautifully too (will share in next post) - the exterior was nice and toasty and the inside was so *ridiculously* fluffy and soft, similar to milk bread but more eggy. Brushed it with honey butter when it came out of the oven and the slight sweetness from it was so lovely. Can't wait for challah french toast tomorrow üçØ‚Å£
