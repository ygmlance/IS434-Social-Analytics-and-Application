Circuit breaker Day 47: Western food 👍👍 Ordered:
- Signature chicken (tasted like Hawaiian pizza)
- Grilled fish yuzu (like a mayo infused with yuzu, quite interesting)
- Black pepper chicken (their black pepper sauce is nice)
- Black pepper pork (a tad tough)
Really like that they have sweet potato fries as a side dish, but don’t get the mac&cheese. Who knew coleslaw could be so good, this one didn’t over do it with the mayo. Overall a good western store at a small coffee shop; like Aston’s but a bit cheaper.
