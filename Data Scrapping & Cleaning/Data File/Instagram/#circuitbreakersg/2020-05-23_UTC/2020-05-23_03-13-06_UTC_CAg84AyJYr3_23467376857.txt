CB will end but life isn’t going back to normal - at least not in the next few months. SG will gradually re-open in three phases. .

To all gym-goers’ despair, gyms are not included in phase I. Disappointed but I think it’s better this way. SGreans have proven that they don’t mind queueing for things they desire. I can imagine the long queue or the big crowd at gyms when they re-open. In the meantime, I just have to continue with my home workouts. .

It’s important to add variety to our exercise routines: 1) to prevent boredom and 2) to avoid/delay reaching a plateau in workout performance. Today, I decided to give the resistance band a go! It’s my mum’s btw. .

I used to think resistance bands are meant for stretching or for senior adults - something simple for them to manage. But NO, my back, arms and legs were burning! .

What I did with the band: 
1. 4 x 10 rows
2. 4 x 10 lateral raises
3. 4 x 10 front raises 
4. 4 x 10 bent-over reverse flyes 
5. 4 x 10 Arnold’s presses .

I underestimated it. .
