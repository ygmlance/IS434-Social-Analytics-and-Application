Lunch. #dimsum 
#homemade #radishcake or #lobakgo #萝卜糕
Still fiddling with the recipes but this one turned out fairly decent. Can be a bit softer. Will try again with more water next time. But thought the flavor was quite good. I’ve decided not to use #wheatstarch  in this. Some recipes recommended it but I find, after a few times using it, that it creates a gummy texture. This is just mostly #riceflour with some #tapiocastarch but can substitute the tapioca with #cornstarch apparently. 
The #sugarcaneprawn was bought from @songfishsg and was not bad.
