Let yourself be led by what you find.

A very impromptu piece created yesterday during our weekly @drawplaycreate creation session. Was busy engaged with something else and probably not in any best shape. I do appreciate the space that was given to create though, with likeminded friends ☺️ Whatever came to mind I just put them on the paper, probably looking at it now again I might not put certain things together but I guess that’s the random fun of it.

What might come next intuitively maybe I wouldn’t really know at the moment. Maybe that’s the point? Let’s see:) Stay safe everyone💪🏻
