Tonight’s dinner was fantastic—with fresh Tortelli from @benfatto_95, I made the sauce with Italian sausage, tomatoes, basil, baby spinach, chicken stock and heavy cream.

I added some mozzarella cheese because I couldn’t get any parmesan reggiano.

Paired this with some amazing red wine and sticky date pudding for dessert after.
