#circuitbreakersg Day 48 #stayhomeforsg #vegan It’s another #burger morning! Just a way of using @quornsg #fishlessfingers Tip: Add a generous amount of vegan mayo. Yes, mayo was used due to not having tartar sauce in the house. Threw in the Almond butter because it is new and I wanted to try it. It is not necessary for a “fish” burger. #sgvegan #simple #cookingshowwithin15sec
