Braised Brinjal in Gu Long Brand canned meat sauce, a simple flavourful dish to pair with hot porridge on a rainy, gloomy day. If you don’t have the meat sauce, you could substitute with soy bean paste sauce (tau chu). ~~~
Directions: cut the brinjal into bite size and briefly grill them on a pan. Removed the brinjal and add some oil into the same pan, sauté the red onions and garlic until soft. Add the meat sauce and continue frying until fragrant. Add in the shabu shabu pork slices and mix well. Finally stir in the brinjal, add half a cut of water and braised until brinjal is soft. Add in some soy sauce to balance the sweetness of the meat sauce and the dish is ready to serve.
