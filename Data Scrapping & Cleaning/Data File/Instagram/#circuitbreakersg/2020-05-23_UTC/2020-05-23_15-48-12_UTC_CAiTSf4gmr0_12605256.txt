First ever social distancing performance class, which is the culmination of a first-ever May holidays violin technique bootcamp. The look on their faces betray a sense of self understanding and self encouragement, which we all should do for ourselves from time to time. Three weeks of hardcore technique practice, so yes time for a break for students preparing to go back to school, and teeny break for teacher 😅🏖 Great job to all participants who bit the bullet and went into obsessed mode with me these three weeks. 💪🏽 Have a good long weekend everyone 🥰
