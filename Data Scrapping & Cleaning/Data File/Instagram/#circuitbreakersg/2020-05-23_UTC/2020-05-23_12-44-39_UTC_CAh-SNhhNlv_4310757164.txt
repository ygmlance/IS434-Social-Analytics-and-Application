#circuitbreakersg : 💃🏻 Productive Day 💃🏻 Rainy gloomy morning started with the craving for some old Avocado toast. And i know the day will be very busy though it’s off day officially had other programs, like to give conference speech. Though the day was very busy still managed to prepare the big variety of veggie nutrition rich lunch plate. Swipe 👉🏻 for the lunch plate pics. Then the day ended with breezing nearby walk 😇.
