Black Pepper Crab plus Carmenere on a Saturday Night. The perfect way to start the long Hari Raya Weekend!
. 
This is an economical yet absolutely tasty and fresh seafood option for the easties. Check out this unassuming old school coffee shop out-the Crab BeeHoon is the signature!
. 
Carmenere is a lesser known, often underappreciated grape varietal from Chile. But I find it to be a suitable match for many Asian dish. With this bottle, you can expect a slightly smokey nose and a smooth tannin with medium body.
On the palette, expect red fruits like cherry, cranberry and elderberry syrup (liquorice notes too).
. 
Great balance, not overpowering the dish. A perfect match with the black pepper crab. And yes, you can pair Red wine with Seafood! .
