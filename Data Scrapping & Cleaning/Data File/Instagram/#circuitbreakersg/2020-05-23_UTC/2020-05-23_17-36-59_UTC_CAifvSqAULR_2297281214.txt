Apples and dragon fruit... I love that we can get a hold of all sorts of lovely fruits in Asia... I first tasted dragon fruit in Malaysia and it was the red kind which is a lot sweeter than the white dragon fruit... Haven't been able to find the red dragon fruit so I settled for the white... üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
