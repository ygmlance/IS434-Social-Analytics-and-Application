Today's paella includes a big, fat squid! Thanks to the fishmonger who offered to clean it for us.🙃
Although there is no thyme but we are not missing it much. The freshness of the seafood coupled with the refreshing lemon made the dish flavorful enough. 🦑🦐🍋 Simply love the smell in the house whenever paella is cooking!
