In search of the light. ðŸ’¡ .

No literally. All out lightbulbs are going out and we need an electrician to replace them due to the design but since no one is allowed in the house Iâ€™m just slowly watching them all burn out. Soon we will all be sitting by candle light in the evenings. How romantic. ðŸ•¯ Or maybe I could hit up youtube and learn some sweet new skills. Add them to the plumbing and mechanic skills I have already acquired in the 118 days of isolating. .
