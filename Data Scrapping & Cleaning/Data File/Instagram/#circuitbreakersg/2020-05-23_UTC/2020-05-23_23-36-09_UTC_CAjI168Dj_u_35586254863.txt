Note* This does not apply to all Americans, this is just what I’ve observed.

Everytime I’ve met an American, they will always bring their race into any argument. For instance, some Caucasian woman parks their car illegally and a security guard asks her to move along. Perfectly reasonable request, except the woman starts screaming and accusing the security guard of being racist towards her. Excuse me, this is not America where minorities are spit on and shot on sight.
Coming from America, where the white man reigns supreme and no one would blink an eye on another racist shooting, of course she would feel weird about being the minority. But don’t be scared that some Chinese would pull out a gun and get itchy fingers. 
Worry not Americans, we’re not bigoted racist psychopaths like your fellow friends in the good old US of A
