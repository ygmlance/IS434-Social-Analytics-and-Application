Chet Baker Quartet - Jazz at Ann Arbor, 1954. Chet was on his first American tour after topping several polls for the year. He played week-long dates in the big cities but made 1-night stops in others. Ann Arbor was one such stop, a venue made famous by Dave Brubeck’s earlier visit (Jazz Goes To College). Chet is on top of his game in this live recording and gives you an idea of just how good he was. Another piece of trivia I just noticed too. This show was recorded on Mother’s Day and ‘MOM’ is on one of the flags on the album.  #chetbaker #jazzatannarbor #russfreeman #carsonsmith #bobneel #pacificjazzrecords
