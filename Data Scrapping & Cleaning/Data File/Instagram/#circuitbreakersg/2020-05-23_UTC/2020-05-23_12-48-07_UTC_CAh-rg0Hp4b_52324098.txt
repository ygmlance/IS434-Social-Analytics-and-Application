This was one of those day that called for a serious treat.
.
Crispy fried Ikan Kunning generously marinated with Turmeric and Pink Himalayan Salt. Then deep fried till a golden crisp. So delicious  we were crunching into the whole fish, bones et all.... yum ðŸ˜‹.
.
Paired it with freshly pounded Chilli Padi and roasted Belacan you could smell a mile......And then we raised it to another level with Nasi Lemak Rice (Pandan-Coconut Rice) to soak up all the Vibrant, Tangy, Spicy Cauliflower, Long Beans & Carrot No-ðŸ¥¥ Curry.
.
Slam-dunk, home run. 
Not a drop of anything was left.
