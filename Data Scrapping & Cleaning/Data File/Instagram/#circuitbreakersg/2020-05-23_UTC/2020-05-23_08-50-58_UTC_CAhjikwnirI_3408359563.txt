Day 47 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (23 May 2020) - #lunch was another fridge-clearing exercise using #leftovers and deteriorating food - #quesadilla with #leftover #chicken from Day 45, the leftover 1/4 part of a cucumber, couple cloves of diced garlic, some cherry tomatoes that were starting to wrinkle up and some #parmesan - made a mess of plating but super #yummy ! Wonderful #netflixandchill food while watching my favourite footballer #ericcantona showing his acting chops in a gripping French tv series. #nofilter #easypeasy #homecooking #lunchforone #stayhomestaysafe
