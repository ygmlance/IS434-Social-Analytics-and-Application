XO Clams with Crispy Egg Noodle. Learnt making egg noodles by hand following Louis Tikaram's interesting technique. I should have been more generous with the XO sauce and throw in the broth from the boiled clams! Made everything from scratch - that is MasterChef values. #circuitbreakersg day31 #quarantinecuisine #MasterChefAu #ibonappetit #mylollybellykitchen #lockdowncooking #isocooking #isolationcooking
