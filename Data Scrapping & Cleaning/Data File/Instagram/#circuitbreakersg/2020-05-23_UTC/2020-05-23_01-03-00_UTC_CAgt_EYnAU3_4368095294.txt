🌥️CB Day47 - Breakfast🌥️
.
Meaty Monster duty day👍
.
Love the favourite breakfast for the weekend❤️and we've a change from our normal sunnyside & chicken wings.
.
Was commenting secretly to Mum that Meaty Monster is not creative, seems like every week the menu is not changing. Taa-Daa! He bought different add-ons this week!
.
Hmmm... ... Did Meaty Monster secretly heard our conversation?🤔🧐
.
Who cares? It's happy food going into our happy belly 😊😍😁
