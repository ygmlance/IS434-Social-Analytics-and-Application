DAY 46, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
(Countdown begins!! 10 .... )
DUMPLING AND VEGETABLE SOUP

Today begins the countdown to the end of the CB üíÉ
Not that I have to go anywhere, or do anything, but just the thought of a little more freedom is so delightful üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I shared the braised pork recipe with you all a couple of days ago. Paired it with store bought leaf buns today. 
Made this quick dumpling soup too. I usually make stock and freeze it every two months or so. Just boiled the stock with dumplings (store bought, frozen) and vegetables. Added some chilli oil & oyster sauce for that extra flavour. Super quick n easy, but full of flavour.
