We live in such trying and uncertain times. Ramadhan and Eid has never looked more different for us all as mothers. To mother our own children and make sense of all that’s happening and to also wish to be in comfort and sanctuary of our own mothers and our first home for the festivities. We all want the same thing - to unwind the hands of time and bring back normalcy into our lives.

While this pandemic has forced us to constantly adjust to this rapidly changing situation, we’re leaning towards gratitude and to focus on the silver linings. We’re grateful for our health and to be safe in our homes with our loved ones. We’re counting our blessings today.

Selamat Hari Raya, Maaf Zahir & Batin everyone. Sending you each a virtual hug. Thank you for supporting small businesses such as ours to stay afloat.
