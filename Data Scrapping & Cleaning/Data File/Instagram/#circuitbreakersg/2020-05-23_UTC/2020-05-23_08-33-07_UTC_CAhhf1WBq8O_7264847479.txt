Yoel's 1st Birthday! 
LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF THE CAKE!
A life savior to a quiet mini celebration due to CB. 
Not only the cake is customised , also got storyline hehe. Thank you so much @jolleejellyart , the cake really is the highlight. I only asked for minion (with strands of hair lol) , and this is what I get - such intricate details and the color is so bright! Love all the small deco - mushrooms, grass, tree, flower..etc. @jollee.chong
