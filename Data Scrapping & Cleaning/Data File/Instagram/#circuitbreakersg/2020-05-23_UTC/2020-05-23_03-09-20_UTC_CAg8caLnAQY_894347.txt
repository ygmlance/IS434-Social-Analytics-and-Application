Day 47 : Throw back 2011. The wedding was in Changi Village Hotel. The bride decided to have a pool side wedding because she wanted her dog to be her ring bearer. She decided to wear her red croc shoes for march-in, because she worried her dog will run away half way. When comes to the end of the reception, the groom was thrown into the pool too🤣, it’s really a fun and cozy wedding ☺️☺️💕 #stayhomestaysafe #circuitbreakersg #fightcovid19together #bestoftheday  #sgmakeup #sgmakeupartist  #sgig #sgigbeauty #instamakeup  #love #instagood #onlinemakeupcourse #beautiful #instadaily  #like4like #thelittlebrushmakeup #jovietanmakeupartist #throwback #tbt #ringbearerdog
