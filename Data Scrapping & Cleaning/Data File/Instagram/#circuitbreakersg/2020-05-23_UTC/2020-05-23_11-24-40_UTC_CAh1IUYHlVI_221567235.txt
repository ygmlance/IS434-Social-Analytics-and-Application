Weekends are for blowout treat (cheat?) meals. Lots of people are experiencing cooking fatigue, but we  still find it pretty exciting when you’re cooking something that you’re really craving. Like this plate of steak, roast potatoes and veg that’s almost perfection. Yay for lazy Saturdays! 💕🍷🥩🥔🥕#homecooked #steaknight #myhubbyisaMasterchef #weekend #sgeats #circuitbreakerSG
