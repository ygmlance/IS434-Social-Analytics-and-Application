A scene at the market early this morning; There are lots of things to do before the end of Ramadan which is today but the list seems to have shorten for many this circuit breaker period in Singapore.

This year's Hari Raya celebration will see a marked difference for Muslims as it will not only be a low-key event but will also be confined to immediate family members.

Nevertheless I wished all Selamat Hari Raya! May you and your loved ones be blessed with happiness, health and peace!
