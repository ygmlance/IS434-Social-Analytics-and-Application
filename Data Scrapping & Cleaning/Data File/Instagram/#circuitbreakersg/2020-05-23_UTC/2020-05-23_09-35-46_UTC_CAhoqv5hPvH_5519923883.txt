When Italy meets India and @restaurantnouri meets @benfatto_95! This was one collab meal we couldnâ€™t say No, partly because Iâ€™ve also got a chance to assemble it with simple cooking instructions provided.
.
The creative combination of deliciously spiced Straciatella and artichoke filled pasta with Indian essence of curry leaf and tomato rasam broth was an explosion of flavour, while the Bucatini with cheese sauce and summer truffles is like a reincarnation of mac and cheese, but tastes much better due to its tubular shape that absorbs the sauce.
.
Looking forward to their next creative collab when culture intersects between brazilian and peranakan with @fat_fuku ðŸ˜‰
