Dedicating my 800th post to my weekly dose of buttery goodness from @petitpain.sg (oops but I think it’s my second time this week alr 🙊). Plated on round coupe plate from the Marble collection of @luzerneglobal on my marble table! 😜
✨
Had my top 2 favourite items - classic croissant, orange and chocolate escargot. Always so good, and I really admire them as I can tell that they put lots of ❤️ in the making of their bakes! 🥐
✨
P.S. I’m not sponsored and I pay for all my purchases! They are really that good! 💯
