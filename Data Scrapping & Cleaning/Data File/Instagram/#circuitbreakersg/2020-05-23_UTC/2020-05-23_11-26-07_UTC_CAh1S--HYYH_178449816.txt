Day 47 of #CircuitBreakerSg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After more than a month, I finally got my bubble tea fix. I hadn’t planned to because I don’t want to pay delivery fees just for a drink. But when I was at Jewel yesterday for supermarket shopping, I saw that @signature_by_koi was in operation! Who can resist right, so I queued of course! Got my drink after 15 minutes of waiting.

The menu is slightly different and they only have 3 toppings. You can read more about it on the blog, link in profile!

Btw my cousin was there today at 7pm and reported that she had to wait 1 hr for her drink.
