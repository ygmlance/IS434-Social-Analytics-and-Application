My kids are active and itâ€™s important to give them an outlet to release all that energy. So when they asked me this morning if they can exercise, I let them! My morning workouts two weeks ago mustâ€™ve rubbed off on them.ðŸ˜† I find that when they have ample time to be physically active, they donâ€™t fight as much. And by the time I want them to take a nap in the afternoon, they are more compliant. Being cooped at home for a month and a half can also be mentally challenging for kids, so letting them run around for a while at home gives them that sense of freedom. Of course, I do make sure that any physical activity they do is safe and monitored.
