Yay! Auntie loves Saturdays‼️Baked these 🏉 Bear lychee cookies last week. I was inspired by a picture I saw on the web and bought one big tub of Almonds just to bake 8 cookies? 🤣 I got lazy subsequently and added only the tails instead.

Anyway, I’ve had such a busy week and it’s time to bake again today! Have a great CB Weekend my friends! Let’s gain weight together 👀 #SharingisCaring .
