Finally managed to make some decent tasting and looking shio pan after two failed attempts. The shio pan from Johan Paris was the breakfast go to for @heinisme and myself ðŸ˜‹
.
I used the tangzhong method for this. The bread could have been lighter and fluffier but not too shabby for a first attempt if I say so myself! .
The filling options for the tangzhong method are endless. I plan to try making luncheon meat buns, sausage buns and ham & cheese buns and pork floss buns next time! I prefer savoury buns in general ðŸ˜›
