Feeling of discontinuity as a person. My various selves— woman, mother, teacher, lover, etc —how do they all come together?  And anxiety at moments of transition from one role to another. Will I make it fifteen minutes from now ?be able to step into, inhabit that person I’m supposed to be? This is felt as an infinitely hazardous leap, no matter how often it’s successfully executed.
- Susan Sontag
