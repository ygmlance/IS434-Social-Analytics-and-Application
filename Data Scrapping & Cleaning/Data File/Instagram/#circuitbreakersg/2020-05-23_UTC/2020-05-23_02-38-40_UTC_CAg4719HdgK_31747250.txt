There was a commotion at the vegetarian stall ( Yi Xin 益心素食) while I was queuing for my Ah Ma Lor Mee at 810 Choa Chu Kang Ave 7 the other day.
.
A customer has ordered several packets of fried bee hoon and had confused the stall auntie with the customization for each pack.
.
The customer raised her voice saying that she was in a hurry but the stall uncle managed to calm her down without escalating the situation.
.
I was mightily impressed by the uncle and auntie so today, I returned to give them a try.
.
After studying the menu, I ordered the vegetarian ban mian and wanton mee.
.
By the time I reached home on foot twenty minutes later, the food was cold and the noodles soggy.
.
While the food tastes pretty average, what impresses me was the auntie’s impeccable service.
.
The ban mian's soup was packed separately from the noodle without me asking and she even took the initiative to check if I wanted to have an egg added.
.
While this may seem like a negligible act to most, it is a great deal for me because a lot of times, my vegetarian plans were thwarted by the unexpected egg in my food hence I am really thankful for her thoughtfulness.
.
When I asked for pickled chili for the wtm, she didn’t just plonk them straight into the bag of noodles but packed them separately into a smaller bag for me.
.
And she did everything with patience and a willingness to serve.
.
She even stepped out of the stall to let me know that next time, I could whatsapp to them my order for pick up later so I do not have to queue.
.
I believe their business were quite badly hit by covid19. Please support our hawkers to keep them going especially one with such good service.
