We would like to say a very BIG THANK YOU TO ALL PARENTS AND STUDENTS of Learning Studio. .
Thank you for being adaptable throughout the transition to online lessons during the #circuitbreakersg period. . 
The tutors of Learning Studio believe that our students have grown to be better learners especially during the fasting month. Our students have built stamina during this time. This effort will not be in vain, In Shaa Allah. . 
Have a good holiday and stay safe during Hari Raya ! See you soon in Zoom! 🥰🤲🏻💚
