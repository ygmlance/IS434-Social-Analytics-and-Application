A huge part of my approach to cooking stems from a great respect I have for the dishes and methods of the cooks that came before me. .
.
With the recent loss we’ve experienced, it’s prompted me to take stock of all that I’ve learnt from them, because these traditional dishes and philosophies will quickly fade away if we’re not careful.

Pictured here is my Nan’s Sambal Prawns. Not the typical deep fiery red colour most are accustomed to. The Sambal prawns we grew up with come from very simple beginnings - a rempah of just blended onions and fresh chillies and plump prawns with just their tails left on. .
.
The rempah is slowly cooked to allow the natural sweetness of the onions to develop. Add salt to taste before dropping in the prawns and stirring to coat them till they’re just cooked. This dish with most family recipes goes well with fluffy white rice.

We’ll be dedicating a couple of posts to all these treasured dishes that can be easily whipped up without breaking the bank. Stay tuned and join us on this virtual journey of family dinners :)
