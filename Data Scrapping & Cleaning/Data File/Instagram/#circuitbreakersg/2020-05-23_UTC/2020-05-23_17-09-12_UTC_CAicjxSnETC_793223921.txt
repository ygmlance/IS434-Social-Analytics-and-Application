#circuitbreaker Day 48 | Has it been 6 weeks already? We're spending more days at home than ever before and comforting treats like this Gula Melaka Pandan cake makes cabin fever much more bearable. (Yes, our signature cake is back too!) Honestly, if you ask us, weâ€™ll take any excuse to indulge in a slice of this delish cake this stay-home weekend, paired with a cuppa of course! Available for takeaway from our outlets and delivery via GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo.
