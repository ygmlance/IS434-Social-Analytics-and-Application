A chocolate brownie a day, keeps the CB blues away. ðŸ˜Ž

Made some brownies using a recipe adapted from @thebigmansworld and I really love them! They taste just as how brownies should - FUDGY. ðŸ”¥Probably the best brownies I have ever made. .

I have seen many people posting about how delicious the tau sar pau (red bean paste buns) from Mdm Ling Bakery are, and been meaning to try them. Guess what? A good friend had some delivered to me today without me even having mentioned these buns to her before.ðŸ˜± What a pleasant surprise and how blessed am I!? #gratitudediary
