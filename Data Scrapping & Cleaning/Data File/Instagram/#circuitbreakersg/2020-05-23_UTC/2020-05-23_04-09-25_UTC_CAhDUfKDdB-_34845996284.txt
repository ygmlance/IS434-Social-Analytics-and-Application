♣︎ Breakfast idea ♣︎ Pork Sandwich

With the previous recipe to make butadon, it is actually quick enough to make a smaller portion for breakfast as well.

It will go well with toast and scrambled egg. Just get your bread toasted, egg scrambled, assembled with some greens like lettuce, then is ready to serve!
