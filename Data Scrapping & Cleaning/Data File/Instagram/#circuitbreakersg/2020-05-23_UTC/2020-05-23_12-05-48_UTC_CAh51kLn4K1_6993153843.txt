Butterfly Suncatcher Wings | ü¶ã today we made butterfly wings and learning about light and colours! .
.
(Swipe right to see the process) 
1. Cut out the shape of the wings. 1 side at a time and joint at the edges
2. I didnt have contact paper  so i used the trusty plastic sheets (that we uaed to wrap books) as a transparent base
3. Cut up the cellophane sheet into a smaller shapes and sort it using the cream cracker plastic tray (reuse!) Against a white styrofoam board. Colours shows off better against a white base. 
4. Glue to coloured shapes to the plastic sheet base.
5. Make 2 holes,  use a ribbon to create loops for their arms to go through.
6. Fly, Butterfly! Fly! .

Materials: ‚≠ê Cardboard from Sarah's diaper carton buys @mamypokojp_official ‚≠ê Cellophane from @artwrap_australia ordered via @spotlightstores (poor experience in my opinion) .
