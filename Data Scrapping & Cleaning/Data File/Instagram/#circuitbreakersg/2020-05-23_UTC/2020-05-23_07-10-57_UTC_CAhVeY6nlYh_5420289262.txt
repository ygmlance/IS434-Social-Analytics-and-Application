“As a chef, I’ve trained to challenge myself all the time and to always do something, even if you think there is nothing to do, in the kitchen there is always something to do, you just need to keep looking .

I like to keep myself busy on things I really love to do, can be with Japanese knives with my friend Julius DS, can be working out for a Spartan race with my wife Aika or Sewing projects with my B535!

Now is the perfect time to get to know yourself a bit more and to search or practice what really makes you happy.

To choose something that excites you and scares you at the same time it’s a difficult choice because you know that you are going to sweat, bleed and dead tired. We are all lazy by default because there is no need to put energy into it, we look for comfort, we are programmed for that, but not me.” - Victor C. Molina (@mikasastukasa.sg)
