Thankful and blessed by Pastor Kong's sermon.

"The 284 of Love" ❤💖💝🙏🙏🙏
Forgive : Gr. aphiemi, meaning to let go (non- emotional, a decision). Daily, make a decision in heart/ mind to let go of all offences! Forgive how many times? 70 x 7 times! All the time! .
.
1. Love is not easily angered.
2. Love keeps no record of wrongs.
3. Love does not delight in evil.
To be Christlike is to be good- natured like Jesus! .
.
After feeding on spiritual love word of God, I am blessed to have comfort dessert, chocolate lava cake with blueberries and a cup of Love tea! .🍮🍵
.
Agape love to all! Blessed weekend! 🙏🙌
