10 Days to "Safe Re-Opening".
. 
Weekend is here! 
It's been 7 weeks since the last physical viewing weekend on 4th/5th April 2020. Phase 1 re-opening starts in 10 days but physical viewing of properties is still not allowed. It'll be at least another 4 weeks to Phase 2. Hopefully we are included in Phase 2.

Nonetheless, I feel most agents are quite equipped to assist buyers/sellers. It's still business as usual (in a new way). Just this morning, I have already handled a few enquiries from prospective buyers. Although market is not as vibrant as before CB but things are picking up - viewings can be done through Zoom or 360 Virtual Tours or just video walkthrough of the property. 
There are data showing more and more transactions being done during this period. Even my colleagues and I have been blessed to successfully remotely secure and issue Option to buyers for our sellers during this period.

If you're looking for a home especially landed houses, do check out my website - www.cychai.com (link in bio) for listings or you can contact me with your requirements so I can assist you to shortlist the right house. ~ Have a Great Weekend! :)
