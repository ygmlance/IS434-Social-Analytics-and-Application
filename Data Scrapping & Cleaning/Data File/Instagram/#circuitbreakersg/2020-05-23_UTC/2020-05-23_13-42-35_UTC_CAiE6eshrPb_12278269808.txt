Selamat Hari Raya Maaf Zahir dan Batin to our lovely customers, family and friends. From the bottom of our heart, we seek forgiveness for any shortcoming on our end and we hope to only be able to serve you better.

May Ramadhan had been fruitful and may Syawal be just as wonderful for you and family. Let's dress up tomorrow, even though it's just amidst our own home! ❤️ #insygoodyou #stayhome #staysafe #sgunited #sglocal #circuitbreakersg #eid2020 #syawal2020 #rayabersatu
