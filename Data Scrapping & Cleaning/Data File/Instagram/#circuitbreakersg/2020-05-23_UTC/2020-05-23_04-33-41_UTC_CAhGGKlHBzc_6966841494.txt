We admit it hasn't been easy during this pandemic for a multitude of reasons, but we do need to remember to give ourselves a pat on the back once in a while for playing our part in #flatteningthecurve
⠀
Closing in on 8 weeks of #CircuitBreakerSG, it is commendable how everyone has dropped their differences and banded together to fight this virus. We celebrate this camaraderie by bringing you a little respite, with not one but TWO WMU sessions by local and regional artistes! Join us, and you may just discover your next favourite Artiste / Band!
⠀
WMU #3: Thursday, 28 May @ 8pm, featuring May (KOR), Woody (KOR) and @ian_ianization (SG)
WMU #4: Sunday, 31 May @ 8pm, featuring @jumpstartsg (SG)
⠀
Mark your calendars! Till then, have a safe and restful Hari Raya Puasa weekend! <3
