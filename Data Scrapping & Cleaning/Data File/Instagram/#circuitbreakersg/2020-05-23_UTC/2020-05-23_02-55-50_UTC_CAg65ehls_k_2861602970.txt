#circuitbreakersg day 46

Braised pork buns æ‰£è‚‰åŒ…ğŸ¤¤
Added yam and mushrooms (you can actually make vegetarian version too, 3rd & 4th pic is Yam n mushrooms)

Bun is from @noodleman678 Itâ€™s so soft and i like to eat it plain tooğŸ¤£

Do you prefer fatty meat or lean meat? Fats is for sure for me but needa stay healthy ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜­ Also had Long bean omelette and Stir-fry Sweet potato leaves.
