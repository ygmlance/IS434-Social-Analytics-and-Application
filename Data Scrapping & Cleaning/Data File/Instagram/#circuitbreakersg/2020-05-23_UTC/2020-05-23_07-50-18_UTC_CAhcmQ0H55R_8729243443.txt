Jack and I agreed that J1 needs some outdoor time so he took her to cycle this morning for the first time after 2 months!

J1’s eyes lit up when she saw her long pants in Jack’s hands and asked “Are we going out?” And she was super cooperative and did everything that she was told to do quickly. While She was putting on her own clothes, she started thinking aloud what shoes to wear.

The first thing she said when she saw her bicycle was, “Why is my bell upside down?” Then she realised it’s not but rather the top was missing. I told her somebody played with it and spoiled the bell. She said, “So I cannot ring my bell anymore?” I said, “Yes for now and we will buy her a new bell.” I gave her a hug and she said okay. My little sensible girl.

Do remember to get ready masks for your kids. Check out my previous @shieldmasksg giveaway if you haven’t do so!
