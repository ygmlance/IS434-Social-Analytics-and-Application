Seafood Ee Fu Mian
.
During my childhood, Ee fu mian is one of the dishes I always look forward to when attending wedding dinner. It is that few dishes which I will eat during wedding banquet when young and always complain to my parents why it is always serve as the second last dish.

Previously I bought and cooked #Eemian but the taste was different. Chanced upon the Ee fu noodle when ordering grocery through #Redmart and tadah the taste finally matched my memories.
.
Now no need to wait for wedding banquet to enjoy this simple dish.
