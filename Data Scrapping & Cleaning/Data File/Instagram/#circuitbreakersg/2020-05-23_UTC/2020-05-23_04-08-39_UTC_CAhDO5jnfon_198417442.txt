💖Lobster Shack💖

#circuitbreakersg ain’t that bad... Because I finally got the chance to try @lobstershacksg lobster rolls✌🏻 Have been seeing them on Instagram posting their pop up stores but I don’t go to those food markets so I haven’t had the chance to try them. Today is the DAY!😍 ✅Truffle cheese - Strong aroma of the truffle oil!
✅Spicy Mentaiko - Savoury and creamy! Didn’t find it spicy though. But still my favourite sauce!😋
✅Chilli crab - Tangy tomato sauce with a spicy kick from the chilli padi.🌶 ✅Classic - Mayo sauce ✅Truffle cheese fries - Strong aroma of the truffle as well!
✅Mentaiko fries - Would be good if it came with extra mentaiko sauce!

Overall, lobster meat was so fresh and juicy qq. Broiche roll was nicely buttered and toasted. Not too greasy. And the fries as well wasn’t too oily. Perfection!💯🙌🏻 One of the best lobster rolls I have eaten! On par to my favourite Luke’s lobster roll in Japan la.💓
