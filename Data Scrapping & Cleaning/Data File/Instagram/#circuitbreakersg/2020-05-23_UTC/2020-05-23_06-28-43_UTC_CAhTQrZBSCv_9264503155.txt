Beloved Sisters~

Here are some tips to keep us hopeful.
Since the first nine days of Syawwal,
We can't go out for visiting.

Why not we seize the rewards to fast for the whole year?
Yes, you are right.
It's the Fasting 6 days of Syawwal.

There are two reasons these six days have been made available to us.
1. We will follow the deeds of Ramadān with more good deeds;
2. To give us the reward of fasting the entire year.

Let's seize the mercy from Allah for us.
The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:
“Whoever fasts Ramadān and follows it
with six days from Syawwāl it is as if they fasted
the entire year.”
~Muslim

When to start?
Why not start on Monday (25/5/2020)
Because Monday is the sunnah day to fast after Ramadan.

Shall I do it consecutively?
Yes, if you can.
It is okay to do it Like Prophet Daud 'alaihis salaam.

Let's keep the good spirit and be positive
to go through the last 10 days of Circuit Breaker.
