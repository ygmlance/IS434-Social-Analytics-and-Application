Day 45. As we experience the early monsoonal clouds and rain recently, the temperature seems to be more bearable. Lunch - Mr.cooked Japanese Butadon pork bowl that comes with radish and shirataki. Missy asked me if we baked scones with fillings in muffin tin, do we call them - scoffin or muscones... So, we cooked some apple jam and baked some scoffins (we decided on this). The buttery fragrance and the cinammonly sweet taste of apple jam is one awesome combi. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #scones #applejam #instadaily
