Child-led puzzle fixing🧩
👑
So mm has attempted this small-sized 60pc puzzles for 3 times or so, and the most I’ve seen her do was a third of the puzzle before scooting off💨 Even if I invite her back to complete the puzzle, she won’t be interested much (ps. she picks whatever puzzles she wanna do off the shelf).

Today she decided that while “playing” snake and ladder with us, she wanna do this puzzle🤷🏻‍♀️ And nvr did I expect that she managed to conquer it today! I love looking at her tiny chub hands work😍😍😍 and observing her thoughts🧠 which are translated into her actions🙌🏻 For the last 2 minutes or so, I asked the other duo to hold on the game, as I saw her really focused on completing the last few pieces💫 And there, at her own pace, she did it🌟

I always believe in having a prepared environment that can set the child up for success-being age appropriate/child interest focused is a good place to start from. The resources shouldn’t be overly complicated for the child yet shouldn’t be too easy as well; there shld be a slight challenge that’s conquerable with the child’s existing skill sets (or skills that he/she’s sharpening).
