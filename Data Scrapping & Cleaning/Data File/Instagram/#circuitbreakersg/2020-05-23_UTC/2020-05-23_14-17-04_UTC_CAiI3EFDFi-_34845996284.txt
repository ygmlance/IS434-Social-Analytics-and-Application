Tom yum fish

Tom yum is a good idea if you want to clear fridge. I have some left over here and there so decided to put all in one pot and top it up with batang sliced fillet from @9sseafood

I also boiled chicken soup myself over the weekend so use that as the soup base. You can use water or ready to use chicken stoke as well.

Ingredients: batang sliced fillet, cabbage, king oyster mushroom, potato x 2 very thinly sliced, 1 stalk of lemon grass, toufu, Tom yum paste

❶ Marinate batang sliced fillet by applying a thin layer of salt. Keep it for 30 minutes
❷ Slice shallots and fry till slightly brownish
❸ Add lemon grass stalk and continue to fry
❹ Add mushroom, cabbage and potato. Add 600ml of chicken soup. Bring it to boil and continue boiling for 10 minutes
❺ Add Tom yum paste, mix well and continue boiling for 10 minutes. Add toufu after the pot is mixed well so that you don’t stir a lot and toufu will break during stirring
❻ Add batang sliced fish and continue to boil for 10 minutes. Then ready to serve with chinese celery ⚠️If you are getting bored with rice, try pairing Tom yum with udon. I think they are perfect match
