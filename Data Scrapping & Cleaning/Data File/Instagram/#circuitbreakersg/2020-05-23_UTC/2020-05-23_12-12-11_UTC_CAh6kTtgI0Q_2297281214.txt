I was ecstatic when a good friend called to say, "Will be doing roast beef... Pass you some when done..." That meant two things... 1. Whoohoo!  I don't need to cook tonight and 2. I'm getting a fantastic roast beef for dinner!
This friend is an amazing cook and his melt-in-the-mouth rosemary buttery roast beef is always just the perfect pinkness that I love and absolutely to-die-for!  It even came with an amazing red wine garlic gravy... I served up the roast with cauliflower rice, broccoli and ate mine with Dijon mustard... Scored well for day 47, thanks to awesome people! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
