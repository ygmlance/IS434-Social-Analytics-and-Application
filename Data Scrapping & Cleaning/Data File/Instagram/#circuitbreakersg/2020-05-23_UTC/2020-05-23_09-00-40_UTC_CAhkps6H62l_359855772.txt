#Throwback on our making of Tuna Prata Puff~

Recently my friends are all 'crazy' about making pastry using frozen prata, and there is this Tuna Puff recipe shared online, so we give it a try!

She is inspired by xmmjosie, and been asking me to take videos of her 'work in progress' videos like jie jie, so here is a simple one (sorry mama's video editing skill not good). Unfortunately, my grand plan of making her learn more vocabulary through cooking is not working, so she can only anyhow share on what's on her mind. [Recipe]
Tuna Prata Puff 金枪鱼泡芙

INGREDIENTS: • 6 Frozen prata
• 3 slice of cheese
• 1 can tuna
• 1½ tbsp japanese mayonnaise
• 1 beaten egg (For egg wash)

DIRECTIONS: • Take out the prata from the freezer, let it thaw for about 2-3 minutes to soften (note not to take out all at once as they will soften very fast)
• Combine the tuna mayonnaise with japanese mayonnaise and mix well
• Cut cheese into half
• Arrange frozen prata on a baking tray, put half slice of cheese in the middle of prata, and some tuna on the centre of the prata
• Fold prata into fold and seal the edges with a fork by pressing them together.
• Poke holes on the puff with a fork, and egg wash prata
• Bake in preheated microwave oven at 180C for around 30 minutes or until puffed up and golden brown
