Are you spending more time with your loved ones during this Circuit Breaker? • @mystorytreasury MAKING DUMPLINGS 一起包饺子

We read about making dumplings together in 《过年啦!》Chinese New Year Pop-up Book, introduced in the previous post!

Since I will be in post-baby confinement during CNY, I decided to make some dumplings ahead of time, and freeze a big batch so we can have them ready to enjoy when the craving strikes!

We had two different fillings
🥟 minced pork, cabbage, chives
🥟 minced chicken, cabbage, spring onion
wrapped inside store-bought chilled dumpling skin 水饺皮 by @wulihaonoodles

My late grandma taught me years ago, for Asian dishes, the basic marinade for meat consists of:
Light soy sauce 酱青
Sesame oil 麻油
White pepper powder 白胡椒粉

After the fillings were prepared, I sat down at my mum-in-law's dining table to wrap these goodies. The curious kids came uninvited and asked to make some too! My hands were all sticky with raw meat, so didn't manage to take more photos of the process with kids.

My dumplings aren't very pretty, but as long as the filling is enclosed within the skin, it'll work and taste the same! 😅 For one dumpling, I accidentally used 2 dumpling skins and it turned out funny-looking. We had a good laugh about it, and I tried to remind my sometimes-perfectionist son that making mistakes is perfectly okay.

I tried to be chill and just let the kids have fun, following the basic steps and maintaining basic food hygiene. Meat fillings spilling out? No worries, we'll just steam them instead of boiling them in water, so they stay relatively intact. The ingredients are still the same, and will taste the same, isn't it? I hope they remember us giggling over spilled meat and being proud of their own creations, as well as enjoying the yummy fruit of their labour!

To freeze, we laid the wrapped dumplings on a baking tray lined with baking paper, spaced apart. After a few hours, we popped them into ziploc bags to save space in the freezer.

To enjoy, just put the frozen dumplings in boiling pot of water till they float, or steam till the dumplings puff up! Safest way is just to try one. Pan-frying them afterwards makes it extra yummy!
