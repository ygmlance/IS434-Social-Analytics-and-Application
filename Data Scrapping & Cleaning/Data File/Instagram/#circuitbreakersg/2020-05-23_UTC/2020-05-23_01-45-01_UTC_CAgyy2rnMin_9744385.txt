For the last 45 CB days, it has become a new norm for a morning walk with Sage and she gets excited feeding the 7 neighbourhood cats and waving at her rubbish truck uncles. She absolutely adores the uncles who never fail to stop the truck and wave back. Canâ€™t wait to offer them a packet drink once this is over. #CircuitBreakerSG #DearCovid19SG
