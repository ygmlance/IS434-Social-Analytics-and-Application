Little E was challenged today with sorting the transportation vehicles into 3 main groups and taking about the characteristics of each vehicle. We then sort them into groups with wheels /without wheels, carrying many people /carrying less people.

We further extended our learning by sorting the flashcards with those that she can name and not. We will be working on those that she can't yet! (Mama is working on finding out the Chinese names of some!) #howssg #howsbox #howsboxtransportation #openendedlearning
