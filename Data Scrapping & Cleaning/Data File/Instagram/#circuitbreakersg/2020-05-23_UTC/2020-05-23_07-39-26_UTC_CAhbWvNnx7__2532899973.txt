Canâ€™t believe itâ€™s the eve of Eid and canâ€™t believe I canâ€™t get to eat mumâ€™a cooking this year. The last this happened was like 4 years back when she stayed with dad in HK while he was working there. Eid is the only time I cook â€˜fancyâ€™ food. Okok last year I only cooked Sayur Lodeh and ordered the rest as I was lazy but this year, Iâ€™ll be cooking every single dish on my own. I donâ€™t know who else is gonna eat them but Iâ€™ll freeze half of it. It takes lots of time to cook each one of them as thereâ€™s no short cut for good stuff I guess? Itâ€™s really heartening seeing all my other friends doing the same! Iâ€™ve not started. I chose to not stress about it and start tomorrow morning after all, I ainâ€™t got nowhere to go ðŸ˜‚

The daun kunyit aka turmeric leave adventure earlier was great coz I kinda entered the wrong entrance at St George Sheng Shiong. Ur, I really was not aware but I didnâ€™t went inside coz the queue to enter the supermarket was RIDICULOUS so we drove to the other side of the neighbourhood and I got to meet my 2 favourite black cats. You can see their vid in my Insta Story. They are getting chonkier now and I went â€˜awww I cannot!!â€™ verbally and quite loudly in the queue coz you know what? I donâ€™t care what others think of me. But then hor if people think I donâ€™t do work when in fact I have been busting it out, then thatâ€™s a totally different ball game. Howâ€™s the prep for Eid Geng??
