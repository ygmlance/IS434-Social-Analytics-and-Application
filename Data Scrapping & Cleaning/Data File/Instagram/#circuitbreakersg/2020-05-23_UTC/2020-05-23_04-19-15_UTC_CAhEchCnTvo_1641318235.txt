I really love this artwork by Bel yesterday, competed within 90 mins at Online Lesson 3 with @MuzArtSingapore. They were to "DIY Activity Game Cards", so this was later cut up into a puzzle game. #swipe⁣
Bray on the other hand made an ice-cream cone themed colour matching game. ⁣

This week, the kiddos revisited the impact of covid-19, how our lives were affected, and how to cope by stepping up on our hygiene and being socially responsible. The revision of the topic helps, as they're going back to school again soon, with new practices and masks on the whole day. But most importantly, they learnt to share their care and love for the seniors and elderly, who may face social isolation especially during this circuit breaker period.⁣
⁣
So these games they made aren't for themselves! @MuzArtSingapore will be collating all these games made by the children and distributing them to seniors and elderly to brighten up their day!⁣

These are really easy to make with just cardboard, scissors and colouring medium. If you would like to join in this cause, just DM them ahead and send your completed DIY games/activities (any kind!) to @MuzArtSingapore at:⁣
