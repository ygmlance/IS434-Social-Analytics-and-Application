Sweet potato leaves 💕 Growing up, my grandma & mom used to cook this at home so often and it goes so so well with plain rice or porridge! 🍚😌
.
Simply stir-fry tons of chopped garlic 🧄 for a few minutes, add in the veggies, add light soy sauce, salt, pepper and some water. Mix well and allow it to simmer till they softened. Throw in chopped chilli padi 🌶, stir it up and they’re ready to serve!
.
Tip: While prepping, pull and discard the outer layer of the stems. It may take some time but the improved texture is worth the extra effort!
