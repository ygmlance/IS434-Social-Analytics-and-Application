#CircuitBreakerSg Day 47! Took a rest this evening and ordered Dim Sum for dinner from #TimHoWan through #deliveroosg! ðŸ˜‹Tried something new today. The seasame ball with salted egg yolk sauce and HK milk tea are all quite nice! Btw THW has some pretty good deal going on like the baked bun and congee are Buy 1 get 2nd at $2 only. #justsharing #notsponsored
