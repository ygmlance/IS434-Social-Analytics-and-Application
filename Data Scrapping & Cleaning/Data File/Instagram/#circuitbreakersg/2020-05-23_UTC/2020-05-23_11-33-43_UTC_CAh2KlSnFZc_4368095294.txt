🍄CB Day47 - Dinner Time🌽
.
Went to dabao Chinese BBQ for dinner. Seriously craving for either 乳鸽 or 鹌鹑... Till now can't forget the wonderful taste in HK & Malacca. But we can't travel 😱😱😱 so how? .
Rampage my memory... ... Near me there's this Chinese eatery that sells 串烧 and they sell 烤鹌鹑🐦🐦🐦 so don't think Liao, just go get it!!!
.
Glad it's open and finally satisfy my cravings!
.
So I mix and match to form a Chinese BBQ Plate
🤤🤤🤤
