Day 47 of CB - Lunch was Vietnamese Summer Rolls. One of my favourite no fuss meal to prep. This is summer roll with a twist since we like to do it with turnip, similar to whatâ€™s found in popiah. Except that this tastes much lighter and bursting with the flavors of basil and mint. #homecooked #umamilicious #circuitbreakersg
