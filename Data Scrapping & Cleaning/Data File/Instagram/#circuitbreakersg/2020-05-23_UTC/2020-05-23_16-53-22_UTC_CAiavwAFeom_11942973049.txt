This year’s birthday is definitely the most unique because of the Circuit Breaker measures in place due to Covid-19. It was just another normal CB day for me. Have my birthday off from work, get the car washed, head out to get dinner for family to have a mini celebration and supposedly ending with a movie night with friends. But plans changed the entire day. Doorbell rang, delivery guy and food receipt gave away a surprise, and what supposed to be a movie night became a birthday surprise celebration with family friends. Thank God for friendships that stretched way back to when we were born, to newly forged friendships. Fun fact, each of them had a stint sending/fetching me to and fro the hospitals for my injury (almost made a full tour around all the hospitals in Singapore). Words can’t explain how much these friendships means to me. Thank you for the friendships and taking your saturday night time to celebrate this uniquely Stay Home birthday party with me. I love y’all! ❤️ thank you everyone for your well wishes. ❤️ “A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out.”
