A guide to making a Spicy Chicken Sandwich. This is one that is influenced by many, and there are lots of steps involved. Follow them to a tee for the best results. Brine your chicken. 5% for an overnight brine per @ruhlman. Spicy Seasoning inspired by my friend @morgygalinha of @belleshotchicken. Burger Sauce from Shack Shack. Fries are Russets that are twice fried. @Jolenekcw baked the amazing buns. We are the sum total of our experiences.
