CB day 47: Giving the bike the boost it needs. Ordered and installed the #boosterplug for the F800GT. Package came super fast from Copenhagen, just 3 days upon ordering. Installation was rather easy, just need to tap to the existing air intake sensor connection, and route the sensor to the air intake scoop. No more jerky idling (which was my complaint to an otherwise perfect bike) and low rpm throttle response is much smoother. Definitely not a placebo. #bmw #bmwmotorrad #bmwfseries #F800 #F800GT #makelifearide #sgbikers #sgriders #sgbikes #ridersofinstagram #bikersofinstagram #bikersofsingapore #motorcycle #tuning #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #socialdistancing #sgunited #redhareridersg
