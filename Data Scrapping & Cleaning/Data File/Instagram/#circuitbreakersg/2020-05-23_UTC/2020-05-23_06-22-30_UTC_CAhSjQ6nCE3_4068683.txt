Many times I hear people saying "I must have a cup of coffee to start my day" or "I need a few cups of coffee to last through my day". Well this was me previously. I need my coffee to perk me up in the morn & probably another cup of coffee/tea/milo in the afternoon to get me going for the rest of the day if not I'll be sluggish like mad.⁣ 😕
⁣
But now, I just need a dose of my ketones instead to start my day and I can last through the entire day & it comes with superb benefits like optimized cognitive function, fast & sustained energy, supports healthy cell function, better sleep, better mood, better focus, better fat loss, elevating essential amino acids, DNA REPAIR and so much more that I can go on. 😄😄⁣
