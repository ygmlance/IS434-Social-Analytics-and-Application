The long weekend is here! We know you can no longer differentiate weekdays from weekend. But hey, you deserve a break nonetheless. While you can’t head out to party, you can treat yourself to a margarita (frozen, or on the rocks). ⁠
⁠
Interested? We’ve got not one, but FOUR fruity summer-forward flavours for you to choose from, namely lime, lychee, mango and strawberry. Each promises to deliver equal amounts satisfaction and buzz 😉⁠
⁠
Our margaritas are available for both deliveries & takeaways.
