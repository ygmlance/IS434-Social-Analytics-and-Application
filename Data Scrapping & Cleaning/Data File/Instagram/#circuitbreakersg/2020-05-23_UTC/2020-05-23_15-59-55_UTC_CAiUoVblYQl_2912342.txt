Genuinely happy when I sneaked out of the house while mum was at work to go NTUC and get some stuff to satisfy my cravings! Even put on denim shorts (not shown in photo) and my bracelets which I havent worn since 19 Mar. Yes, that's how long I've been working from home. And yes, I've finally went out after 65days! Wahahaha. THIS IS THE NEW BLISS.
