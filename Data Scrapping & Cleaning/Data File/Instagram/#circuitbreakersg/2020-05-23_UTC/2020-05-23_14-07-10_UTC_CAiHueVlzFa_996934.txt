#circuitbreakerday47 // A proper fill-me-up before the day’s chores. Who would have thought #kimchigrilledcheese would be so very good? The fermented spiciness of the #kimchi, tempered with the salty tang of matured cheddar (and last last bits of @thecheeseark’s gruyere), between @thebakehaus.sg’s orange-peel-studded #purplewheat #sourdough.
.
It was a #dayofsmallthings (other than that stopover in Exodus as part of Bible Overview) and bursting blisters:
🍃 cut down even more diseased branches from the mango and longan trees - the horror of a head full of spiderwebs and assorted bugs!
.
🍃 2. & 3. checked on the progress of ze mint. What started off as a little sprig from a cocktail B.C. (Before COVID-19), subsequently sprouted in a used @heyteasg bubble-tea cup (also B.C.), and is now growing like the weed the internet says it is;
.
4. checked on Hume II and its #basilplant progeny. The top leaves of several are curling from stress - need to figure out their stressors;
.
5. re-potted the #kale;
.
6. had spatial intelligence challenged, fixing up the #vegepodsg trolley.
.
.
Loads of op-eds going round during #circuitbreakersg about how #urbangardening is good for #mentalhealth, how learning new things during #lockdown2020 provides some solace to the horrible reality that no world power can ultimately contain this outbreak.

But in #Ecclesiastes7 yesterday, we saw that human wisdom is inevitably limited (side glance at: pantheon of Greek philosophers wagging tongues about εὐδαιμονία): .
• it’s useful only if one is still alive;
• but even if one is still alive, it can’t change the circumstances of one’s life;
• and in fact, it can’t even change our own predisposition to sin; and
• the wisest man ever, who had every resource at his disposal sadly concluded that he could only be certain of 2 things: (1) foolish sinfulness must be avoided at all cost; but
(2) we are all uncontrollably sinful.
.
Well, that’s just lovely, Wisest Human...
