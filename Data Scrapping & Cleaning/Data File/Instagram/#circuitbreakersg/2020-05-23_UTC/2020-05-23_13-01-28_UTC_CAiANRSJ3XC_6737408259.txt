💻Had one of those moments that the internet made you buy something? Well, I certainly did! 🙊

After appearing on my social media for a period of time, I finally succumbed to the temptation and bought @aprilskin_sg  Real Calendula Peel Off Pack. So looking back, did I regret on my decision? Read on to find out! ✨

📝 My Review:
*
👍🏻 Upon application, my first impression of the peel off mask is that it’s really soothing, and doesn’t leave a tacky feeling after removing the mask. Containing real Calendula Flower, the mask is gentle enough not to cause any irritation for my sensitized skin and it also helps to calm acne-induced inflammation on my skin after usage. Application is also really fuss-free using the Royal Jelly Brush, as I managed to apply it onto my face without having my fingers to come into contact with the mask at all. 💁🏻‍♀️

Although I can’t really see what have been extracted, I do feel that my skin became softer, smoother, brighter and was glowing upon removal of the mask after just 30 minutes! 🤩 Clogged pores along my temples have also disappeared so the exfoliation really worked! Furthermore, it also leaves my skin feeling clean and oil-production level balanced till the next day!

🤔 The only con I feel would be that it’d be more value-for-money if it comes in a bigger packaging as I have about 3/4 left in the tube despite using it for only twice. And maybe that the peel doesn’t come off in one piece as advertised but that’s not a major issue! 😉
*
✒️ Conclusion: A fuss-free and effective mask that works hard at exfoliating and hydrating the skin, while being gentle on the skin.

💋 Verdict: 4/5 🌟

Thanks for reading! 😘
