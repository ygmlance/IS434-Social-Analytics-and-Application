Day 47 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (23 May 2020) - #nofilter #netflixandchill (of all things, I was watching ep 1 of History 101, featuring Fast Food! ðŸ˜†) #quickdinner  using #frozenfood from Day 5; mixed in some #mascarpone to make the #stew into a dip of sorts for some #tortillachips - missing a bit of heat, probably because of the mascarpone but still quite #yummy for #leftovers #homecooking #stayhomestaysafe #dinnerforone
