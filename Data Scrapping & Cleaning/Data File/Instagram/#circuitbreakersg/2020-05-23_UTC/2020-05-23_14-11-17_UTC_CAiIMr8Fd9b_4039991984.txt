#Circuitbreakersg Day-47, Assam fish, the fresh spice paste took the longest, mom was standing behind me to make sure that I give it enough time to brown and release their fragrant 😁😅 before adding the Assam liquid, it does make a lot of difference. Yummy 😋 and we love it with lots of pineapple. Sweet sour spicy 👍🏻
