Kitchen Cheats| XO Sambal Sauce

Brand: Hai’s XO Sambal Sauce
Price: SGD 3.50

Ingredient A: Kuey Teow Sauce Ratio
4: Light soy sauce 
2: Dark soy sauce
1: Oyster sauce 
1: Fish sauce 
1: Mirin (instead of sugar, we used Mirin so our Kuey Teow is not overly sweet)
Pinch of salt & pepper to taste

Ingredient B:
Kuey Teow Noodles
Tiger Prawns
Lap Cheong 
Fish Cake 
Egg
Pork Lard & Pork Oil 
Beansprout 
Chives 
Garlic

Preparation:
1. Prepare (A)Kuey Teow Sauce with the ratio above and set aside. 
2. Render crispy pork lard (猪油渣）& pork oil (猪油) using low heat. Set crispy pork lard & pork oil aside. 
3. Slice lapcheong & fish cake. 
4. Wash beansprout & chives. 
5. Run Kuey Teow under hot water twice to drain the excess oil.

Cooking: 
Cook in small batches, less is more and easier to control the flavours. 
Patience is a virtue, need to char and caramelise the ingredients
.
.
1. Heat up 3tbsp of pork oil on high heat. 
2. Sauté garlic. 
3. Add prawn, char both sides.
4. Stir fry lapcheong + fish cake. 
5. Add 1 tbsp of XO Sambal sauce. 
6. Char the Kuey Teow noodles. 
7. Start with 3 tbsp of premix sauce (add more if you prefer saucier kuey teow). Coat well, we slowly added more sauce as we char our Kuey Teow. We added up to 5-8 tbsp. Depending on the amount of noodles you have. 
8. Make space in the middle of the pan, add 1 tbsp of pork oil, drop an egg. 
9. Let the egg sit awhile to brown slightly before mixing.
10. Add beansprout & chives. Mix well and serve.

Verdict: Instead of making our own Chili boh, we cheated with XO Sambal sauce. The XO sambal adds fragrance to the Char Kuey Teow and it makes a prefect dipping sauce too! Scoring a 3.5 out of 5!
.
.
Taste: Strong shrimp & scallop taste. Not too spicy, definitely goes well with noodles & rice!
