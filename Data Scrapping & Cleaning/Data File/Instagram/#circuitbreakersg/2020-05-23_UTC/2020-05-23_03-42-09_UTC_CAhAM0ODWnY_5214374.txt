Circuit Breaker Day 46
I continued with punch needle embroidery.
Again, not up to my expectations. 
I saw a particular instagram post which states "Why your art sucks?" And it said that it is because I am at the "gap"... where you are still practising to be better. Stop comparing with those artists (pro and established) but compare with yourself from yesterday.
I had a rather soul searching time when I could not sleep the last few nights. I told myself that because I move from craft to craft, I will always be in this gap. Lol
However, I am not one who can just do one craft... I will eventually get bored with it.
Oh well, I think I should just enjoy what I do.
