One thing we remember from cb will be quick trips out to pick up groceries and food.  With light traffic, we can almost always get home within the hour
.
Better as tag team in such times when there are expected queues, limited entries to malls and carting groceries singlehandedly is not quite easy
.
Crab is a great help except for his social distancing nazi habit of keeping a metre part in public places and often I have to call, with my arms full of produce, to meet up in the supermarket lane heâ€™s in! .
