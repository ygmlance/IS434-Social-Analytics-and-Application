16 May, Dinner, SG - Orange chicken! With mixed vegetables stirfry topped with crispy bits we made from the skin of the chicken thigh we cooked. We were wondering how orange chicken would taste like since it isn't a dish in Singapore and we can clearly understand the hype now 👍🏻 Easy to make and delicious, definitely a keeper on our menu.
