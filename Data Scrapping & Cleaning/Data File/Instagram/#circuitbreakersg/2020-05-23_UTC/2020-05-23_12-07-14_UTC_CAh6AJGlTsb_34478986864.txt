Tonight was #koreanfood from @hyangyeon_kfood. The spicy pork (Jaeyuk Bokkeum) and spicy beef stew (Yukgaejung) came as a set along with rice and Kimchi/side dishes. The portions were huge for $25, and definitely enough for 2 pax. We also ordered seafood scallion pancakes on the side. Overall we were very satisfied!
