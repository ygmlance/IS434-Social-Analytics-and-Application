Selamat Hari Raya to all our Muslim friends! Here are some ideas to spruce up your festive spirit in the midst of this pandemic and make this Raya extra special:

1. Even though visitations are not allowed, you can still decorate your home with festive colours!
〰️
2. Wear the same colours with your family to highlight together-ness as we celebrate remotely.
〰️
3. Try your hand at cooking some traditional favourites like Ayam Masak Merah, Sayur Lodeh, and Rendang (not crispy!), with some help from Mum of course! ;)
〰️
4.Order a surprise gift, a sweet treat, or a sumptuous meal for your friends and family and share the joy!
〰️
5. Create new memories and take family photos online with everyone dressed up in their best! (or maybe even a Hari Raya music video!)
〰️
In spite of dark times, let's celebrate what matters as we stand strong together! From all of us here at Buzzhivesg, wishing all Muslim friends a blessed and joyous Eid, Selamat Hari Raya!
