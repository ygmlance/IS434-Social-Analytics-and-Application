‘You’ve stolen a pizza my ❤️’
This is the part I do enjoy about being in lockdown - getting to spend time with my babies. Besides evening bike rides, we have been doing a ton of baking and cooking together. I’ve always believe the bond between children and parents happens in the kitchen - teaching them our “ways” - how to cut an onion, peel a potato etc. It’s a way for us to shape their taste palettes. And the stories that happens...love listening to them chatter. Friday nights are designated pizza nights in our household. I truly believe they enjoy eating what they make cause they themselves believe it’s the best thing they have ever created (which is usually a mountain of cheese). My oldest loves making the dough from scratch so we’ve been experimenting with different online recipes. If you didn’t know, kneading dough is a great way for them to refine their fine motor skills for the little ones. Btw I award extra points to each kid if they put vegetables on their pizza. And with yesterday’s creations...I was #winning. And we have a dance party while waiting for our pizzas to be done ✌️#freshfromtheoven
