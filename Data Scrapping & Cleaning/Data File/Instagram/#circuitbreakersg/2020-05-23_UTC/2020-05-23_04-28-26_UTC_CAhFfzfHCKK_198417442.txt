💖Black Sesame Wholemeal Bread💖

First attempt working with wholemeal flour. Read that it is harder to use this flour because it doesn’t rise as much, absorbs more water and dough is more sticky to knead. But I guess this was not too bad for a first attempt? Added my favourite Taiwanese black sesame spread as a filling too! 😍
