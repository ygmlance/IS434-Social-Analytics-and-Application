Day 46 of circuit breaker, I let Leodys play with bubble wrap. I was surprised that he is not scare and keep laughing. When we pop finish, he still ask for more. I was quite scare so ask my mom to help me. I like to let him experience with different things to expose him. Let him learn how to squeeze a bubble wrap to pop it, enhance his hand strength. Always loved to buy milk powder from @shopee_sg, they always protect the milk powder with many bubble wraps. So fast the delivery is fast and safe. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #21monthsold #sensoryplay #sensoryplayideas #bubblewrap #bubblewrappopping #havingfun #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
