Yay it’s the weekend! How’s everyone holding up😄We are staying home these days until future notice here in Singapore. That kinda send most of us into baking and cooking these days 😄 there’s even an islandwide cooking contest called #stayhomecookoff going on!
.
This contest is initiated by @ch8sg, a local mandarin tv channel airing a reality cooking show weekly called #宅星刀叉战 (with English subtitle). In the show, a pair of local celebrities whips up dishes in a limited time upon receiving a mystery ingredient. Prepare your dish that was shared on the show and hashtag #stayhomecookoff to join in the fun!

Here’s my take on @leeteng0530 Taiwanese Egg Pancake Roll #台式蛋饼, with a twist using #butterflypea to add some natural colour to the eggroll skin 🥰  Happy weekend all! Stay safe🥰
