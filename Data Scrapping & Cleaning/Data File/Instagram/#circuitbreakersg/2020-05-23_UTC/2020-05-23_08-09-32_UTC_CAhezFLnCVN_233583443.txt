Real VS Fake. Babies are so dramatic aren’t they?

The first video is Cing freaking about something we just can’t figure out yet. Sometimes when he’s just staring at someone and not moving a muscle, and it gets really hard to gauge his reaction. We’ve seen him turn that motionless stare into smiles and also like this one I’ve posted.

Second video is him trying to reach for my phone. I chose not to hand it to him because it’s MY stuff. It gets real hard to resist because of that cry face. I remember using “cries” to manipulate my parents, so I guess it’s payback time LOLOL.
