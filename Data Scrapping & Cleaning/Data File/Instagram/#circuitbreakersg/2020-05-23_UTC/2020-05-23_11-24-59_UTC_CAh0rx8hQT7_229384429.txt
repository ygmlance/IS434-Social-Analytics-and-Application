Eid is a special day to celebrate with your friends and family. However, this year, due to CCB (community circuit breaker in Sg), Eid has become the new norm.

If you strip away all the fanfare, the Eid season is really all about one important thing: The togetherness of family. 
So this Eid, let us look at the glass as half-full. It may be a quieter celebration with just the 3 of us, but we are looking forward to have virtual visiting sessions tomorrow with our extended family members.

Let us also take this opportunity to improve our ties with one another and continue to celebrate harmoniously, even if it has to be done virtually. This is what makes us unique, and what makes every festivity so beautiful and special. This is a symbol of pride for all who are celebrating this auspicious day.

Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri / Eid Mubarak to all our Muslim viewers.

EiD 2020 may be different, but it will truly be one for the books for us to remember. Enjoy!
