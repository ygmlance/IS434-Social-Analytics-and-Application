#dinner ~ anyhow-cook still decent 😜

This is probably the 3rd/4th time trying to cook full Chinese home cook food... But it’s likely MY personal expectations ... that I had to create up-to-my 👀“VISUAL-STANDARD” 😅

Pretty proud of my version of “Anyhow-like-restaurant-standard #vegdish ” #broccoli #mushrooms #mincedmeat on #tofu ~ before Covid, Circuitbreaker, I don’t think I cook/bake more than once a month!! Guess I’ve Chalked my lifetime of #cookingquota in these 4 weeks!
