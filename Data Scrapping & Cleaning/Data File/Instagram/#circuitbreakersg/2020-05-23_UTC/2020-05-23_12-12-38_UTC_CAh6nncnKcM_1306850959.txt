Was always keen to try scenery chocolate art work and finally did it! Omg so so challenging especially drawing the coconut tree because it kept smudging into the sky. I felt so drained at completion but also a huge sense of satisfaction! Hope you will feel therapeutic looking at this art piece. We all miss such relaxing vacations!
