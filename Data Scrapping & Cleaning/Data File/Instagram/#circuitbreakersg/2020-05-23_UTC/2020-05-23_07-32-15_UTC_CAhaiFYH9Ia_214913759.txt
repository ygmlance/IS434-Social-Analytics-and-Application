According to the Lunar calendar, 2020 is a Chinese leap year, with 2 lunar April. It is a Hainanese custom (correct me if I’m wrong) to either get a piece of jewellery, a pair of pants or make Da Kak Lao for our parents. It is believed that in doing so, it brings good luck and health to elderly parents. Since the shops are mostly closed during #circuitbreakersg, I decided to attempt this #hainanesedelight.  The 3 corners of Da Kak Lao symbolise 福,如,寿. It is filled with grated coconut cooked in brown sugar and gula melaka, peanut, ginger (I used lots of it) and white sesame. The challenge in making this is really the skin. Ratio of flour and water has to be just right in order to achieve a soft and chewy texture. @bryanwwong I did it in the second batch!! Thanks for the tips!!#hainanesefood #hainanfood #traditionalfood
