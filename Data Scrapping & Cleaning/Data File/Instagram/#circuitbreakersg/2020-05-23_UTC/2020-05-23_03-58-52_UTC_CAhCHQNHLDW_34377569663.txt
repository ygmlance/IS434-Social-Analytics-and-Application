Greetings to home faraway - our migrant friends drew these greetings to their loved ones at home. The greetings might not arrive on time but the love contained in these messages will never expire.

We are starting to receive artworks from the art care-packs that we distributed. Look out for more artworks to be posted soon! #art4SGMW
