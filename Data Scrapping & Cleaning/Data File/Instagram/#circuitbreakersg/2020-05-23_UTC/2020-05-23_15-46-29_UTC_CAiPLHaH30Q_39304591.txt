Our favourite cocktail bars are still closed but that doesn’t mean we can’t treat ourselves to a fancy tipple! 🍸 My Bloody Mary is made with all your usual trimmings but with fresh puréed tomatoes 🍅 instead of canned tomato juice, a touch of olive brine & a dash of dill!! #BloodyMary is typically a brunch beverage but it was a refreshing evening cocktail after our grilled chicken dinner (see instastory... omg it was so good. Loving our new electric grill from @philipssg.) How do you like your Bloody Mary? 🍅
