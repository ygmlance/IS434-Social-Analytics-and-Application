【Recipe】Since I’m working on another project and can’t post dinner, I’ll go straight to dessert 😝. #honeybeeweekendmeals 
Mangoes are in season! If you’re not already enjoying them, you should. Love it during ‘summer’ time when there’s abundance of fruits and at a very good price too. I bought mine 🥭 for a dollar each haha.

Mango pudding🥭🍮 is probably one of the easiest dessert to make. No eggs, no whipping, just heat up, blend and combine. Plus a little patience to wait for the pudding to set of course. 
The kids love it and inhale it like water🙈😂 But it’s really good and a perfect treat anytime. 
These are so smooth and creamy, just how a perfect pudding should be. Not like agar agar texture or cheesecake dense. Just delightfully light , creamy custard like texture that’s barely set and literally melts away in the mouth. Yum. 
I made mine in proportion to the amount of mango flesh I got out from one. Feel free to adjust to the amount your mango yields...if you get what I mean. 
Happy making and eating pudding guys!

Makes about 7X4 ounce ramekins 
4 gelatine sheets, soak in tap water till soften, remove and set aside 
320g mango flesh, blend till puree
400ml fresh full cream milk
160ml whipping / heavy cream
55g caster sugar

Method
1) In a sauce pan, add in milk, cream and sugar over Low heat. Bring to barely simmering and off the heat. Stir till sugar had dissolved.
2) Add in the gelatine and mix well. Let it cool for 10 mins before adding in the mango purée.
3) Stir in the mango purée, you can sieve for a finer texture, but I’m too lazy.
4. Carefully divide the mixture into ramekins and chill in the fridge for 4hrs or till set. 
5) Top with more mango cubes and serve chilled. Enjoy!! ——————————————
