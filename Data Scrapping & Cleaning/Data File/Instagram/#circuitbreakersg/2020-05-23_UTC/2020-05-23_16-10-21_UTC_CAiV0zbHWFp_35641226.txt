I have nothing much to share except photos of what I've cooked in the past 40-something days. Says alot about how I've been spending my CB days huh. 😏

So there - prawn noodle soup! Cholesterol-laden because of the broth but methinks it's worth it because it is so flavourful.

Gu gu jit pai (once in a long while), okay right? 🤭
