Every part of our children have been knitted together by God. I love that image of how the great, amazing God has carefully, tenderly made us.
Each stay-in weekend brings with it some chaos for me, especially when I prefer order and uninterrupted time to do anything at all, because each of my kids have different needs pulling at me.
Hereâ€™s a reminder for myself - and you too, friend - to see the beauty in the chaos, and behold the wonderful creation who are bouncing off of our sofas, climbing onto our chairs, and leaving trails of their Duplos all over the place ðŸ˜‰
