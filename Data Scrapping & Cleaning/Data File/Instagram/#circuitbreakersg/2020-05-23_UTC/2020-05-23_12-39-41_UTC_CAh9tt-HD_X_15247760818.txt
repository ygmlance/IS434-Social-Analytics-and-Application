Rainbow spicy salmon bowl 🌈🍣🍚 with Japanese cucumber 🥒, sweet and juicy Taiwanese tangerines 🍊 from @laosinkianchoon, avocado slices 🥑, pineapple cubes 🍍, yellow onion 🧅 and roasted garlic 🧄. .
Salmon’s really fresh and chunky from @coldstoragesg (CS Fresh) - well worth the price tag! Roasted the salmon skin-up with extra virgin olive oil in the oven so that the skin will be crispy. .
Did not have sriracha sauce so made the spicy dressing with chilli sauce, sesame peanut sauce, sesame oil, balsamic vinegar, mayonnaise and light soya sauce. It’s so delish!
.
This is so easy, anyone can do this and it’s tasty too. Cheers to healthy eating and a long weekend at home 🏡!! .
