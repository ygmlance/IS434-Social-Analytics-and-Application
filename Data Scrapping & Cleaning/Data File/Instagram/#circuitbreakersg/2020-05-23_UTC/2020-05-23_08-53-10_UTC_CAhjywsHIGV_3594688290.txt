When the circuit breaker period ends after June 1, Singapore will reopen in phases. In Phase 1, employees are going to return to workplaces only if they need specialised equipment and machinery that cannot be accessed from home, or if they need to fulfil legal requirements.

This means that most employees working in an office setting will continue working from home. All these workplace measures are critical in our fight against Covid-19 - they will reduce the need for daily movement of people, and minimise the risks of the virus flaring up again.
