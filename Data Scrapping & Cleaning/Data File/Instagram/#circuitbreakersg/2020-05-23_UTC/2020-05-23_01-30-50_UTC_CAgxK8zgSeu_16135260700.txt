With over 300 million receptors in their nose, it can be a pretty squeamish affair for a dog to have their snout touched. Getting them used to the hand is good behavior training for vet visits. It also helps when you are desensitising them to muzzles or cones. The best part? You can be creative and get them to help out around the house, with closing doors and cabinets!
