W Acai is a new acai bowl shop located at SingPost Centre, beside Paya Lebar MRT.

I really enjoyed the “Iron Man” ($6.80) bowl, which consists of fresh blueberries, kiwis, bananas, granolas, and almonds.

The acai was smoothly blended, and I liked that it was not too sweet.

The generous amounts of fresh toppings made this a very hearty and refreshing treat!
