Last weekend #ALsiblings had fun with this #DIY icing cookie kit which I ordered from @ourhappystorysg

Waited for #babyAL to nap so that he wouldn't disturb our session. I didn't read instructions (oops!ðŸ¤­) - the cookies were supposed to be at room temperature but we did it fresh out from the fridge. So I suppose that might have caused the icing sugar pooling

Luckily it ended up OK with some touch up. And... the kids didn't leave sprinkles for me so I had to make do with sprinkles crumbs ðŸ˜‚
