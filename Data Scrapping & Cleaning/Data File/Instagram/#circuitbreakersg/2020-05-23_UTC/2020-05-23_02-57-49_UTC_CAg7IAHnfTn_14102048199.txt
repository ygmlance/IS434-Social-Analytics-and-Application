Thank you @estherlaoshi for the meaningful Chinese storytelling session this morning. We were early so my boys had a first-hand experience of cultivating patience while waiting for the story to start 😂 .

In the story《安的种子》, a wise monk gives a seed each to three young monks. The children eagerly plant their own seed separately, but when their attitude leads to very different results, they discover an important lesson about patience...
.
Looking forward (patiently) to more stories for my kids!
