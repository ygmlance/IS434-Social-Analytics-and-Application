Happy weekend brunch for the family. #honeybeeweekendbreakfast 
Used my own home baked soft bread loaf, soften cream cheese, almond butter and black sesame paste to doodle @webarebears.official . It’s been awhile since I last did this and it took me longer then usual 😅🙄 不行了 #honeybeesweetsfoodfun 
But the kids love it, so no regrets on that😁 好玩

Served along with pineapple sausages (so yummy), creamy scrambled eggs and avocado. Simple eats we all enjoy. 
Sad that I don’t have much fruits left...literally used frozen strawberries for this 😂🍓 “Mummy, why the strawberries so cold!” Anyway, have a great weekend ahead guys! #honeybeemakesbreakfast
