A complete seal comprises of its imprint and the relatively overlooked side carvings. The simplest form of side carving is the artist’s signature, sometimes also with the year of execution. More proficient artists will attempt to imbue the carving with calligraphic beauty and carve passages that elaborate on the meanings of the imprinted text.⁣
