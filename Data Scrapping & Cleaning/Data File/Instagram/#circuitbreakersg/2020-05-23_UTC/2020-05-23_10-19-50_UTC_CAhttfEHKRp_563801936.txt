This was the end product - I think it turned out not too bad for a first attempt! It got abit smudged cause those tiny hands couldn't wait for it to dry completely

Aly decorated the candy🍬 and heart❤️, Alroy did the ice creams 🍦with my help in colouring the base

And the cookie set actually gave 3 days of value -
It ended up as bribes 😜
"If you behave, I give you cookie later"

Day 1 : decorate
Day 2 : they had one cookie each
Day 3 : they had one cookie each

Next time round I'm going to stretch for 3 days of cookie bribing, in return for good behaviour 😂
