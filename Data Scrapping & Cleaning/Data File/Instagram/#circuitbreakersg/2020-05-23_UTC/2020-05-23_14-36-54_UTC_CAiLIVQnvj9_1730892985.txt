DIY SELF PORTRAIT TIP #2.
⭐️ Hold something so you don’t have to think about what to do with your hands .
⭐️ Position yourself in front of a window for good lighting and that extra sparkle in your eyes
⭐️ Smile or imagine someone is 30min late for your date. I choose to smile because I’m that person running late for dates 😝
