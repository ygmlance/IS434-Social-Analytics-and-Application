//|~*BOOK REVIEW*~|\\ Based on a photo taken in the “golden era” of Hollywood, this fiction novel by Singapore’s renowned modern writer, @amandaleekoe, follows the divergence and convergence of the lives of three women in entertainment, Anna May Wong, Marlene Dietrich, and Leni Riefenstahl. Their paths unfurl quite uniquely as Marlene becomes a leading star in Hollywood, Anna May combats racial stereotyping and fights for her break to be a lead in a movie and Leno finds herself entangled in politics in Nazi Germany. I thought the took a few tangents to follow secondary characters that didn’t move the main plot along which made the book drag and unnecessarily long. Overall this was a good story with strong messages about race, gender, and sexuality pre-World War II. Recently, I watched Hollywood on @netflixsg where I was thrilled to see Anna May Wong’s character appear in the series. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 - @lroseinsg 📕📙📗📘
