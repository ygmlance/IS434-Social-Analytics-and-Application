What’s the workout?
Strong Nation with Jerry
Saturday, 23 May 2020, 17:00-18:00
Strong Nation is a form of high-intensity interval training, where classes utilize boot camp choreography infused with music to gradually drive intensity that culminates in a total body workout. Think of burpees, pushups, and other high-impact moves synced to adrenaline-pumping tunes.

Zumba with Jerry – 
Sunday, 24 May 2020, 17:00-18:00
We take the "work" out of workout, by mixing low-intensity and high-intensity moves for an interval-style, calorie-burning dance fitness party. Once the Latin and World rhythms take over, you'll see why Zumba® Fitness classes are often called exercise in disguise. Super effective? Check. Super fun? Check and check
