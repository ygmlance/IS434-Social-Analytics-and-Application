Weekends are for relaxing. I like my schedule loose, just like my tea.
⠀⠀
I still have a bunch of tea bags left, however I have switched to loose tea leaves that we get from bulk stores like @scoopwholefoods_sg  and @thesourcesg and @unpackt.sg ⠀⠀
This is a great alternative to going single-use free when you bring your own containers, even though they provide paper bags as that too is single use and creates waste. ⠀⠀
Between stasher bags and containers, I’m generally set for my once a month trip to the bulk store to get a variety of tea, condiments, and cleaning essentials.
⠀⠀
Do you go to the bulk-store? Which one is your favourite? What do you normally buy when you are there?
