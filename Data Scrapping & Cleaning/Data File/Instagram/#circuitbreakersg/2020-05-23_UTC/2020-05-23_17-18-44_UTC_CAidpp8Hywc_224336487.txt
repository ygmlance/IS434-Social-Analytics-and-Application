Happy birthday @avenuesingapore.

If not for where the world is at this point, we would all be at Avenue now and the anniversary celebrations would have just hit full swing. We would be hustling @belinda.betz or @jimmyrjuarez__ for an extra table or two and seeing @edwinfoofangwei walk in at this moment now with his model friends. I even bet there would be some best dressed contest or most glamorous outfit and the @studio155sg team would be on the floor looking for that perfect person.

Then I would see @patrickoverseas standing at the end of the room in quiet profound observation of everything happening. @jasonstrauss would probably be here too, and have a table with all these very beautiful people from i dont know where. And for sure, @patrickandrewlang and @robotda would be behind the dj console and maybe it would have been @peggygou_ djing and @byden and @kya_sg busy taking care of her and everything else we don't ever see happening. 
But it ain't happening.

Till we meet again @avenuesingapore. For now, thank you for the memories, for being so classy and lovely and for being our favourite hangout. 
Happy 1st birthday.
