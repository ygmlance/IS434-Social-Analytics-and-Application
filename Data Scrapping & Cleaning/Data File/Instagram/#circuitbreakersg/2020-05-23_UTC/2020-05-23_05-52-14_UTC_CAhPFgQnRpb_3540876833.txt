#Day47 of #CircuitBreakerSG. It has been a productive #WFH week filled with discussions with clients as we take the planning stages of their projects forward.  This is version #2 of a bedroom moodboard for a lady client who would like a sophisticated sanctuary in her bedroom with a soothing grey palate accented by feminine pink touches. #stayhome #stayhealthy #staysafe #staystrong
