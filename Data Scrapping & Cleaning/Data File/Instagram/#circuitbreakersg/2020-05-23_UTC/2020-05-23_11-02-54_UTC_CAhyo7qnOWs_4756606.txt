Day 47/56•Stayhome Dinner 
Keeping it real simple with Kbros fave chicken rice! 
4 full thighs, a pot of fragrant rice, homemade ginger-scallion oil, partial homemade chilli dip...plus achar & preserved mustard leaves fr a nearby market (the grocery stall boss own-made, super nice! ❤). Happy Diners!
