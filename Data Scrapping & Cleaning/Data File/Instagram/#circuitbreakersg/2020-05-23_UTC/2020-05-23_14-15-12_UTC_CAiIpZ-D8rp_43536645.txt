Circuit Breaker Day 47: Egypt today. This is a special place for me, itâ€™s the last country I have been with my bestie. She is not here anymore, but will forever live within me. To my friends that are experiencing losses, I know the heartbreak of missing love ones. Remembering the good times and  keep them in our hearts. We shall meet them again when we are done with our duties. #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakersgchallenge #sgunited #traveltheworld
