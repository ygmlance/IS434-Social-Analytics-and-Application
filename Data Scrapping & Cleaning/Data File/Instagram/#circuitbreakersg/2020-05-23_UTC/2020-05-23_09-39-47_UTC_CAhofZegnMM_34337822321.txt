Double up your Pilates repertoire with weights and get a core and arm workout at the same time. I also included a yoga block as a spacer between my inner thighs to engage the pelvic floor muscles and deep stabilizers of the torso. Throw in a spine twist as you rotate your torso with a weighted jab cross. Hey, thatâ€™s bringing Pilates principles to the boxing world!
