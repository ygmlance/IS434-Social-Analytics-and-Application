Bollinger James Bond Limited Edition 2011, in commemoration of the 25th Bond movie (aptly named in these times, No Time to Die). Came in a 007-worthy glass-covered box, complete with hydraulic hinges. 2011 grand cru blanc de noirs, the first ever vintage made from 100% pinot noir grapes and sourced from a single grand cru vineyard in AyÌˆ. Like green apples and honey, so incredibly delightful and goes with just about anything.
