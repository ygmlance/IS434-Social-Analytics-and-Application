Covid-19 Circuit Breaker - Day 21.
Good morning to another new week.
Enjoying cool early morning fresh air and soothing hot mulberry green tea with calm radio spa music in our cozy mini garden of greenery and chirping little birds 😌😇.
Pray for protection from Covid19 and wishing all a blessed week ahead! 🙏🏻😍😍
