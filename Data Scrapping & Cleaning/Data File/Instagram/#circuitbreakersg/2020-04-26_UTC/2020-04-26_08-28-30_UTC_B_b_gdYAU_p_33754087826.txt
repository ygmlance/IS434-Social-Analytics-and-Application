Scallion pancake 葱油饼

One of my favourite street food in Taiwan! Can’t got there right now but I thought I could make myself one and feel like I’m on a mini vacation.

It’s amazing how the flavour of food can transport you to a different place and time with the first bite.

I couldn’t resist and made myself a second serving but this time topped with an egg. Extra burst of umami especially when the yolk drips into the crevices of the pancake creating that perfect bite, Oof.

What’s you’re favourite street food? I could make them in my next cooking sessions ✌🏻.
