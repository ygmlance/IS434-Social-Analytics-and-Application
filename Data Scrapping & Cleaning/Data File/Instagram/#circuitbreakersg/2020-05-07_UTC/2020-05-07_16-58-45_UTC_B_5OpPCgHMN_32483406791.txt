I cooked only the soup. The rest was by Queen who was trying to show me that one pot food can be really nice. So that’s what she did for this meal—one pot chicken rice. I must say it’s pretty damn good. 👌🏻 I made the cabbage soup to complement her chicken rice. I mean, that’s what chicken rice stall usually serve ain’t it? 😆 I think we make a pretty good team.

Maybe I should make a non one pot version for her one day. ♥️ #cookedbyqueen #cookedbycarlsson #hainanesechickenrice #singaporechickenrice #chickenrice  #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakercookingchallenge #workfromhome #workfromhomelife #foodvlog #foodvlogger #foodiesg #sgunited #sgstrong #stayathome #stayathomechallenge #stayathomesg #homecookedfood #homechefmeals #homechef #cookathome #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #homecooked #homecooking #sgfooddiary #StayHomeWithAscott
