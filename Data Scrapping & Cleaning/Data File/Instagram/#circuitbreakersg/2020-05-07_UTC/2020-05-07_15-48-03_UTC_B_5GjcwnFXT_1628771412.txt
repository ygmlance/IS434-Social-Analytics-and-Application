After my first attempt making cookies today, I think itâ€™s easier to bake cookies than cakes. ðŸ˜€
Attempt my Version of chocolate chip and plain cookies with a very simple recipe. (Modified)
coz I didnâ€™t want Missy to take Too much chocolates at this age,So I only add like 1 chocolates chip into the batter when itâ€™s ready to be baked and left some plain ones for her....
While baking ,Me Always Anxiously peeking through the glass window , waiting for those little doughy stuff turn golden brown in the oven (yup,  noobbaker is like that one .)
One moment you see lumps of fresh dough,
Next moment those lumps become chaoTaðŸ˜­
How not to feel nervous? ðŸ˜…
Next batch, I stayed by the oven haha, Glad it turn out pretty and surprisingly yummy .( mine is the crispy cookie version ,not the chewy type )
If you are a noobbaker like me ðŸ˜›and wana try:
-ingredients
170g all purpose flour
85g-90g fine sugar 
125g salted butter at room temperature 
1 egg at room temperature 
1tsp vanilla Essence 
1/3 baking soda (I aga aga one)
Chocolate chips (didnâ€™t have  so I use a chocolate bar and cut into small pieces)
Oh and I put my dough in the fridge for about 30 to 45 mins coz it was abit Soft to handle... .
