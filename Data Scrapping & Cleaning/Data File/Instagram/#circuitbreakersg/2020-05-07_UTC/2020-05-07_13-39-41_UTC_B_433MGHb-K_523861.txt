Didn’t get around to brining the chicken last night so decided to go with one of Jaime Oliver’s recipe - milk braised chicken. We couldn’t find sage, so used rosemary instead. The aroma was intoxicating and the sauce ridiculously SHIOK! Paired it with cauliflower rice & corn. #jamieoliver #cauliflowerrice #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakersingapore
