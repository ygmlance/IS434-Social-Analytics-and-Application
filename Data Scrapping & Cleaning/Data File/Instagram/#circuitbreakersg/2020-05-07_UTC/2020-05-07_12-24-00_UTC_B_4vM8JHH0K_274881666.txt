Mystery Thursdays III (Virtual edition)
Theme: Something old, something new 
Budget: ~$70 (for 1 pax)
.
|Something old (for you), something new (for me)|
Concise and to the point.
.
Lunch was pretty much the same way - just the right portions, hitting the right notes.
. 
K must have planted a camera in my home - I have told the better half about my desire to try this #thevar express set lunch just 2 days ago! He wasnâ€™t keen, and so I let it pass. What a pleasant outcome.
.
Virtual lunch was a great idea - almost felt like we were in the same room (sans make-up).
