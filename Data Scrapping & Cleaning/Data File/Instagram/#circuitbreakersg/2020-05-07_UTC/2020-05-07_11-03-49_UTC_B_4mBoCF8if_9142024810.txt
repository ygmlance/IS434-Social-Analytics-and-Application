Coffee break with apple caramel butter cake. Part of coping with the lockdown is pretending you are cafe-hopping, no? ‚Å£‚Å£

This turned out really, really well and has made me feel slightly better about my dislike for baking. It was actually kind of perfect and one of the best cakes I've ever had - fluffy and light and buttery and moist all at the same time. Wasn't too sweet either. ‚Å£‚Å£

Tbh this started as an upside down apple cake but somehow in the oven the apple slices that were arranged on the base in a beautiful swirly pattern floated up and went all over the cake?? Mysteries of baking üòê Can more experienced bakers please enlighten me? Was it because the caramel layer wasn't thick enough and the apples didn't 'stick'? ‚Å£‚Å£
