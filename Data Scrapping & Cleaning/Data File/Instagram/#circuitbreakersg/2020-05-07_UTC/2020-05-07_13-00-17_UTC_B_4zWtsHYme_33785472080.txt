Marques de Murrieta Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial 2009..
.
“Huh? No more already?” .
.
Young wine that we decided to kill early just for fun. 
Dark blackcurrant and blackberries - great dimension to the fruit. Strong oak influence with added spice. Sweet velvety tannins with a very smooth texture. Long finish. Full bodied and extroverted but well balanced and not off putting. We drank so fast we were wondering if there was less than 750ml in the bottle😅. Lots of stuffing in here and will open the next one in a few years to see how it develops. .
