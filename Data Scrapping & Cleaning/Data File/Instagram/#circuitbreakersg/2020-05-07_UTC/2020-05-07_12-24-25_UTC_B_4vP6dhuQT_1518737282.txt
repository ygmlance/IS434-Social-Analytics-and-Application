Baking No.4 - first attempt to make kueh!  I choose to try a natural 3 colour 9 layers kuih lapis 🤍layer = coconut milk 💚 layer = pandan 💙 layer = bluepea flower.
Super challenging without the right pan🤣 luckily it turned out not bad! Hope next time can reallly peel layer by layer #cherrycc__bakes #circuitbreakersg #stayhomestaysafe #newhobbymaybe  #ilovetoeat  #sgfood #九层糕 #asiankueh #pandan #bluepeaflower #coconutmilk #stayhomewithascott
