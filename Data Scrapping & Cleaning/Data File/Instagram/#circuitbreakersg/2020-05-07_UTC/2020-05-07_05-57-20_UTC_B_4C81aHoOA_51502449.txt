Tagliatelle al Ragu. In my recent travel to Bologna, I sampled upon the traditional Tagliatelle al Ragu and - oh boy, as you know I am not fond of tomato-based pasta, but that ragu is just to die for - I enjoyed it. I have fresh tagliatelle in the fridge, and since it is public holiday today, I tried cracking at it. Cooked the ragu for two hours and it is just packed with so much flavour from that minced beef and sofritto, with the white wine and passata (tomato purée). After two hours, I taste a forkful and I am taken back to Bologna! Loving this dish; now I gotta run tonight to shed off these unnecessary calories.
