Tonkichi tonkatsu! Think I first ate this at Suntec City when it got built circa 1996? When something tastes good you just keep going back to it. There are a lot more tonkatsu specialty restos now but this still hits the spot for me every time! (I have been eating home cooked every alternate day or so, but def still doing takeouts/deliveries cuz while I still can afford to support my fav restos I should!)
