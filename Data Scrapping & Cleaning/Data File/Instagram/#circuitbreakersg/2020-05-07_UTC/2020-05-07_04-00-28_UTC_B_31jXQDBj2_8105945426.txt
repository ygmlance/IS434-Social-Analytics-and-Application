“The mind is everything. What you think you become.” – Buddha ⁠
⁠
Vesak is an important Buddhist festival. ⁠
It is also known as Wesak or Buddha Day. ⁠
It is a celebration of Buddha's birthday and, for some Buddhists, ⁠
marks his enlightenment. ⁠
⁠
⁠
The Writes Group wishes everyone a Happy Vesak Day!⁠
