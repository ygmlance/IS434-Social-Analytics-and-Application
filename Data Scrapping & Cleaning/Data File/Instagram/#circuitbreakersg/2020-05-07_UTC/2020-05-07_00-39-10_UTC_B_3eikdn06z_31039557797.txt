■ We often neglect the lateral hip muscles during training. However, those muscles are integral for hip stability, in many functional movements (i.e. walking, running, and and other type of single leg or lateral movements)
• Weakness of these hip muscles may cause hip hiking (lateral tilting of the pelvis during walking/running), and will also lead to injury to the knee joint and/or lower back.
• Strength & stability at the hip will allow for better force production and transfer to/from the legs, and reduce risk of injuries along the kinetic chain
.
■ The Pelvic drop
- The Pelvic Drop is an exercise that targets these very muscles, specifically the Gluteus Medius (side of hip/buttock)
.
■ How?
- Place your hands on your hips
(use one hand to support yourself against a wall if required)
- Lift one leg off the ground (slight bend at knee)
- Allow hip of the lifted leg to slowly "drop" or "lower" (Notice the pelvis push towards the opposite side)
- Squeeze the lateral hip/buttock muscles of the stance leg, to level out the hips (Notice the pelvis pushes back)
- Perform 10~15 reps/side, 1min rest/set, 2~3 sets
.
PS. You should be feeling this at the side of your hips/buttocks
