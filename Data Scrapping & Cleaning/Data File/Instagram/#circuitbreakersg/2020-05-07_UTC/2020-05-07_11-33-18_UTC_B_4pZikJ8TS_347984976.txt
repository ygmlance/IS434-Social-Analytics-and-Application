For a sumptuous and hearty meal, we had the Chicken & Salmon Teriyaki and Pork Sumiyaki Bundle which is pretty value for money! You can distinctively taste the strong smoky flavor of the grilled salmon fillet & chicken thigh, enriched by the sweet sauce and aroma of the white sesame seeds. The toppings consists of onsen tamago and pickled cabbage which provides creaminess to the rice as well as some refreshing crunch and acidity to cut through the strong flavors. Thank you @chefavenuesg for feeding us well! .
