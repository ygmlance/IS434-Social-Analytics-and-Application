One of the things I tried to keep the kids occupied was to create a picnic experience.⁠
⁠
A ground sheet⁠
Some cut fruit⁠
Some biscuits⁠
Some stuffed toys to make a party⁠
⁠
Lasted a good 30 minutes before they started getting distracted.⁠
⁠
One more for the list of things to keep them occupied while at home.⁠
