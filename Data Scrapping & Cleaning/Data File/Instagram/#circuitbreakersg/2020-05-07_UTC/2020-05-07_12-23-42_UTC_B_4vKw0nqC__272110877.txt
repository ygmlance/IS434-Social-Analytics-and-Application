Day 30. A good day for clearing laundry. Had a no carb breakfast with our fav omelette. Dinner - Hakkaido soup curry with vegetables. Managed to clear a lot of food these few days. So that I can go grocery shopping tomorrow. ðŸ˜‚ Missy has since used to her HBL routine and busy with the wk her Dad has assigned her. Lots of housewk done so that I can focus on meals prep. It is Friday tomorrow! #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #instadaily
