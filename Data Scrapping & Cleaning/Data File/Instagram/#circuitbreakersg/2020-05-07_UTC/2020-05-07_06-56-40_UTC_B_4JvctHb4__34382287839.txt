Our restaurant partners have been selected to represent home-grown businesses and will provide MajulahMovement Set Meals 🍱 cooked with fresh, wholesome ingredients. 
We’ll be rotating orders from each restaurant to ensure a variety of cuisines for our beneficiaries.

Due to varying costs of our partners, a $10 donation will fund between 1-2 set meals. 
The cost includes all logistical support and delivery.
