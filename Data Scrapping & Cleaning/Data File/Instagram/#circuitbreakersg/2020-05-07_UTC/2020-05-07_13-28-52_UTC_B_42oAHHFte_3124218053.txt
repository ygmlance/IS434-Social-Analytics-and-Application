Day 31 of Singapore’s Circuit Breaker period.

Took my time with this illustration. Changed her hair colour twice, designed and altered her outfit four times, her earrings eleven times, the plant three times.  Okay, maybe I am fickle. But it is only during these strange times when we are not rushing to do “things”, I just let this happen at its own pace. And I found that I really like creating this way- no brief, no deadline. Just doing my stuff. .

Btw, just realised that tonight is the last #supermoon of the year. Stay safe and keep well, my friends.💕 .
