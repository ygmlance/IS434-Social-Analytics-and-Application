Happy Vesak Day to all our friends. Here’s a workout we did with the vivacious @nattylifts just a few days ago. No zoom video work out today? No problem, we’ve got you covered. Do this in your own time, just follow the moves in the video and repeat to desired reps (at least 3 is recommended). Hope you’ll have as much sweat, oops, fun as we did. #blessfriend .
