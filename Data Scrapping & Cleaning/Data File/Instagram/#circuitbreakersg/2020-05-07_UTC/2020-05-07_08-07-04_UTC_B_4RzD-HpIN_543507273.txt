My ❤️+🥵lol.. How’s everyone doing? I have lost count on the number of days we have been in CB 😅 less than 1 month to go now but what will we be going back to? Things ain’t going to be the same for sure. 
But I know I wouldn’t want to be in lockdown other than with these 2. Still alive 😅 Quality time together at least ❤️😘 #thekongs #oursweetlittledionne #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #family #loveofmylife
