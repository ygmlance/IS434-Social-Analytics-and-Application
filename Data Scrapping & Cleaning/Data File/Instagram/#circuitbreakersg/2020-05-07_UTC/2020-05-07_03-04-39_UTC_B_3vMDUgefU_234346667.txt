【Recipe】Happy Vesak Day! Even though we can’t really travel or go out. It’s still good to have a break from work nonetheless. 
Made Fruit Sando again since there was still fresh fruits and home baked loaf around. 
Using my home baked carrot loaf (which I’ll be sharing the recipe soon) this time. Sweetened whipped cream with mascarpone cheese (to balance the sweetness and stabilise the cream). And whatever fruits that needs to be eaten😋 Strawberries, Kiwi and rock melon. 
Served with yellow dragon fruit (though the flesh is white🤔) which is really sweet. Scrambled eggs and lettuce. 
Sharing how you can make that mascarpone cream filling. 
200ml whipping cream (usually lightly sweetened for most, pls check)
30g confectioners sugar 
125g mascarpone cheese

Whisk the whipping cream with sugar till thicken. Spoon in the cheese and whip till all is combined and creamy smooth. 
These Fruit Sando is really quite easy to make. The kids love them for breakfast even though it tastes more like desserts to me😅 #honeybeeweekendbreakfast
