#Circuitbreakersg day 31

Vesak Day specials

3 vegetable dish & a meat dish for those who need their protein. 
Corona or non-corona, the CCB has taught me to re-use & reinvent with whatever ingredients I have on hand. More now than ever. I love rummaging through the fridge & pantry. Such a challenge but so much fun too. Being thrifty has taken on a new meaning.  Whatâ€™s your take-away after 1 month of CCB?

Dinner today consist of : ðŸ”º Chinese spinach with eggs
ðŸ”º Cauliflower with carrots ðŸ”º 3 types mushroom stir-fry with garlic & chili padi (great in Vit D, Selenium & antioxidant to prevent wrinkles)
ðŸ”º Sweet & sour pork + chicken (too much left over from last night dinner)
ðŸ”ºSlow cooked radish soup ~
