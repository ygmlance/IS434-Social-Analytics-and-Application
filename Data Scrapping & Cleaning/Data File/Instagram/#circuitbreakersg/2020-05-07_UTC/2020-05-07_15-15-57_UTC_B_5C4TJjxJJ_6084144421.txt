Because of COVID19, I have learnt to appreciate our cleaners more. Especially the elders who tries to make a living by doing what they can - cleaning. It is so risky for them to go out of their house to clean during this period, especially before the CB. I hope our office aunties are all safely at home, and getting some allowance. I think it is so independent of them to still work at an old age. I hope that by that age, I will still be contributing to the society in one way or another. Time to reflect on my retirement job again! Goodnight and Happy Vesak Day! #thankyoucleaners
