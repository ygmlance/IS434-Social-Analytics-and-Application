Yesterday was the last day of my #personal30daychallenge
Wasn't too sure what to expect at the end but this ⤴️ just help reaffirm my journey
.
I miss how I looked and felt in 2016-17, on the scale I hit below 70kg (154lbs), physically my clothes fit better.. I was on the high and on the roll!
.
Then complacency set in and it went downhill from there.. Trying not to let that happen again..💪🏽
.
#Musclemass gain & reduced #bodyfat happened coz i worked out consistently but I did NOT keep an eye on what I ate. It is tough watching what I eat.. I love food too much..
.
While we are still under #restrictedmovementorder in #Singapore🇸🇬 till 1st June, I hope to get that in check.. Gonna make a conscious effort in reducing the 'bad' food in my diet.. ..
