My siblings and I made a no bake oreo cake with JUST 3 INGREDIENTS! 
Wow how magical is that! ðŸ¦„ No bake leh, no oven no problem ( b'cos OREO has all the flour, butter etc alrdy) I saw this recipe online and I thought, why not make one to satisfy my sweet tooth! 
Good things must share, so I've also included the recipe (last picture) for this cake and the rich chocolate ganache. For my version, I used semi-sweet dark chocolate! It's optional to add the chocolate ganache, but the cake drizzled with ganache is on a WHOLE NEW LEVEL!!! (just look at how glossy and reflective the ganache is...like a mirror ðŸ˜­) It's a great cake for chocolate/oreo lovers like myself and its sooooo easy to make! If you are wondering what to give your mum on this coming Mother's Day, why not try making this at home yourself! 
If topped with vanilla ice-cream, it would taste even better! 
Other decorations ideas: fruits, grated chocolate, crushed nuts
