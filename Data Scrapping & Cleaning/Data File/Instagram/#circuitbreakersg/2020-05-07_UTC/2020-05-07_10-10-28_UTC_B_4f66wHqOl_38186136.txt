Few interesting animals that caught my eye while I was walking along the PCN or roadside to buy lunch and groceries - a giant monitor lizard about 40cm long, a family of otters hunting for fishes in the canal during lunchtime (they usually appear in morning wee hours), and some woodpeckers pecking away.

The lockdown has brought more peace and less disturbance to the public spaces so these rarely seen species can be spotted. Then again, perhaps they have always been there, but a lockdown makes us want to walk more, or take a longer route because this is the only time we can be out to move our bodies a little. Thus we slow down, smell the roses and watch the surroundings and become more aware of seeing things we never see before.

Either way, I'm enjoying these sightings! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
