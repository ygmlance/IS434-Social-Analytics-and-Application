Did you know? Japanese rice is clingy and sticky due to its high proportion of starch and moisture content. 
Starch is composed of amylose and amylopectin. 
When the level of amylose is low and level of amylopectin is high, you get sticky rice. 
The unique stickiness of Japanese rice is what makes good sushi and defines the character of Japanese cuisine. .
