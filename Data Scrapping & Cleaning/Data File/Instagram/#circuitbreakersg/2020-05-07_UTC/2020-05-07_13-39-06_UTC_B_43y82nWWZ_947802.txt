Iftar Day 14 
Spiced Chicken Porridge & Epok2 
Prepared bubur for husbang using the leftover chicken from last nightâ€™s chicken rice ðŸ˜‰. I also made some epok2 sardine and kentang in the afternoon, I had afew of that to break my fast. Happy that the pastry turned out nicely blistered, that was the look I was going for. Iâ€™d prolly try the smooth one next time. Cooking while fasting can really be challenging when it comes to seasoning hehe for example, I squeezed too much lime into the sardine and I did not add enough salt into the kentang. But thatâ€™s alright, thereâ€™s always something to learn everyday and Iâ€™m thankful for that.
