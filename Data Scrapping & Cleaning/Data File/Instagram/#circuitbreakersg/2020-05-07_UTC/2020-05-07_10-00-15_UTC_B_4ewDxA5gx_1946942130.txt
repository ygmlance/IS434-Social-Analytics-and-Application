Weâ€™re blessed with many instant noodle options in our supermarkets, but they canâ€™t match up to the real deal. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve collated a list of ramen delivery services for you to satisfy your tonkotsu cravings this Circuit Breaker. Takagi Ramenâ€™s affordable prices start from $6.90 nett and they have unique offerings such as a Salted Egg Soft-Shell Crab Ramen ($12.80). Enishi only has two items on their menu: a peanutty Dan Dan Noodles ($17.90+) and Japanese Dashi Noodle ($17.90+). The only hawker stall on our list, Ramen Taisho, sells fusion tonkotsu ramen creations including a spicy Sambal Ramen ($7.80) inspired by local flavours.
