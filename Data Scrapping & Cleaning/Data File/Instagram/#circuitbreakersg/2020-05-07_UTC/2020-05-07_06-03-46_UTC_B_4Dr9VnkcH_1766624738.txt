So #circuitbreaker has forced me to take things into my own hands.

Art classes ceased, art stores closed.. so I looked for the most accessible materials to make my own paint medium. And I gotta say, the end result surprised me! It is definitely supposed to be less jagged as far as ring pour technique standards go.... but I will take it, la.

Being "limited" in resources forces one think outside the box, and that has been a very good practice for me. Though I have too many doubts and questions of, "But what if it's not the same as how the pros do it?", somehow these negative questions end up being superseded by my growing curiosity and tenacity to just want to create beautiful things. "But Sue, aren't you just itching to do some acrylic pouring? Are you really going to let your lack of resources and experience stop you from scratching this itch?" And so, out came the glue. And some trial and error later, I achieved this.

It leads me to believe that anyone and everyone can be creative. For sure, equip yourself with basic foundations of certain skills. You'll need the building blocks to figure out how to begin. After that, stoke the fire like mad. Practice and practice. Till you love what you're learning and just want more. Sing in harmony with your heart and follow where it leads.

Then let yourself hit roadblocks because by then, if you love it enough, you will find ways and means to forge new paths around them, or break through them even.

From then on, no doubt or limitation can hold you back. That's how innovation begins.
