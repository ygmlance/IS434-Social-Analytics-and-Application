| 6 months old | Minibookwyrm had her 6 month vaccinations yesterday. How is it possible that she's half a year old already?!? Just yesterday she was still kicking in my stomach... wailing naked on my chest... lying swaddled in her crib... learning to self-soothe by sucking her fingers... struggling to hold her head up... starting to flip... My baby girl, don't grow up so fast! ♥️♥️♥️

(And yes, she still loves this hands-up position in the car seat 😂🤷🏻‍♀️😍 First car ride in more than a month! #stayhome #circuitbreakersg)
