HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL MOTHERS AND MOTHERS-TO-BE🌷
———————————————————————————
#1: Mother’s Day is on Sunday!!! Unsure of what to gift her? The best presents are always handmade! Today, we will teach you to fold origami flowers and hearts. You can use them to make a card for your mother, or just simply give her the paper flower! ✿ (Cause we all know that flowers delivery is rarely available due to #circuitbreakersg)

#2: Working out isn't just about the perspiration! Today, we bring to you, a brain workout! It is a Mother's Day quote and let's see who can crack the cryptogram first will get - you, your mum or your mummy friends! OR you all can put your brain together and crack it! Comment down below the answer!

#3: Been whipping up Dalgona coffee? These soufflé pancakes will also use that arm power! This recipe is quite sweet so it can be a nice Mother's Day "cake". Wei Ern cooked 1 at a time since her largest pan couldn't fit both😅. Still works, but you'll have to serve each one the moment it's out of the pan as it deflates quickly! #soufflé #pancakes
