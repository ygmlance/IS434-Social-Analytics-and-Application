I was sceptical that the USDA Prime Black Angus steak from @wolfgangsteakhousesg would travel well — t’was my first time having a good piece of steak delivered to my place instead of eating it at the restaurant. But well, these are CB times. Surprisingly, Wolfgang's Porterhouse Steak ($206 for 900 grams; feeds about 3 pax) rose to the occasion. It came medium-rare, with simple reheating instructions. It was still soft & plush, with a deep, rich sweetness thanks to its 28-day dry-aging process. Delicious, especially drizzled with clarified butter & paired with peas inundated in beefy jus + tender German potatoes. Get this if you wanna spoil mum this circuit breaker Mother’s Day. Otherwise, visit www.8days.sg or https://bit.ly/2YJlrv5 for other tasty, cheaper suggestions, including affordable pies & discounted Peking ducks. .
