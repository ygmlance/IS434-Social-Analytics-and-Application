If you have some flour on hand, why not try making Mee Hoon Kuey! 👩🏻‍🍳
.
Mee Hoon Kuey is hand-torn noodles that’s generally called Pan Mee. Its soft and chewy texture, coupled with the fragrant soup & seasoned minced meat will definitely make you wanting for more 😋
.
📝NOTE from personal experience: Many recipes calls for an egg for the dough, but I usually do without it to achieve a softer texture. Add in water slowly and adjust where necessary. The dough should be quite moist but not sticking to your hands, and remember to let it rest at least 20 minutes before cooking.
