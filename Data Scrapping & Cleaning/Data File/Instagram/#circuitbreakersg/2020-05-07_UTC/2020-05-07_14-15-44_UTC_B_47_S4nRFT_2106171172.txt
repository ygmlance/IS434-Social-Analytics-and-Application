Believe it or not... our dinner (technically itâ€™s supper - already passed dinner time) ðŸ˜‚ Rare for us to have dinner pass 9pm. Korean ramyeon and roasted zucchini flowers stuffed with basil & ricotta cheese. The stuffed zucchini flowers were delicious! We shall do it again next time. #zucchiniflowerstuffed #zucchiniflowers #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #stayhomestaysafe #supper #koreanramen #stayhomewithascott
