Any way you want it, that’s the way you eat it; Don Quijote’s Chipiron or Baby Squid Cooked 3 Ways

Okay so we changed the lyrics to the Journey song just a little bit, FINE! BUT, our baby squid taste good all 3 ways; Fritos, which is fried, Al Ajillo, sautéed in garlic and olive oil, and Negro, in squid ink sauce😋

As delicious as they are simple, get some my DMing or using the CONTACT button on our profile.
