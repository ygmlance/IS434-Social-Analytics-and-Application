ðŸ¥³ Yay, we're (finally) having western food tonight. Thanks to hub for accommodating my request when he's not fancy on western food. I decided to order in from @commongrillbycollins because they're having 50% discount now ðŸ˜». I chose the Sirloin and Lamb set while the hub decided to go for the Crispy Chicken and Fried Fish. Both sets come with Aglio Olio, corn, green salad and mushroom soup. I added the tempura squid for the hub so he can at least have something he likes.
