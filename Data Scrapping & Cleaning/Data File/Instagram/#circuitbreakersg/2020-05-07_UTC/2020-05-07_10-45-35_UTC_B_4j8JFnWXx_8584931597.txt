*Necessity is the mother of invention*

Do you know this saying? It’s a philosophy I grew up with that came from my dad. He was always tinkering around and finding inventive (though not necessarily aesthetically pleasing) solutions for things. I also believe that we push the boundaries of creativity when we are faced with limitations and constraints!

The whale print fabric has been immensely popular. I had a piece tucked away in my ‘remnant box’ (it’s a physical box!) and resurrected it for masks but as of yesterday, had only  a small scrap just nice one side of a mask. This was my constraint. @adellywelly asked about the print as her daughter really liked the whales and I told her I couldn’t initially. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it! 🤗 I really wanted to make it happen and deliver on delight! So I consulted @bravenewworldssg about a half and half look, worried that it‘d look like a mistake and the reply was, “depends on the combination, always.”

Encouraged, I dug out two potential complimentary options and sent my preferred, the polka dot, over for a second opinion. Neither of us realised, till she saw the finished product, that the fabric swatches initially registered as pink and grey-green (swipe 👈) for her 😂😂😂 (Remember the blue/black vs white/gold dress divide?) For the record, I polled you guys and 130 of you saw pink/grey-green, and only 10 saw blue/white! How trippy!

Here’s the final mask. I’m really glad I got to make a little girl happy, use up small bits of fabric while doing so, and create a pretty lovely mask!

@bravenewworkds is not your typical art school; their philosophy is to impart critical thinking skills to kids through art. Check them out for nifty projects to work on with your kids during the rest of the #circuitbreakersg!
