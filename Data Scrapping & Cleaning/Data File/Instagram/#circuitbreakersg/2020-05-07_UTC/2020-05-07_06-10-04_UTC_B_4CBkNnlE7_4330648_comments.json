And the egg whites should have been beaten to stiff peaks with only white sugar. But my Mom was talking to me & I poured the brown sugar in with the egg whites and realised it was too late. Didn\u2019t want to throw out the whites so I just whisked it up anyway. It whisked up fine but wasn\u2019t as firm even after 10 minutes because of the density of the brown sugar. There was a bit of water seeping out after I set it aside for a while. But this didn\u2019t impact the end product \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f*",
