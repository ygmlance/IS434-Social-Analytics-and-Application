Over this period of down time at home, I’ve had a lot of time to really think about my purpose here on Instagram & what value I can bring to you. Of course, through this platform I want to share different wellness practices and tools of transformation with you. 🥑🏋🏻‍♀️ ⁣⁣

But moreover, I want to inspire you.🌟⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I want to empower you to follow a healthier way of living.🥦 ⁣⁣

I want to be your cheerleader when no one else in your life gets why you want to make a healthy change.🙌 ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
When you want to quit, I want to give you the tough love that lights a fire under your butt. 🔥⁣⁣⁣⁣

When you are in doubt of yourself, I want to be the voice that tells you, “No worries, you are enough. You’ve got this!”💖 ⁣

This is why I’m here.⁣⁣⁣⁣ 𑁍

I have been a health & wellness coach for two years, and it has been an absolutely amazing journey. I believe that we are all capable of living in a healthy body that we love and creating a lifestyle of freedom on our own terms.⁣⁣⁣⁣

And I’m here to show you how! ✨⁣⁣⁣⁣
