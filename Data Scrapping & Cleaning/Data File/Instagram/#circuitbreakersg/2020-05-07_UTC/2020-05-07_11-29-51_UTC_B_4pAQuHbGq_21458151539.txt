Blueberry Streusel Muffins for a friend's birthday! Prep Time: 15 min, Bake Time: 25 mins. But my prep time was delayed because the yogurt that I put aside was eaten by my husband. So, he went out to pick up some Greek yogurt! One error we made is that while waiting for the yogurt, we should have put the berries back into the freezer. It lost temperature and when folded in, blue streaks were formed and I think that affected the texture of the muffin (more moisture than expected). I will try this again. With the streusel top, I thought i'll reduce the sugar by 1/3 in the recipe, and I put abit more pink salt and cinnamon powder to balance the sugary flavour.
