Less smiley but flat out was me today

God knows my needs and the rest day was extremely timely despite ungrateful me grumbling last week about public holidays not nicely spaced out

Throbbing headache extending from temples to neck and shoulders or was it the other way around?
.
Cleared some headspace cooking pasta. Ciao for today
