Taro pie, from @burgerkingsg! 🍠
✨
This has always been my favourite taro pie since my primary school days. Glad that the taste didn’t change much, except that the filling got really little. I like how legit the yam tasted without being overly sweet, plus it wasn’t too cloying as well. Pretty decent for the price though I wish there’s more filling! ✌🏻
