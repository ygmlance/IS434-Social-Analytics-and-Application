31st day of the CB & Wesak Day ðŸª”
Itâ€™s a public holiday which means more kitchen experiments! ðŸ˜„

Breakfast | takeaway putu mayam & idly. So happy I found this and with PROPER brown sugar - none of that bright orange coloured rubbish.

Lunch | home-made curry mee using gluten-free spaghetti

Dinner | home-made minestrone with gluten free fusilli and home-made meatballs ðŸ˜‹
