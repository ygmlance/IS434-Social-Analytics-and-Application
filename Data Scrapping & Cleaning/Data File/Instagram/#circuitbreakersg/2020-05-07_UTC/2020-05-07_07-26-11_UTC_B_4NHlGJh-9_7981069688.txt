Yusef Lateef - Eastern Sounds, 1961. I’ve not had the opportunity to listen to Yusef Lateef much but this record is one that gets rotation simply because it’s inventive yet timeless. Yusef plays the tenor sax, flute, oboe, and a 5-note Chinese flute called the xun that leads the first track of the album. As it’s name implies #easternsounds fuses jazz with eastern influences, world music as we might call it today. But there’s still a lot of jazz in there, very good music. It’s also engineered by #rvg. I recommend this album if you haven’t heard it.  #yuseflateef #barryharris #erniefarrow #lexhumphries #moodsvillerecords
