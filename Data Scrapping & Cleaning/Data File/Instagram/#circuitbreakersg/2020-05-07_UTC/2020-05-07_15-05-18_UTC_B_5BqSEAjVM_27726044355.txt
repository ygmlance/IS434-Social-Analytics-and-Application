The Double Tree Cookie | The story behind this cookie. My first Double Tree experience was during my work trip to Christchurch. I had just completed a stock take in Auckland, met and interacted with many new faces throughout the day, then hopped onto my flight to Christchurch. I received a cookie upon check in. I didn't know their cookies were famous back then, but it was a sweet surprise after a long tiring day.

Double Tree revealed their cookie recipe recently and the baking world went crazy over it, so I knew I had to bake them too! Brings back memories of my crazy work adventures.
