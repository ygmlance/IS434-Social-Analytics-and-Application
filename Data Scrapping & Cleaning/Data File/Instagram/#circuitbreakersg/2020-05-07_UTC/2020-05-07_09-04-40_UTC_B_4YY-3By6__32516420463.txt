Missing the days prior lockdown where you could train outside and go to the gym (and where my Tan was on point) 😂

Trying to keep the motivation and spirit high. It can be quite difficult to keep the motivation up these days, but I made an agreement with myself, that I daily need to do something good for my body. Wether that is going for a long walk, eat a healthy salad, a 15 minut workout or an all in training - it all counts 💪🏻 Especially when I think a lot of us are opening the fridge a few times more than we normally would do 🙈😂 #fitfam#fitspo#fit#fitness#fitnessjourney#personaltrainer#crossfit#workout#nutrition#girlswithmuscle#healthylifestyle#health#abs#flex#gymlife#gymmotivation#circuitbreakersg#fitsg#instadaily#newbalance#cwmfitness
