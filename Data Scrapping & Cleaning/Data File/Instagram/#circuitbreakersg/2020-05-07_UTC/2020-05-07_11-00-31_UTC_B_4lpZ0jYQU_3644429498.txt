Day 31 of Circuit Breaker.⁣

Ｇｏｉｎｇ Ｂａｎａｎａｓ？ 🍌⁣
⁣
What happened when you double click your online purchases and ended up with 3 big bunches of bananas? 🍌 I almost go bananas after seeing them dropped on the table the next day. 🤣⁣
⁣
So I turned them all into banana bread and bless the family! 🍌⁣
⁣
I have shared the recipe many times. This is a fail-proof recipe and can be baked in any type of baking tin, mould or cupcakes liner.  All you need to do is adjust the ratio of the recipe and the baking time accordingly. ⁣
