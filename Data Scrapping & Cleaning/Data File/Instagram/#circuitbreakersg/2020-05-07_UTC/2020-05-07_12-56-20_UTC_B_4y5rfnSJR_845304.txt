In another reality where the world is a normal place, there won’t be a @buonavistatmc meeting today because of the Public Holiday (yea it is). Alas, here on Earth-1218, monthly meetings/gatherings go on as normal. Thanks to the pandemic.

But well these days, “normal” may be something to look forward to, and maybe even something to celebrate.

Happy Vesak Day.
