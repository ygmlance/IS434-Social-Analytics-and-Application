Hope everyone remembered to enjoy the public holiday today! 😜💐 Here’s one of our favourite styling combos that we did BC (before Corona!) with our friends @bennysgemscreations & @melissashoessg. We paired our happy striped jumpsuit with gorgeous semi-precious stones ring & earrings and topped them off with clear plastic sandals that Cinderella would definitely approve of if she was going for a date with Prince Charming after the CB gets lifted! Meanwhile, stay home, stay safe & keep healthy everyone! 🌈
