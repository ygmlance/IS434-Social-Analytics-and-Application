Clamp beehoon

What is the bear with rainy days? I would always go for something soupy

Ingredient: Korean flower clamp from @9seafood, Êñ∞Á´πbeehoon, white shimeji mushroom, spring onion, romaine lettuce, ginger, garlic, red chili, 2 eggs

1Ô∏è‚É£soak beehoon in water 30 minutes or boil in water for 5 minutes before cook
2Ô∏è‚É£prepare scrambled egg ahead
3Ô∏è‚É£mince garlic and red chili, cut 4-5 slices of ginger and 2-3 white part of spring onion
4Ô∏è‚É£heat up oil and fry garlic to slightly brownish. Add ginger until you started to smell aroma. Add in mince chili and fry for a while
5Ô∏è‚É£add clamps and about 10ml of shaoxing wine, white pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce and 2 tablespoon of soya sauce. fry for about 5 minutes with strong fire 
6Ô∏è‚É£add about 500ml of water and let the clamps continue to boil for 20minutes. Clamp soup will give the flavor here
7Ô∏è‚É£add in shimeji mushroom, soaked or cooked beehoon and continue to boil for 15 minutes. Turn to mid fire and continue to cook beehoon until soft, time depending on the texture of beehoon you like
üìùpersonally I like very soft beehoon so I cook it for about 20 minutes.
8Ô∏è‚É£add scrambled egg and romaine lettuce. Let
It cook for another 5 minutes. Add soya sauce to top up as you like
9Ô∏è‚É£add spring onion and it ready to serve
