Todayâ€™s lunch was lotus root soup, tomato egg, chicken chop and stir fried cabbage... been trying to learn more things during this stay home period but I am suddenly feeling abit down/aimless today...hopefully with everyone doing their part we will all be able to go out during June!! #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #lotusrootsoup #tomatoegg
