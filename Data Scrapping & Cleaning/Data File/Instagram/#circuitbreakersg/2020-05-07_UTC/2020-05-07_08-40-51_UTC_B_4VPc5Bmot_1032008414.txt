Stay busy but not be a busy body. 😂 Check out what Coach @hafiz.boxeo has got for you today!
🥊
Alright, so I’m back at the field today! Today, I’ll be briefly sharing three different ways to stay active when you’re not punching.

1️⃣ Defense
Parrying, slipping and catching are some of the defensive techniques you can use to either make your opponent miss or to feel your opponent’s power esp in the first few seconds of the round.

2️⃣ Footwork that can be used to evade or reset your opponent’s next move.

3️⃣ Feinting 
There are a few different ways of feinting from using the legs, hands and EYES! Yeap you read that right! 
Time to put these three moves into practice. Drop a comment below ⬇️ and let me know which one works best for you
👊🏼
