On the 32nd year of my existence here on planet earth, I wish for everyone to have good health and an abundance of happiness and blessings.

Special thanks to my wife for getting my favourite sea-salt caramel cake with gold flakes from @regentsingapore and for arranging a wholesome and tasty vegetarian lunch from @thegreensignature!

Special mention to all my friends who have pm-ed me and posted on my Facebook timeline your well-wishes. You guys are truly AA (awesome + amazing)! Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to wish everyone a Happy Vesak Day!

May we all overcome COVID-19 and emerge stronger together. Continue to stay safe and keep in touch! #circuitbreakerday31 #circuitbreakersg
