Dinner this evening was a Steamed Pork Patty that had salted turnip and was seasoned with Shaoxing wine and lard oil. It was topped with a swirl of superior light soya sauce and fried minced garlic before steaming. The vegetable dish was Stir-fried French Beans with Minced Pork and Pickled Olive Vegetable. These were accompanied with a bowl of steamed rice. Tasty and satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #steamedporkpatty #stirfriedfrenchbeanswithmincedpork #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #stayathome #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
