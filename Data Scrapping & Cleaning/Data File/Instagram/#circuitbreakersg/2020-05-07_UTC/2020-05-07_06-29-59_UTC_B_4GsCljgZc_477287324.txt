Vesak day, circuit breaker day how's everybody keeping? Flour, cream cheese, icing sugar are running out of stock at supermarkets. Changed baking menu - blue pea flower chiffon - think am quite pleased with this though didnt get a nice marble effect.  Soft, moist n fluffy chiffon the ideal chiffon for tea.
