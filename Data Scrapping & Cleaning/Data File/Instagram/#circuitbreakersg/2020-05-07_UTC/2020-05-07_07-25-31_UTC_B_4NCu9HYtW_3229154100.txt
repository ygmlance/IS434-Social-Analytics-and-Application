Dalgona aka Ppogi (Korean Candy). Just couldn’t stop nibbling this nutty, smoky, caramelized combed candy. 
Only need 3 ingredients needed - Sugar + Baking Soda + heat. 
Method:
1. Melt a lot of sugar (200g and more?) in a hot pan. Keep stirring. It will turn from sandy to rocky to thick melted smooth texture like malt sugar. (Ps: don’t let the sugar get burn else it will spoilt the whole taste). 2. Once the sugar is caramelized, get it off the heat, add in baking soda (1/2 to 1 spoonful). Keep stirring as it fluff up with lot of foam. This create the honeycombed like texture. (Ps: Please do not use your hand to touch the texture as the reaction of baking power and sugar create a very high temperature. You will get burnt!!) 3. Once it is done, transfer to cookie pan or anything non stick pan you like to shape in. Sprinkle some sugar before you Pour the mixture. 
4. Let it cool down.  You can put in a stick to make it like a lollipop or just like mine, leave as it is to hammer down after it is cooled down. 
5. Have fun exploring. *
