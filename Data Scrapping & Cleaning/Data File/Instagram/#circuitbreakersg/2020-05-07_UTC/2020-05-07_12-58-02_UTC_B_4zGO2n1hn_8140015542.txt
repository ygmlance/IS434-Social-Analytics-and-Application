Greasing the Groove ✨

I was recently introduced to #PavelTsatsouline (shoutout to @hareshtilani!) and the training method #GreasingTheGroove. The theory is that doing an exercise frequently (without going to muscular fatigue) improves neuromuscular efficiency and leads to strength 💪🏻 gains.

In short, strength is a skill and skills have to be practised. Similar to learning a language, if we only use it once a year we won’t retain it very well. However, if we are immersed in a foreign country and use the language frequently, we will learn it quicker.

Think five push-ups every hour or a couple pull-ups every time you walk through the door where you hung your pull-up bar. By the end of the day you would have done 20-30 pull-ups with minimal effort! .

With one more month of #CircuitBreakerSG to go, I’m committed to trying this out and seeing what results #GtG will yield! 😉
