How do you teach your kids mandarin?
.
We are very used to speaking English to Travis @myprincetravis. Although I try to speak to him in mandarin, it is just so hard to switch. He can understand mandarin when we speak to him but doesn't like to use it so much. Since these days he is at home, it is a good opportunity to try to improve his mandarin.
.
Featuring the "Write Play Love Vol.1" by HHGZ. It is a sticker book that helps teach young children basic Chinese words. The book uses 3 ways to teach:
1. Pasting rainbow colour stickers over the strokes
2. Using their fingers to trace the strokes 
3. Using QR code to scan for further video materials
Travis love rainbow 🌈 this book easily attract his attention! He enjoys playing with the stickers. I also repeatedly emphasize hand is 手 and explained the strokes to him. I like educational material that is fun to learn. It makes learning more enjoyable and easier to pick things up.
