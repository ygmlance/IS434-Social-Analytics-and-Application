We know that white blood cells are an important component of our immune system, but what else are there in our bloodstream?

Learn more about the components of our blood through modelling it.

You will need:
1) A tray
2) Red play dough (You may refer to our DIY play dough recipe)
3) DIY germs (can be made using dough and cotton buds) 
4) White ping-pong balls

The tray will represent our blood vessels which contains the "red blood cells" and the "white blood cells". Step 1: Make the red blood cells using the red play dough. The red blood cells are circular in shape, and are smaller than the white blood cells (to be more precise, teach your kid that the play dough should have a dent in it, to represent the biconcave shape of red blood cells). You can also explain that the red blood cells transport oxygen around our body. 
Step 2: Throw in the ping-pong balls which represents the white blood cells. Note that there should be lesser of ping-pong balls than the "red blood cells". Step 3: Add the germs into the game, and let your kid have fun "destroying" the germs with the white blood cells.

To hone your kid's observation skills, you can try to let him/her observe the different properties of red blood cells and white blood cells through the model, instead of telling them explicitly. Scroll to the last image to see a quick comparison of the two types of cells.

Quick note: the book used in the photos is "The Magic School Bus: Inside the Human Body", by Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen. We recommend reading the book to older kids as it may be too wordy for the younger ones. However, the illustrations in this book is a great tool for science learning!
