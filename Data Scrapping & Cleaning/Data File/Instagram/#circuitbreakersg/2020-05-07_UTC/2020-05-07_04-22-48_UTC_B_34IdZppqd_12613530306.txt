Darn! It's been a week, and that's a farking huge gap! 👎⠀

It's all because I was soaked in work 👷‍♂️ 👷‍♂️ 👷‍♂️⠀
⠀
I tend to work more for working from home, weekdays, weekends, Labour day made no difference. A laptop, a desk, a chair and an optional pair of boxers were all it took to get productive.⠀
⠀
Please boss, if you're reading this, I need a room in the office already -- I can stick "Do Not Disturb" on the door myself. Thank you! 😏😏👍⠀
