| CB ~ Day 31 | 
Hot weather eats with an array of Japanese #plantbased dishes for a Vesak Day Lunch (ðŸ¥š not incld).
.
We enjoy Japanese O-kazu as much as we love Chinese and Korean appetisers, especially when they are served chilled. These are some of our fave Meidi-ya Deli picks to accompany the cold Cha Soba which I prepared.
.
Side dishes:.
â€¢ Horensou No Goma-ae (fresh, blanched spinach tossed in sesame dressing).
â€¢ Kinpara Gobo (braised carrot and burdock root in soy sauce).
â€¢ Hijiki Seaweed and Lotus Root salad.
â€¢ Tamagoyki (rolled egg omelette) and.
â€¢ Takuan Daikon (white).
.
For the chilled Green Tea Soba, I made our own Men Tsuyu noodle dipping sauce with #homemade dashi, light soya sauce, mirin, sugar and wasabi. 
Then finished with a drizzle of chopped spring onion and toasted sesame. Seaweed flakes (not pictured).
.
The perfect meal for spending a public holiday in amidst mercury rising ðŸŒž.
