Been seeing many #homemade version of this popular #streetsnack on my FB feed recently, I knew I’ve to try it one day! So, today is the day since I’ve all the ingredients at home!😝⁣

Like all recipes (if I ever use them), I improvise and tweak to my liking. Topped my crispy, buttery banana roti with a generous drizzle of peanut butter, condensed milk and a sprinkle of Milo powder. Sinfully yummy! #aroimakmak😋⁣
