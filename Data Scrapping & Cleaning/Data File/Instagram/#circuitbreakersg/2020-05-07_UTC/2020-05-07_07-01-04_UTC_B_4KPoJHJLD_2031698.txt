Day 30 circuit breaker thoughts:

If I don't like something just take away its power:
my attention.

Also, if cauliflower can be pizza and kale can be chips, I can do anything I set my mind to.

From this moment forward, I invite unlimited abundance into my life in garuda sirsasana( Eagle headstand pose). Garuda- A creature with eagle and human feature represent birth and heaven.
