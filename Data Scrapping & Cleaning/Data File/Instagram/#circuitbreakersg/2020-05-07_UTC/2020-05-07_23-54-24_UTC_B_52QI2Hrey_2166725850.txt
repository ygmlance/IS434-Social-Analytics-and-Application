Han Liguang (@han_lg) of Michelin-starred Labyrinth (@restaurantlabyrinth)— also part of the the World’s 50 Best Restaurants Discovery series— is pushing boundaries by creating progressive Singaporean cuisine that remains faithful to the country’s heritage and flavors—his “New Expression of Singaporean Cuisine.” The former banker sources 70-80% of his produce locally, and if you’ll notice, there’s no beef in his tasting menu as there are no cows in Singapore!
