CHLORINE in WATER.
Chlorine is used to keep our water clean by disinfecting it and killing germs. It does a marvelous job at eliminating most pathogens from the water we drink. However, the use of this poweful chemical has its downside.
The potentially dangerous effects of chlorine and the use of the chemical has been linked to a wide range of ailments, including various cancers, reproductive problems, problems with the immune system, and heart attacks.
