For Beginner like me 
Recipe is very simple
5 small eggs or 3 big eggs (separate white and yolk) 
3 table spoon flours 
One table spoon honey 
3 table spoon sugar 
3 table Fresh milk 
Mix egg yolk with honey and fresh milk first. Add Abit of oil. Seive the flour into the bowl. Mix well. 
Prepare another bowl - beat egg white and sugar, gradually add in the sugar. Whisk untill fluffy. The egg white remain in the bowl even if you turn it upside down. 😁

Fold the white into the yolk
Bake 175 degree for 35 mins. 
Do not open halfway to check, it will deflate 😂
