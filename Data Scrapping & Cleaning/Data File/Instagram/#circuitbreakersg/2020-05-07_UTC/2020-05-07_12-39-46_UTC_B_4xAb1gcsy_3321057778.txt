Things to do with the kids #48

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Not bad this circle seat, birds eye view of the co-runner virus crowd." "You see, Titus, Mum has good ideas sometimes." "Vanilla, I don't think this was Mum's idea. I realised that I had a better view from upstairs." "Titus, she carried you upstairs so she could close up downstairs. She had to sit down afterwards." "She's just unfit." "No she's not. She runs, you merely waddle." "Vanilla, I am not a goose. Once again, you've found a way of mocking my #workingfromhome food issues. And this photo makes me look so silth-like." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
