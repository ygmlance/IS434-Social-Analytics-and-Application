Here is a little Covid19 update from Singapore. All adjusting quite well and I feel many are getting used to the new normal. 
Rules are strict (as they should be), but what bothers me is the amount of people reporting others for, for instance, not wearing a mask (and they are 200 meters away from them). It feels like a culture of “let me teach you a lesson”, which is petty to say the least.
