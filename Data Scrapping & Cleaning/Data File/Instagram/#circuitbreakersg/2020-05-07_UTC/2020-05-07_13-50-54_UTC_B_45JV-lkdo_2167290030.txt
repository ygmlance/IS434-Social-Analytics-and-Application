DAY 31 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
MEDITERRANEAN BUDDHA BOWL
🥗🥗🥗🥗🥗🥗 Hello Instafam! 
Wishing you all a very HAPPY VESAK DAY! 
Considering that the longer months have 31 days, we have succesfully completed a month of the circuit breaker today. And it happens to be the auspicious day of Buddha Jayanti too.

It just felt right to do a Buddha Bowl today. So did a vegetarian, satvik one for myself, and a not-so-buddha-bowl for my son, with chicken in it 😉 
After my laziness bout this afternoon, and feeding him instant noodles, it was only fair that I cooked him a good meal at night.
I really wish I had bulgur because that would have been perfect. But I didnt, so made quinoa instead, flavoured with with Za'tar. Made the chicken in Sumaq spice. 
The bowl has ...
🔹️ Falafel
🔹️ Hummus
🔹️ Quinoa
🔹️ Baba Ganoush
🔹️ Avocado & carrot
🔹️ Chicken .
