Whatâ€™s a dish that can be eaten both meals? Well, Itâ€™s arguably the ubiquitous and well-loved steamed chicken rice. Everything home-cooked including the achar (pickled cucumbers n carrots), threw in more pineapples for good measure - simply love more piquant n tanginess to my achar. Did the whole chicken rempah with garlic, shallots and lotsa ginger n cooked some chicken stock. Mix all in and voila! A lip-smacking dish of chicken rice thatâ€™s infused with the aromas of those rempah. The marinated chicken is fabulous if I may say so. Made some winter melon soup to complement the chicken rice. Yums! ðŸ¥°#throwback to a few weeks ago when I made a batch of matcha marble cake to  be sent to my folks. .

Also, Iâ€™ll not be cooking nor baking for a while Cos I hurt myself in a little nasty accident in the kitchen earlier ðŸ˜­ my finger  is wrapped in gauze now. Just cos I was rushing to finish some reports so I can catch the last bit of â€˜Never have I everâ€™ on Netflix. Itâ€™s incredibly honest and hilarious - love it! Go catch it if you havenâ€™t already. Later guys! Continue to keep safe. ðŸ˜˜
