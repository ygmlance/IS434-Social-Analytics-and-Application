[06.05.20] Seems like everyone is being a Baker at home, the surge of breadmaker sale shot up, bread flour n yeast went OOS. But still, it's time for Matcha Almond Loaf! Used Mayer breadmaker and chose the soft bread function. It's really soft! #igsg #foodstagram #matcha #almond #loaf #mayerbreadmaker #circuitbreakersg #lockdown2020 #ingredientsmatter #yishun #stayhomewithascott
