Real happiness is CHEAP and costs nothing at all! .

In this post, I would like to show you some crafts and DIY toy projects I have been doing with my kids during circuit breaker period. The only thing I need is a tube of glue! I didn‚Äôt even stock anything from the book store before it was closed for circuit breaker measures! Kids get contented so easily and it doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of materials I used to make those toys, as long as it‚Äôs workable, it‚Äôs exciting and fun enough, all are good for kids! Trust me!

We made a dinosaur vending machine from Meiji Biscuit Box, some unused jewellery boxes, a bottle cap (as vending machine button), unused plastic wrapper (as see through display). We also made a claw machine and an ATM machine using the similar things except we used unused key ring as the DIY claw ü§£ Other things my kids enjoyed making are cold fake snow made of corn flour and baby lotion, refrigerate it to make it cold like real snow & building a ‚õÑÔ∏è, a blast-off-straw rocket üöÄ. They also enjoyed games like paper soccer using shoe box lid, origami paper jumping frogs with obstacle course challenge and catching goldfish game (goldfish made of unused plastic bag and orange colour food colouring). For Calysta, we made Elsa/Frozen bracelet, the pendant is made of coloured eggshells and layered with non toxic glitter nail polish. Calysta said that beautiful pendant contains Elsa power and she loves it ü§£ we made many more stuff too! if you guys are keen with my DIY, craft works and toy projects that cost nothing at all, do check out my IG story highlights: ‚ÄúToyProjects, FunLearning and DIY‚Äù on how to make them! I update almost daily during this stay home period! ‚ù§Ô∏è
