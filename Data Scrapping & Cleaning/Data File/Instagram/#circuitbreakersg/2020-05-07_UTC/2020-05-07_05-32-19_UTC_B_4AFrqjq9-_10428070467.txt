â˜†Happy Vesak Dayâ˜†
Here's wishing everyone of you a Happy Vesak Day!

Sharing my collection of Ayaka from the official lotus design under the Meister Course of Flower of Crystal Art Academy.

It is also one of my favourite design to paint and maybe because the kanji sounds like my name?

In Kanji, Ayaka is å½©èŠ±

My name is é‡‡æ…§

Kind of similar, eh? Used to think my name is abit tacky but it also sounds the same as å½©ç»˜ - look what I'm doing now, exactly what my name sounds ðŸ¤£. Kind of interesting to connect all these dots together, right?

Take a good breather today, hang in there, think of all the things we can be grateful for.

I pray for the health of everyone and all creatures living on Mother Earth. May we all stand united and continue to practice compassion in this situation. â€¢
