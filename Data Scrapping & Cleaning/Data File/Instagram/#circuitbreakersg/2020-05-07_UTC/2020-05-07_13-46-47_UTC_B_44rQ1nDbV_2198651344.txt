[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Since @tuoi18 shared her curry chicken, I will share my @AyamBrandSG rendang chicken paired with @MissionFoods.SG's naan. I have to admit that I "cheated" with ready-made sauces and food, but am grateful for these because they really help to save meal prep time. üëç
.
I glammed up my plain naan with some freshly-chopped garlic and olive oil, and topped it up with lots of mixed herbs. Love it! Swipe ‚¨ÖÔ∏è for more pics. Head to my "Mission Foods" IG Highlights for more pics/ videos.
