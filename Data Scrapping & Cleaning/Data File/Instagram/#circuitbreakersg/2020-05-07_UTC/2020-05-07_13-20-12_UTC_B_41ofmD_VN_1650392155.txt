New routine this week (with no home based learning), so I am still figuring how to work effectively at home while keeping E occupied. It is good I have my planner to keep me on the straight and narrow ~ I rely on it now more than ever because the inevitable interruptions mean I need a reliable list to remind me just where I am in terms of tasks. Are you using your planner more or less during this time?
