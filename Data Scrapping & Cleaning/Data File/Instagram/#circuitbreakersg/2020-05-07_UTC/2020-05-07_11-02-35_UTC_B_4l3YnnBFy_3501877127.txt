Thursday 7 May 2020, 6:45 pm: Full Moon in Scorpio. This is an excellent lunation for spiritual activities - small wonder that it's also Vesak Day.

I've just concluded a ritual that officially establishes my altar (and new home office) as a sacred space, dedicated to Guan Yin, Goddess of Mercy. 💗

This place had been dedicated to Her from the start, but the ritual takes everything to a different level of Her energy, presence, and power. 🔥

It's intense. I'm still a little light-headed from the energy shift. Meanwhile, my cat Pip watches quietly. 🌟

Happy Vesak Day, darlings!! 😄🙏❤🌟
