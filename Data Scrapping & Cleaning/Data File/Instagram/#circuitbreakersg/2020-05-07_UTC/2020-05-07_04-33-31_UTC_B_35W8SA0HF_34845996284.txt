Avocado mushroom toast

I love avocado and like to make it into variation for breakfast toast. Hereâ€™s the variation with brown button mushroom. ðŸ”¸avocado: take overripe avocado smashed with cow cheese and mix evenly. You can add minced tomatoes or lemon juice to make it refreshing.
ðŸ”¸mushroom: slice brown button mushroom and stir fry with butter until dry. Add pinch of salt, pepper and herbs for flavor
ðŸ¥ªassemble on bread with mozzarella cheese as topping. Toast it for a while and ready to serve with scramble egg.
