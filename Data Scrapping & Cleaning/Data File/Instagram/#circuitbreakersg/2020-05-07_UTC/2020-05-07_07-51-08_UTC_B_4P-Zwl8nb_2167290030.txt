DAY 31 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
😂😂😂
MAMEE NOODLES WITH THAI CHICKEN 😂😂😂 This was my "Sorry-I-Am-Not-In-The-Mood-to-Cook"  lunch today. 
Made Mamee with vegetables. 
Made chicken with lemongrass, kaffir lime leaf, chilli, thai ginger, ginger, and a tom yum soup cube (in the pic)
Thats it. No mood to today 🤷‍♀️
The only effort was to put it on a plate and dress it up for a picture 😂😂😂 .
