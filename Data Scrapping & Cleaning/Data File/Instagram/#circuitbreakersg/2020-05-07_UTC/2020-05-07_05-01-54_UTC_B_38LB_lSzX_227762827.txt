Lemon essential oil has been found to contain a natural component called “d-limonene” which helps to calm inflammation, kill germs, support immunity and clear congestion. Therefore to use it in the kitchen is a great idea in the following ways:
1/ diffuse the aroma in your diffuser 
2/ clean your kitchen sponge
3/ clean your cutting board
Take note that lemon essential oil may lighten the color of some wooden or bamboo cutting board and may also lighten stains on the board.... something to keep in mind. 
If you have other ways to use this oil, please share in the comment below. Cheers! 👏
