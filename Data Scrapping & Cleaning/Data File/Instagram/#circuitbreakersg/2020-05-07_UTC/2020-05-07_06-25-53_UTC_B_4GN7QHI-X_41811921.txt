One of the highlights of the Circuit Breaker period for me is this initiative by @ysa.sg ❤️ All EXCO members can be nominated by individuals to read and video record a story from @ysa.sg publication, Singapore at 50 - 50 Sikhs and their Contributions. At the end of the story they will also share lessons they personally took away from reading these stories. All we request is that you make a contribution to ongoing relief efforts to support those affected by COVID-19 🙏🙏 I’ve personally had the privilege to read two stories so far, and it’s been a wonderful experience to go down memory lane and as a way of also developing empathy for others. No doubt these Singaporean Sikhs have made significant achievements in their lives. Their stories reveal however that it was not without facing their fair share of challenges and adversities, and more importantly having the resolve to overcome come them. This is also important given the current period and this global pandemic we are facing. And during this time, I am grateful that @ysa.sg has this publication of stories which give us all much needed hope and inspiration 😃❤️ On a less serious note, finally all those lessons and exams in Oral Presentation came to good use!!! 😂😂😂 I wish you all enjoy these stories as much as I did reading them 😃🙏 You can watch YSA EXCO members read these stories on our facebook page, and we’re also working on putting these up on youtube soon! 😃👍
