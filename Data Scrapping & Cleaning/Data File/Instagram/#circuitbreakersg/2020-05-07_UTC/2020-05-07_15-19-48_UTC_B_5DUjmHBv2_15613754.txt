Whiting Stuff Taro deep fried - Sarah Tiong's dish from the Asian Mystery box (MasterChef Au S12) Oh my, I certainly used more than the time needed in a mystery box challenge. Mashing the taro was one hell of a bicep exercise. When I was down to the wire, I wasn't even thinking. I thought taro looks uncooked from from the deep fryer when I had steamed before hand. #circuitbreakersg day24 #ibonappetit #mylollybellykitchen #isolationcooking #quarantineandcook #isocooking #isolife #lockdowncooking #MasterChefAu #sarahtiongrecipe
