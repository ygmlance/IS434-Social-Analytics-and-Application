With MacD out of operation for the time being, and English muffins not on the shelves, I was inspired to try and make my own. That is, after seeing others' attempt, otherwise known as "monkey see monkey do". ðŸ™ˆðŸ™Š Having no mixer, I tried a no knead recipe. I find that the ones shaped round by hand into a ball then rolled out came out nicer. And it is very important they not stick to the pan on which they are doing the final proof else there will be heart pain when transferring to the frying pan (kiss goodbye to smooth surface). Oh yes, don't roll the dough out too thin before cutting if that is the technique you are using. About 2cm thickness works much better. 
I am really happy with how these turned out.

Swipe left ðŸ‘ˆ to see how craggy they are.
