So.. Iâ€™ve been working on this new little project and thought of penning it down as a post. Though it's still a prototype and still quite raw, Iâ€™m already loving it a lot. ðŸ˜‚Wanna make a guess what these are?

Dropping some clues: 
1. These cute little blocks act as a support to the main structure
2. It is related to our wearables/pieces of jewellery 
3. It is customisable
