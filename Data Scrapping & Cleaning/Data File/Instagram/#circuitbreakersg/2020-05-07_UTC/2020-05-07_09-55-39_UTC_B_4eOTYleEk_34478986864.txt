Home style Russo-Hainanese cuisine from @shashliksg in Orchard. Shown here are the Beef Stroganoff (served with chicken rice), Chicken a la Kiev, and traditional fish and chips. Their French onion soup (not shown) was delightful. Order via whatsapp â€” number is on their website. Food was delivered ahead of schedule.
