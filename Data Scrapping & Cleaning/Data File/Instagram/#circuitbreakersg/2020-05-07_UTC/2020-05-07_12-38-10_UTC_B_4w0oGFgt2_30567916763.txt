Had homemade ban mian 板面 🍜 for dinner because noodle-making is so fun and I wanted to try making a different type of noodles apart from pasta. 😃

Soup stock was made using pork bones, chicken bones, soya beans and ikan bilis, which were simmering in the slow cooker since last night. .

Given the amount of preparation that went behind making what looks like a simple dish, it may seem to make more sense simply buying this from the coffee shop. However, the satisfaction that I got from making this dish (and many other dishes) from scratch, is immense. ☺️

Which is why, I will continue to cook, whenever I can. 🙂 And I’m grateful that I am able to. #gratitudediary
