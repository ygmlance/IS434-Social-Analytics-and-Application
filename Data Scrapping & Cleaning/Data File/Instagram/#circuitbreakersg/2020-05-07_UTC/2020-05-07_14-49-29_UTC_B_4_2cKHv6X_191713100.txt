♥️: Baguettes 🥖

How do I spend my public holiday? Definitely baking my time away😂

Made mini baguette without mold.. my baguettes are definitely in their freestyle, wild and free shapes🤣

Gonna keep these two previous for Bánh Mì !!! Vietnam is calling.... anyone is in for a bowl of pho ga with bánh mì? 🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻🙋🏻‍♀️
