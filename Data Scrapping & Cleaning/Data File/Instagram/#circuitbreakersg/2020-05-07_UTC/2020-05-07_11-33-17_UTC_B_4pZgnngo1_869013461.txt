This a good time to spring clean my room and drawer. Threw out a lot of half used, expired make up and rusty accessories. 😔 Never. Buying. On. Impulse. Ever. Again.  What's left I re-arrange them in organisers with clear, see through panels to make choices easier. 👍
Looking forward to the time I'll be using them again. ❤️
