I was slicing shallots when the door bell rang! When I saw the grab food rider, I knew someone has sent a #cbsurprise food delivery and most likely it’s my baby bro as this is not the first time he has done it. Yeah true enough it’s him - tahu telur and 2 Ayam penyet (green chilli & red chilli). As I’ve avocado, I make alpukat! So yeah, our Indonesian meal is complete.

Btw, my parents also has been receiving random #grabfood #circuitbreakersurprise from me and baby bro. Since we can’t iftar with them, sending our love & care through food is in a way, the way we connect with them and telling them “Hey mama ayah, don’t be sad ya, though we are not there with you this ramadhan, we still remember you.” ❤️🤗
