#circuitbreakersg [Recipe] I lost track of the day count! We've been doing so much HBL, zoom and cooking so I decided it was time to make a sweet treat. -
We haven't had this in awhile coz there are no pasar malam going on now. Muah Chee is so easy to make and it's done within 30min (compared to those brown sugar boba everyone is making now :p)

Muah Chee
------------------
125g glutinous rice flour
170ml milk 
1 tbsp shallot oil *optional
a plate full of ground peanuts 
1. Mix g.rice flour and milk with a whisk until the mixture is smooth. If you don't have milk, use water. I prefer using milk for better taste and gooey texture.
2. Add shallot oil or olive oil and mix.
3. Pour into a dish that has been oiled.
4. Steam for 10-12mins until it's set to your liking.
5. Scoop up a blob of it and drop it into another plate with the ground peanuts.
6. Use 2 spoons to chop up the blob in bite sizes and toss it in ground peanuts.
7. Enjoy it fresh! ‚úåüèº -

All these ingredients can be easily found in the supermarket. G rice flour and ground peanuts will be in the baking items section while shallot oil will be in the cooking oil section. Alternatively, you can also save the excess oil from frying onions for "bawang goreng" at home.
