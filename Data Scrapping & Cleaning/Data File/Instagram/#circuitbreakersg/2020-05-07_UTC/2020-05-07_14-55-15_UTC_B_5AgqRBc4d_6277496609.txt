Carrot cake with chantilly cream ðŸ˜˜ Was thinking of making cream cheese frosting and caramel sauce but no time. This is another simple carrot cake recipe that you can make using the humble rice cooker. The cooking time is a little long but the steam from the rice cooker helps to make the cake moist, trust me. .
2 cups cake flour 
1 tsp baking soda 
Pinch of salt .
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cups veggie oil 
1 small bottle vitagen
.
Mix the wet ingredients together then add 3 eggs (1 at a time) and mix until well incorporated then add 2 tsp vanilla essence and mix until incorporated .
Then pour the wet mixture (sugar, oil, vitagen, eggs, vanilla essence) into the dry ingredients bowl (flour, baking soda, salt) a little at a time and mix slowly. Donâ€™t overmix. .
After that add your shredded carrots (about 3 large carrots) and a cup of chopped walnuts. Then mix well. .
Oil bowl of rice cooker. Pour batter in and cook. You might have to run the cook cycle 3-4 times until the skewer test comes out clean .
.
For chantilly cream: whisk 3 cups of whipping cream with 3 tbsp sugar (pour 1 tbsp at a time). After you get soft peaks add 2/3 tbsp vanilla essence and whisk until firm peaks (Tip: i find it better to put your mixing bowl and whisk in the freezer for about 10mins before whipping the cream)
