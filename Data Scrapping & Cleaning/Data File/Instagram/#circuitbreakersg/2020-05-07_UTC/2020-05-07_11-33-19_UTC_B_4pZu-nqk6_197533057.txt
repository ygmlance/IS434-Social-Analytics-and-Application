Are you missing restaurant style #tikkamasala during lockdown? Honestly it’s rather easy to make the gravy at home and you can add your choice of veggies, paneer, egg or even meat(although I have 0 experience cooking any meat). Here goes the recipe and tag me if you try this #vegetrailian

What you need:
👉🏼2 large tomatoes 🍅 freshly puréed
👉🏼1 onion 🧅 chopped and ground to a paste
👉🏼1 tbsp ginger garlic paste / grated
👉🏼1 tbsp tomato paste(for the deep red color)
👉🏼15-20 cashews (soaked in warm water)
👉🏼 1 tsp turmeric powder
👉🏼1 tsp cumin seeds
👉🏼1 tsp garam masala
👉🏼1 tsp chopped chilies(optional)
👉🏼 Boiled eggs 🥚 for egg tikka masala OR pan fried paneer for paneer tikka masala
👉🏼Oil , Butter & Salt to taste

How to whip it up:
✅ In a heavy bottom pan, heat some oil and once it’s hot enough add cumin and green chilies and let them splutter.
✅Next add the ginger garlic and onion paste and cook till the oil leaves the sides of the paste. ✅Add thé dry garam masala, turmeric and continue to stir. ✅Make a relatively fine paste with the soaked cashews with little water and add to the pan which should now be aromatic
✅Lastly add the puréed tomatoes and cover and cook for about 10-15 minutes till the tomatoes thicken and reduce. ✅Finally add the tomato paste, salt and either the boiled eggs or the paneer and continue to cook for 5 minutes
✅Top with a slice of butter 🧈 and serve hot garnished with coriander and naan or fluffy rice 🍚 on the side
