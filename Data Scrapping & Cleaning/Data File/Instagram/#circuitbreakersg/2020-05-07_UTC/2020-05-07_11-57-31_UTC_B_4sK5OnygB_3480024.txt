Cir Breaker Day 31 Dinner.
We are having an advance mini celebration at home tonight, so first 2 meals of the day were light and boring. 
Dinner was takeout from Ban Leong Wah Hoe Seafood Restaurant. We had chilli crab with fried mantous, har jeong gai, signature fried mee sua and fuyu (fermented beancurd) kang kong.  We spread all the food out on newspaper since we knew that it was gonna get messy.
The crab was about a kg, and the meat was super succulent and bouncy. The chilli sauce was good, thick enough, sufficiently sweet and spicy, just wished that they had added more garlic (personal preference) to raise the oomph level. It was yummy to mop up the sauce with the fried mantous, which were still crispy almost an hour out of the kitchen. The deep fried prawn paste chicken aka har jeong gai were nice but not the best I had. Anyway, I am no super fan of this dish.
The fuyu kang kong was good, just a prerequisite vegetable dish to order when we have zichar. The final dish, the signature fried mee sua, was fabulous. I could have this alone for a meal and be truly satisfied. The seafood variety was so generous and fresh too, and the mee sua very well fried. We only touched a small portion of it, thus the rest would be saved for lunch tomorrow.
Now, need to rest after this feast, then it's to the park to work off some of the calories from this meal
