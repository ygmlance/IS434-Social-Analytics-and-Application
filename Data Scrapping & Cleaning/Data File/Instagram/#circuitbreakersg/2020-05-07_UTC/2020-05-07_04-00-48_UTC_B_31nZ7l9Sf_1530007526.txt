🥕🍰🥕Ⓦ︎Ⓗ︎Ⓘ︎Ⓣ︎Ⓔ︎ 🅒︎🅐︎🅡︎🅡︎🅞︎🅣︎ 🅒︎🅐︎🅚︎🅔︎ for today's breakfast, Day 31 CB, a la Chey Sua style. Finally done with that slab of radish cake I got a few days back since it's the 3rd time I'm eating it this week. 🤣

So I've been watching how the hawker auntie from this famous carrot cake stall makes her version and decided to try it out. It's pretty much the same for the black version I made earlier at the front, except for the step after you pan fry the carrot cake cubes. Add them into 2 beaten eggs, add a bit more oil into your non-stick pan, then add the egg and carrot cake mixture back to the pan to form a pancake.

Allow the omelette to cook for a few minutes until it starts to crisp up at the sides. Divide into 4 and flip over the pieces to cook the other side. When it's done, add a layer of sambal chilli jam on the top and garnish.

Verdict: It's not Michelin standard yet, but pretty satisfying! 😁
