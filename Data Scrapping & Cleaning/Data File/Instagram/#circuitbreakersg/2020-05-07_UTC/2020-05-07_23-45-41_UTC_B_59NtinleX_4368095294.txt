🐔CB Day32 - Breakfast🍚
.
My favourite brand is back❤️so addicted to this Khong Guan Chicken Glutinous Rice.
.
Last week the SMH one, not to my liking... However, I really enjoy glutinous rice that's from the Cantonese style dim sum restaurant. Those are freshly made. If the frozen kind, anytime I will still choose Khong Guan. 😊🤤😊🤤😊🤤
