Homemade Lor Mee with braised pork belly, pan-fried Kambong fish (deboned) and Lor Bak (Ngoh Hiang) from Kheng Pin in Penang which was buried all the way in the farthest corner of the freezer and I found it! 😆👏🏻 I also mixed in some Sambal Belachan which added a layer of piquant flavour to the Lor Mee. Yumz! 😍😋
