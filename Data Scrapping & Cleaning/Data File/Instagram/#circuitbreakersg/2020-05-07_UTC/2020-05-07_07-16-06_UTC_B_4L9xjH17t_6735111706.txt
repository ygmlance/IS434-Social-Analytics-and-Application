SINGAPORE ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ â€” Want to support your favourite local bars during Circuit Breaker? You can! Tune in to 1887 Virtual Barâ€™s weekly guest shifts on Zoom where you get to watch bartenders in action and the opportunity to purchase drink vouchers.

The digital bar was created to support Singaporeâ€™s cocktail establishments during this trying period and viewers can order signature drinks in advance (they can be redeemed at the bars after Circuit Breaker) at $20 per cocktail.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
William Grant & Sons will match the value of your support dollar to dollar, which means your local bar would receive double the amount youâ€™ve spent! Guest shift are held online every Thursday night until 4 June 2020.

Thank you @1887VirtualBar for sending the lovely box of cocktail ingredients over to us & see you guys online later!
