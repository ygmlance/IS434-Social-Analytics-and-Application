#quarantips While parents are missing travels, dining, shopping at malls and almost everything that due to the #circuitbreakersg we can't do, JUST LOOK at our LITTLE ONES!!! 💛
.
Seriously there's so much to LEARN from kids and I simply have immense respect for how they have taken the whole situation so gracefully in their stride and making the most of it. .
⚙️ Their little world has changed so much with schools closed, no meeting friends and no outdoor play. .
⚙️ They have to hear all the news invariably about Covid-19, how many cases in Singapore, how many in the world, how people are dying, how it's spreading, how there's no vaccine yet and so on. .
⚙️ Suddenly, they are bombarded with new terms like Coronavirus, lockdown, social distancing etc. They not only have to understand these but have to abide by them too. .
⚙️ HBL, SLS is their new school life and they have to adjust so much to this new routine.
.
⚙️ Parents are at home 24x7 and kids have to bear with them 😆🤭

Kids are going through major transformation thanks to #covid19 and they are showing amazing level of maturity, resilience and positivity 💛 In fact, they are silently motivating their parents to make the most of the #circuitbreakersg 🙏🏻😘

Kids are such cute heroes isn't it?
