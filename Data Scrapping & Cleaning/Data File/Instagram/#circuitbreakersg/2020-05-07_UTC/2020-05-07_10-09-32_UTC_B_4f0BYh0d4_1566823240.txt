To me, the most difficult part about chasing one's dream is not failure... It is also not about productivity... It is about doubting myself and the fear of doing everything alone...
.
.For years, I've been wanting to do something I love not because of money or profit. But I always end up giving up and going back to the workforce. I've always wanted to have a "partner" to work along with me just so that I don't have to shoulder everything on my own...even if my partner doesn't have to create anything, I can do the job...as long as I have a companion in a small biz...
.
.But so many years have passed... Things remained unchanged... It is not until when I've become a mother of two myself, and almost lost my life during the second birth, that I've known and seen what my own resilience can do...
.
.And due to personal reasons at home, I became  depressed sometimes and have felt so lonely despite being surrounded by people that loves me... But, this is not a post about giving up and giving in... It is about a realization on something I have held onto for so long- to depend and rely on others in times of stress & doubt...
.
.Truly, "you don't know how strong you are, until being strong is the only option you have"
.
.This post is to salute all MOTHERS, for the times you held on because of your kids, for the courage you had to force it out of yourself because you want to protect your kids...And most importantly, for the loneliness you have felt so many times because you're the only one who understands your kids but they can never understand you...
.
.So, it's okay to feel lonely sometimes, coz you may need to walk alone just to see a beauty that someone else can't. (P.s Thank you mummy, @anthea6396 ‚ô•Ô∏è )
.
