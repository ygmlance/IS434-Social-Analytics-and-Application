“Don’t compare yourself to others”
-
Easy as it sounds, I think it’s one of the most difficult things in life to achieve. We’re only humans, and sometimes we just can’t help but to compare ourselves to others — often leaving our own feelings empty and depressed.

Over the years, I’m glad that I’ve finally learned to let go of these unhealthy emotions that are hindering myself from growing, and to experience the world in my own unique ways. I wish the same for everyone out there. 
Be fun, be weird, be you ❤️💛💚💙💜
