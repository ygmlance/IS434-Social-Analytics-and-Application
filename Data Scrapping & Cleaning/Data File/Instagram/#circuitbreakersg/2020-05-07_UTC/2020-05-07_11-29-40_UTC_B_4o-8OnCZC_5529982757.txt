We were all in the mood for some value-for-money absolutely delicious #mentaiko #salmon so we reordered from @salmonsamurai again! As always we were gaga over the creamy mentaiko sauce. We always order the family favourite Salmon Mentaiko with Udon or Soba ($9.90) 
I had the Mentai Samurai which included the same mentaiko salmon but with a mix of both white rice and brown rice, and yuzu ume added to give it a zesty kick. It comes with a portion of Salmon Poke (which we shared) and the House Salad ($16.90). Itâ€™s our second time ordering during this CB :) Day 31 of #circuitbreakersg
