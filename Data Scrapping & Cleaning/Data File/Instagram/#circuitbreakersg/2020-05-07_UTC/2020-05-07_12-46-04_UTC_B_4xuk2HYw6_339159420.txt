#Circuitbreakersg Day 31
.
A little sweet treat today - souffl√© pancakes from @tamagoen_sg
.
I miss being able to sit at a place to eat and drink. The taste of food served directly from the kitchen is always the best isn't it?
. 
Soon enough, we will all be able to enjoy a leisurely meal (and drinks) with loved ones and friends and that's what we are all contributing towards by staying home
.
But for now, even a takeaway of my fav food is enough to lift my day
