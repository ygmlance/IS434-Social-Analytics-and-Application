Shiitake (香/花/冬菇) is an amazing source of carb, fiber as well as protein. It contains countless nutrients such as riboflavin, selenium, zinc, copper, vitamin B5, B6 & D which collectively create blood cells to promote regular heartbeat, strong bone development and thyroid health. It also strengthens mental capabilities by preventing forgetfulness, elevating mood to combat migraines & depression, which in turn has a positive effect on vision.

Shiitake is often recommended for heart health because it has an enzyme that is a good cholesterol, but blocks bad cholesterol absorption in the gut and at the same time, contains beta glucans (fiber) that lowers cholesterol in general.

Most important, Shiitake is laden with polysaccharides which increase human immunity to fight inflammation. Hence a great natural tonic to combat cancer and arthritis.

Hope this answers most of the queries many of you are PMing us about. *Shiitake has its origins traced to China during the Song Dynasty. Why it bears a Japanese name in English is a long story on its own. You can easily find the history of that development online.
