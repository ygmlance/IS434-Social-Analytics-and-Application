Our first attempt in making this Basque Burnt Cheesecake, almost gave up initially cos we had trouble making heavy cream using milk and butter, but we surely had fun "throwing" the ingredients into the food processor and watching it does its magic turning our block of cheese into this yummilicious creation. 
Served cold, the cheesecake is soft n creamy yet crispy on the edges, it's amazing!! #basqueburntcheesecake #simplerecipe #homebakedwithlove #circuitbreakersg
