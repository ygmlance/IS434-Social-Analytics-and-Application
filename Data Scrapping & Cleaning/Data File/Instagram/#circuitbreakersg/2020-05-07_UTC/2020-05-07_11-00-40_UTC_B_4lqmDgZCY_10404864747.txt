Seafood Paella 🥘 Tonight’s dinner is abit challenging during the circuit breaker. There are a number of ingredients which I can’t find...
I used jasmine rice in place of Risotto, homemade roasted tomato paste rather than the can, Cajun instead of paprika and turmeric for the colour. No broth too, so the peeled prawn head and shell to the rescue 🧐.... Fortunately, it turned out fine, just abit more sourish as the tomatoes weren’t very ripe and the rice a little mushy. 
Good enough to call it Yummy 😋
