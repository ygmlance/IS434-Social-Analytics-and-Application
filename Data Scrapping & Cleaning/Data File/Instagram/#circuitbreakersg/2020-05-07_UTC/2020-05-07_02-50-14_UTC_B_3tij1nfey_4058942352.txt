ONCE UPON A TIME

Me: Evan don't sit so near to the computer screen. Not good for your eyes!
Evan: OK! 
And the next moment I see him doing the above. Laugh die me😆

I am sure for a lot of you, if you have kids at home during this CB, it must have been a hair-raising experience. But I am sure there would also have been funny moments too. Keep positive and keep laughing. ✌️💪 #sgchiropractor #workfromhome
