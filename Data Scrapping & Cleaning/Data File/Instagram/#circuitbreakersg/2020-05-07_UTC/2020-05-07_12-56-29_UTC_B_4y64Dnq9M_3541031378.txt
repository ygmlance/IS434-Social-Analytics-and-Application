What used to be steps are now a flat platform with light strips. Might as well, to avoid tripping and falling. The entire MBS shoppes were closed and in darkness. It feels strangely foreign. Like I am in an apocalyptic movie. I was tired after walking very long. I wanted to get to the Bayfront MRT station, but it seems like there was no way in.... I had no choice but to walk even further ðŸ˜ª my legs were walking for 2 over hours... #cbday31 #covid19life
