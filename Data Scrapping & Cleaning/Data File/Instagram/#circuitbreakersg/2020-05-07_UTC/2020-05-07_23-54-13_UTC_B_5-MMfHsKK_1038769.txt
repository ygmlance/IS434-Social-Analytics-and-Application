So the gov is giving us “better” reusable masks soon 😀 great cos my first one was misshapen after just one wash, and I could barely breathe in it. I tried out the 3-ply one from @1929mask : comfy and well-constructed! .
.
The 1929 Mask comprises three layers: the outermost layer is water repellent, the center layer is antimicrobial, and the innermost layer is moisture wicking (you know how the space gets humid with our breath!). Comes in two colours black and navy. Not cheap at $25 though. But comfy. .
.
There was only one drawback. The navy one was a little too big and could slip off my face easily. Here’s where their customer service stepped in with stellar recovery. They sent me petit versions they were testing. And these fit perfectly! So happy! See the size difference in the pic. .
