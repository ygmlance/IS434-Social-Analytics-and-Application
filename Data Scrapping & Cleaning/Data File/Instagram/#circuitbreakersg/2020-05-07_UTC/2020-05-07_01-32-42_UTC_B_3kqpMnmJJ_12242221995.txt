So... last week, i went out after work and bought a hell lot of dessert from my nearby shopping mall. My intention was to get my favourite strawberry shortcake from Four Leave.. But to my horror, the bakery is only selling bread amidst this circuit breaker exercise. After combing the whole mall and finding no cake... I went to the Japanese food street located at the basement and bought all these sweets.. hoping that it might appease my stomach.
