I was challenged by @visit_singapore to create a craft project at home by upcycling some common household products. So I upcycled some old tin cans and made a paper plant to accompany it! ☘️♻️
Quote myself – “Okay. It will never die, and I don’t need to water it. Everybody should do this at home!”😉
