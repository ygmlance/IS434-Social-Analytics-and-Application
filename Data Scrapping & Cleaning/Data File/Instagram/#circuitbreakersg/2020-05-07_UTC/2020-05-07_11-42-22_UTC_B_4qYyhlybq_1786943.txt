Basically a fancy way of combining coffee with milk. Kinda therapeutic though, seeing the milk drip down forming a sort of marble pattern. ⁣

If you wanna try making this, make sure to use a mix of small and large ice cubes to get the pattern! Small ice cubes are definitely a must. Coffee-wise, I combined 2 cups of the @nespresso.sg Fortissio Lungo (but I didn't use all of it as you can see in the video) and poured milk over it!
