"Foster mama having bad insomnia, cannot sleep well, so play time...to drain her energy.. 🤣 We have successfully trained foster mama to be a cat - nap during the day and wide awake at night!" - Elsa 🐾 #merrykittens ⁣

Swipe to see Elsa struggling to hold on to her toy...like how people struggling to hold on to that last bubble tea 🤪 ⁣

Day N of CB period, ending very soon 💪🏻 Looking forward to Elsa & Mistle going home! Adopt cats, they are around to keep you saint and entertained 😉 ⁣
