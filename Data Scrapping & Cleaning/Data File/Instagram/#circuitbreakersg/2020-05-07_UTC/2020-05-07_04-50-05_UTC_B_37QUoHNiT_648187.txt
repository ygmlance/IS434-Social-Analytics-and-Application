What’s for #lunch on #circuitbreakersg Day 31? I decided to fry up some #frozenprata and they were amazingly #authentic and #tasty ! I even made a #plasterprata - #prata with an egg fried and ‘plaster’ on top of it! And I had my #yummy #pratas with some #delish #mutton #curry ! And don’t worry - I ate them the right way - using my fingers! #yum #stayhomeforsg #sgunited
