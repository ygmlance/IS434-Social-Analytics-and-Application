in addition to 김치 찌개 and 달고나커피, I’ve attempted to make one my favourite dishes to get at Chinese restaurants - cold tofu with century egg. made do with pressed instead of silken tofu because that’s what I had lying around at home and recreated the sauce using a recipe I found online. sadly, it wasn’t able to match up with what I normally get when eating out, but it was still able to satisfy my cravings to an extent. #covid19 #circuitbreakersg
