[Special Treats for Super Parents]

During this COVID-19 situation, many families are finding it tough. There's a group of Super Parents with children with special needs who are facing extra challenges as their children are struggling with their disrupted routines. (https://bit.ly/3aEpdrY & https://bit.ly/3dmcQmq)

Be Kind SG is running a campaign to encourage these Super Parents. Will you join us by gifting them a set of muffins from @crunchy__teeth (a social enterprise that hires youths with special needs)? Do check out their Facebook page to find out more on what they do and causes they support! Pre-orders start from today till 16 May, and we will update on the final number of sets of muffins ordered for these Super Parents!

To support this campaign:
1. DM Crunchy Teeth or call/Whatsapp 9648 0067 to order the set of “Special Treats for Super Parents” muffins.
2. Each set of muffins will cost $25 ($20 for 6 muffins & $5 for delivery islandwide).
3. We will be working with Friends of ASD Families and caregiving support groups to identify these Super Parents. *Muffins will be delivered once the circuit breaker is lifted. 
4. Leave an encouraging message for these Super Parents (https://bit.ly/2SHRNTc) and we will handwrite them into cards to be sent to them!
