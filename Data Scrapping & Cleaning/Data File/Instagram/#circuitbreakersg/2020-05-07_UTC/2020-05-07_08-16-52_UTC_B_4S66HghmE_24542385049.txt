Happy Vesak Day but also happy Prep Day (for meðŸ˜…) ðŸ”ªðŸ¥’ðŸ¥¬ my top tips (below ðŸ‘‡) on what to do with a whole bunch of herbs: make an herb butter log! .
.
I had an interesting convo yesterday with @pajucooking about how to avoid wasting herbs (because tbh they wilt so quickly) and decided to share this prep tip. Chop up a whole bunch of different herbs in the quantity that I feel I won't be able to finish in my other dishes and mix it into soft butter. You can also add garlic and seasonings like salt, pepper, paprika etc, in it. It all really depends on your flavour preference! After mixing thoroughly, I roll it up in baking paper, seal the ends and FREEZE it. Then I have an aromatic butter ready for whenever I need it! You could always mix into a freezer friendly container, but I find it easier to chop off discs of butter than scrape frozen butter out of a tub. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

This herb butter is great in any dish like scrambled eggs, steak, garlic bread... So good! ðŸ˜‹

Also I don't throw away the leaves and ends of celery. Instead I clean, dry and freeze them so that when I have enough I can either make soup stock or cream of celery soup (where I will grind them up into pulp). Hope you like the tips! .
