Bcoz of my familyâ€™s eczema-prone skin, I have always been on a quest for the most natural and gentle Laundry detergent that caters to our hypersensitive skin. I came across the @truearthmovement Eco strips while shopping for some skin-loving Castile soaps at @thecastilesoapshop . Bought one pack home to try and Iâ€™m totally impressed by itâ€™s efficacy on eliminating odours from sweat-soiled clothes. Definitely better than any other brands I have tried. It is gentle to the skin without compromising on its cleaning power.

What are tru earth eco-strips?.
.
Each laundry strip packs ultra-concentrated, hypoallergenic, eco-friendly cleaning power into a tiny, pre-measured strip of liquidless laundry detergent that you just toss in the wash. Its low-sudsing formula works in all types of washing machines, including high-efficiency (HE). The smart formulation effectively seeks out and dislodges dirt molecules and stains, keeping them in suspension until they are rinsed away. It makes your laundry washing chore easier, healthier, more economical, and much kinder to our planet.

They are:
-Paraben-free
-Phosphate-free
-Free of added dyes
-Free of chlorine bleach
-Free of 1,4-dioxane
-Readily biodegradable
-Hypoallergenic
-Vegan: no animal-based ingredients or testing on animals .

Visit @thecastilesoapshop Website to place your orders now.  I ordered a few more to stock up and received my products the very next day!.

By the way, one of the things I love about the #circuitbreakersg is definitely the reduced laundry load. ðŸ˜‚ .
