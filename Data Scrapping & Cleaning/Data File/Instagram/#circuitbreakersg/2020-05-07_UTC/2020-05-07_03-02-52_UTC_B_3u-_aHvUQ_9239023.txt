Thank you @fu__chia for sending these in! Colouring is therapeutic and I love seeing how kids and grown-ups get creative with my colouring sheets! These were done by a 4 year old, 6 year old and a good friend of mine. These colouring sheets don't have to be perfect, they just have to be done with love! #CarouselleLearning
