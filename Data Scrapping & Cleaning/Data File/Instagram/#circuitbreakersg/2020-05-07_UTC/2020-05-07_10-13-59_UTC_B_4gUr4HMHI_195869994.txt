[20.20 May 7: Circuit Breaker Day 31] Red Rice Wine Mee sua is a Hock Chew dish and yes, I am a Hock Chew. Unfortunately, my grandparents had passed on, I have no chance to learn this dialect as I speak to my dad in Mandarin and Cantonese with my mum.

I vaguely remembered that my grandmother used to cook this  dish occasionally. Not commonly found outside too, especially nice ones. Let me know if you know of one that is nice!

Usually eaten on birthdays or first day of Chinese New Year. This dish is also makes great confinement dish! Attempted my first cooking this and hope to learn how to make the Ang Zhao if time permits. 
Thanks @tgskaren for always sharing nice food with me! Seriously, I didn't expect the 'Ang Zhao' residue and wine to be sent all the way down to me on the same evening just because I liked it. Not sure what have I done to deserve an angel like you around me but I am definitely counting my blessings. ♥️
