First it was the yeast, then it was the flour. Amongst the list of some of the constantly sold-out items. Also, in the sea of banana cakes and breads and burnt cheesecakes, while I have some remaining flour (I swear there is no hoarding here), one of the things I made are these luncheon bun babies. They look like tongues sticking out of a mouth.
