Experimented with another routine today and got the brother to join in.
.
Beginning (4 sets)
- 10x Archer / Normal Push Ups
- 10x Sitting leg raisers over KB - 10x Half Burpee to squat jump
.
Middle (5 sets) - 7x Bicep curls to front raise
- 7x Overhead side to side slam
- 7x Side lunges
- 7x Sitting knee tucks
.
End (5 sets)
- 20x KB swings
- 20x Commando planks (also because @ytptofficial #weeklychallenge)
.
Not bad. Quite balanced I must say. Gonna try out more hybrid and high mobility exercises next time. .
Oh, and swipe left for some homemade treats. Have not baked for the longest time and I was worried it would be a disaster. But it turned out pretty good! Both first and second batch of Banana Walnut Cake was tastyyyyy! And of course, boba milk tea can't go wrong~
