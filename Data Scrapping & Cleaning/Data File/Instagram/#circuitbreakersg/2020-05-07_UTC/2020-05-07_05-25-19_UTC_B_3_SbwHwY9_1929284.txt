Happy Vesak Day. Happy CB Day 31 of 56. 
Didn’t jump into the “making your own Dalgona Coffee” bandwagon  earlier as I don’t like to drink Instant Coffee mix. Always prefer my coffee to be latte,  without sugar.

As I need to try out the power of my milk frother in whisking, I just try to see if it is possible using Nespresso capsules, without cream nor egg white and reduced sugar. 
Turned out the mixture is unable to reach the stiff peak without much sugar. 
No more Dalgona Coffee for me again as I still find it is too sweet.

Still like my latte “kosong”. #CBday31 #circuitbreakersg  #nespressodalgona  #reducedsugar #starbucksnespresso  #stayhome #stayhomelife
