Wishing all Buddhists a Happy Vesak Day and the rest a happy holiday!
.
Would like to share some key reasons why swimming should start from a very young age.
.
1. Babies and toddlers can really learn to love the water.
.
2. Babies and toddlers can potentially learn some livesaving skills.
.
3. Babies and toddlers can develop to more advanced stage when they are developmentally ready and these skills will comes naturally when they start early.
.
There are also benefits and evidences to help the baby and toddler to develop socially, emotionally, mentally and physically. .
Swim Safe, Swim Happy.
