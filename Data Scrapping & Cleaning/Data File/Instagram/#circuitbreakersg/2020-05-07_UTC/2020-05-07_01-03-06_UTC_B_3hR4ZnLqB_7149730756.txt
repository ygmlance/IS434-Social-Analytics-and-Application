"Since I was young, my life has been challenged by adversities. I got rejected from a ballet class when I was four for being plump, I struggled with bulimia for over 20 years since I was 11 and as a mother, I struggled to conceive and even lost a child in a past pregnancy.⠀
⠀
However, I try not to let those get me down for long. I actually feel that the larger the setback, the more it motivates me to bounce back. I guess that’s the mindset you’ve got to embrace when you’re a mother of four, managing five food distribution companies and a few non-profit organisations to help distribute food to the vulnerable communities.⠀
⠀
Recently with the circuit breaker in effect, things are busier than ever because of the increasing number of cases across Singapore from families with lost incomes. It’s even more challenging to maintain a balance between work and family; with keeping the kids entertained during their Home Based Learning, and spending quality time with my husband. It really isn’t the easiest thing to do.⠀
⠀
Having said that, I’m actually grateful for the experience that this situation is providing us. I get to spend more time with my kids before leaving for work in the late morning. And I tell them that though we’re in the midst of a change in the world right now, we’re going to have inspiring stories to tell growing up.⠀
⠀
I think what keeps me positive, regardless of any trial, is the knowledge that I’m fortunate to be able to do what I love and help people while I’m at it. I’m fortunate to have four amazing children and a supportive husband who keeps me sane and grounded after a crazy day at work. I’m fortunate to be able to experience the triumphs and setbacks of being a mother every day. This is why I treasure every moment and embrace every wrench life throws at me, I want to show my kids that anyone can conquer the world if they want to – they just need to have the right perspective."⠀
