07May2020🌕Feeling over the moon (pun intended🤓) seeing the last Full SuperMoon of the year in Scorpio♏️. She looked so much bigger and brighter, truly magnificent✨💛 The shots taken from my phone didn’t do her justice at all. .

🦋This full moon will guide us towards understanding and admiration of endings. With each ending, you get new beginnings. All things bad can be detoxified and cleansed out your soul and mind, and it prepares your body for the next eclipse.

🦋This SuperMoon signifies transformation, to shed the skin before putting on a new one, to start again, to give ourselves the confidence to make change happen ~ taken from Conscious Reminder✨
