Ok both kids asleep. Now I go look for my husband in his home office... heâ€™s been working so hard. Work from home = weekend, nights, public holiday also work... hard to switch off work mode ðŸ˜…. But he said heâ€™s going to cook me a steak tonight. So I go kacau him now ðŸ˜‚. #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #workfromhome #sgsahm #sgtoddler #sgkids #sleepbabysleep #sgmom
