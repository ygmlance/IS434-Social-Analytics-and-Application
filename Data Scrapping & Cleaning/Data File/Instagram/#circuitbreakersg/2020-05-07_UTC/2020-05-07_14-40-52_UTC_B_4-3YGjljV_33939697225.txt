~ Paella with airgrilled cod fish ~ Attempted a Spanish affair for lunch today. I hardly have capsicum at home; the daddy won't eat it and I'm not sure if the Simlets like it. It was a positive experience and I think I shall make it redder next time. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #paella #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
