Day 3 Hols = Day 31 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Glutes Day with Heather Robertson 
#7dayabchallenge

Today's workout was on the Glutes and Thighs. Intense on a particular body part today and it was intense. I did 3 rounds of the 5 min Glutes activation and the thigh workout. My ache will come later. DOMS u know. 
Into Day 4 of the #7dayabchallenge, making me sweat like buckets as usual.. The 2nd workout was killing me with all of it doing 1 MINUTE each! How to survive Day 5 to 7? 
Anyway, Happy Vesak Day to all and #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
