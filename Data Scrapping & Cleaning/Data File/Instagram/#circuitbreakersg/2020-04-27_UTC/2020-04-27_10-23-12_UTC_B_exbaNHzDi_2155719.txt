My other dinner dish is also a canned food. Don’t judge me, I do take canned food. 
I have expanded my canned sardine and it became Spicy Sour Sardine Fish. 
Added lady’s fingers, lemongrass, yellow onion, assam pieces, dried chilli, vinegar, turmeric powder and black pepper. Gosh it smells so good and whet my appetite! 
Bon Appetit! 🤤
