Why are dentists advised against treating smokers during the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker? 
Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to develop COVID-19 infection. People who light up are more susceptible to serious lung diseases and infections. They are also more prone to heart disease, apparently the highest risk factor for COVID-19 deaths. Moreover, cigarette smoke causes immunosuppression, decreasing survival rate should they get infected with the virus. Ordinarily, smokers need closer dental care than the general population. But not for now. Smokers, for your own safety, please stay home during the Circuit Breaker. #sunshinedental #sunshinedentalsg #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #covid19 #covid19sg #singapore #staysafe #stayhomestaysafe #dentalclinic #dentalclinicsg
