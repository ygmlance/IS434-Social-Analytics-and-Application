Today is a canned food day for me. I’m lazy and I didn’t want to go to the market because most of the stalls will be closed on a Monday. I couldn’t rid the images of a friend’s pork trotter dish thus I decided to cheat and used the canned pork trotter and converted it to Canned Pork Trotter Rice. 
I added some cabbages, mushrooms, carrots and a can of stewed peanuts and seasoning and it became a rice dish! 
And my other dish is coming up!
