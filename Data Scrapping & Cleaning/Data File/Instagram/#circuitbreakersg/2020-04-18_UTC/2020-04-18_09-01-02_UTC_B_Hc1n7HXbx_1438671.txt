A video I did awhile ago. Haha!

I love oatmeal. The savoury one.
Yes! I love savoury oatmeal cos it's the next best thing to a comforting bowl of porridge which is so carb loaded it gives me a bad tummy. I'm so thankful my friend @liong_wailoon introed me to savoury oatmeal back in Uni days!

May this inspire you to go from eeeeeyucks to YUMS!

Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons oatmeal
- 1 teaspoon Lao Gan ma
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce (can omit)
- your favourite vegetables
- your favourite meat (mine is salmon belly cos it cooks fast)
- egg
