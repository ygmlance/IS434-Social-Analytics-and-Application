We have enquiries on art videos for age 19 months to 3 yo! Here's a complimentary video done by the Go Bananas! team to all of you. Another tip: You can also replace the magazine or newspaper cut outs with cellophane paper instead. The craft will eventually turn out to be a big giant flower that allows sunshine through. The perfect opportunity to learn about warm versus cold colours as we held the cellophane flower up to the light of day. ðŸ¤ª ðŸŒˆ #videooftheday #preschoolers #funartcraft #artsandcrafts #gobananasathome
