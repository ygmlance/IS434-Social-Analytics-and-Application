On the day when govt implemented no bubble tea by 23:59, I had a little 小插曲 with @honeymillsg ! I thot of ordering them a few days after but with the sudden extension and increased stricter regulation, I Thot I had to wait another month before I can try! Who knows, they suddenly decided to let me feel #小幸運！they extended their hours to 23:59 and fulfilled our orders! And coz it’s honey, not milk tea, we kept and stored our orders for another 3 days and it still tasted good (and felt healthy!) who knows it’s a false alarm, they CAN STILL OPERATE! So if u want, you can still order from @honeymillsg !
