To celebrate my new song release, I did a cooking interview with @ricemedia.co making @sukasukasauce Jerk Chicken. I sent host @marizzecaine a jar of mah SAWSE and we cheffed it up together via IG Live, including rap breakdowns while chopping onions (not easy!) Our results were a little different but thereâ€™s still time in this #circuitbreakersg world to fine tune those culinary skills! Take time at home to enjoy all the ways you can create - your belly might thank you for it! 
Huge thank you to @__edoardo for making this craziness happen, Iâ€™m cooking for you when this is all over. <Swipe Left to watch the cheffery!> .

Suka Suka Sauce is a 100% all natural Jamaican Jerk marinade grown and made locally in SE Asia. I have been developing this delicious product with my team to become a new platform for sharing SE Asia music (cause you gotta put on good music to cook good food!) Since #SocialDistancing became a thing, we sold out completely of #sukasukasauce. Visit www.sukasukasauce.com to back order this hot commodity! .
