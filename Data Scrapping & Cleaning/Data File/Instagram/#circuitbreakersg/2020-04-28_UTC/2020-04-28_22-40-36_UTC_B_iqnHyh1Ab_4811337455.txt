If you've been following the news, you've probably heard of the new restrictions that was set for Home based businesses. Insyplusyou has relied on 3rd party delivery parties since the very start and thus this affects our existing and future orders. We hope that this is a temporary measure, and that it will truly help Singapore in controlling our COVID-19 situation. 🤲🙏 Our STAY-HOME SALE is still ongoing and you can consider to advance order for your little one's birthday celebrations for later this year too! For any clarifications, do just drop us a DM/WA. 💌

Many love and appreciation for your support and encouragement! We hope to have your continuous support for us small home based businesses. 💕💕💕 #insygoodyou #stayhome #staysafe #sgunited #sglocal #circuitbreakersg #homebasedbusiness
