Here u go for those who have been waiting! Don’t have to queue and spend so much because brownies are so easy to bake! But I tweak it for the bake-off. Thanks to @buttermilkbysam for the wonderful recipe and  definitely sharing it here with everyone. 
There are some personal tweaks that I made. .
.
Butter 👉🏻 I use salted as I feel that salt cuts the ’jelak’ (overwhelmingly rich) taste and brings out the flavor better. .
.
Cocoa 👉🏻 use dark chocolate Dutch processed cocoa. BUT need to increase sugar level as it tends to be more bitter/ burnt/ chaotah, can use less or do a mix .
.
.
Method is the same as posted here. .
.
Now go try and let me know if yours is successful! Send some ❤️ to your mother & yourself for the upcoming Mother’s Day! .

If not, I’ll pitched it at 50cents cheaper & don’t need to queue! 🤪. #selfcollection 🤔Think I can start cooking/ baking blog after this SG Circuit Breaker -COVID19. 
Orthodontics still my 1st ❤️ cos don’t need to wash dishes/ instruments.
