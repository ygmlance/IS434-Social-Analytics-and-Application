I like posting photos of the food I had in my Instagram and Facebook cause I like to look back at them, ogle at it and reminisce the taste of it. I think I’ll be revisiting these photos many times for a long while 😍😍😍 #oysters #lockdown #circuitbreakersg #thankyouforthisfood #foodislove #foodislife #foodisfuel #fresh #freshseafood #freshoysters #freshlyshucked #yum #yummy #yumyum #nomnom #icandiehappynow #foodstagram #sgeats #sgeat #foodiesg #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #foodporn @theoystercart #theoystercart #whatsfordinner #myprecious #bigoyster #sofresh #iwanttoeatyouagain #foodie
