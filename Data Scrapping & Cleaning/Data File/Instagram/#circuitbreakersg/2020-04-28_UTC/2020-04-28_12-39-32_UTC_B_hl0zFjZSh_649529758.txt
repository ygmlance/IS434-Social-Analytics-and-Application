Woohoo yummy plus super easy Chocolate Chip Oat Cookies made with @captainoats1965 new Instant Rolled Oats, bananas & chocolate chips! All we did was mash 2 bananas, mix 3 packets of Instant Rolled Oats in, add in chocolate chips & then baked them! That’s all! 😍 Super easy plus a fun bonding activity with Hayley!
