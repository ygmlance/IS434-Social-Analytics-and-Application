Happy #internationaldanceday2020! 
Battu is one of the most traditional pure dance choreography by Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra in praise of Lord Batuka Bhairava, one of the 64 aspects of Lord Shiva.
This is the beginning of Battu segment where you are introduced to the Odissi musicians who accompany the repertoire- the Veena, Mardala, Flute and Gini players! What is most fascinating is that the musicians on the Kalinga temple sculptures at Odisha feature an all female music ensemble! Here is my personal rendition embodying those musicians who are an integral part of a live dance performance. 
This clip is dedicated to all those dancers who are #stayinghome and practicing their dance forms and to the frontliners who are waging the battle against #covid_19.
