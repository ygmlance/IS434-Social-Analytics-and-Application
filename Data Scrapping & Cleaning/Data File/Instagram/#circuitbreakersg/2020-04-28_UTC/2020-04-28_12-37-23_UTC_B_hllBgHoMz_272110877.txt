Day 21. Love the view of sunrise today. One of my motivation to wake up early every morning. Brunch - some rosti waffles, lemon thyme chicken thighs and poached broccoli. Nom took over the keyboard during my live lesson. Another afternoon storm. Gloomy, yet therapeutic.#stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #mypetathome #spendingtimewithfamily #instadaily
