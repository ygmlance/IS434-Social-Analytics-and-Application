Running out of instant yeast at home and can't find any at the store?
Now is the perfect opportunity to try and make natural yeast.
This is our yeast water using dried apricot which you can also swap with  raisins, apples and many more. With fermentation for 4 - 7 days, you can use the yeast water as a substitution of your instant yeast.

If you are interested in making, check out the guide video link shared in the bio.
