“Masks reveal the shape of your soul and the state of the world and, in today’s world, everyone wears a mask.” - Chloe Thurlow.
My mask has flowers, because my favourite quote of all time is Matisse’s - “There are always flowers for those who want to see them”. Let these dark days pass by quickly. 
Stay home. Stay safe. Stay sane. 💕 
Grazie per la mia  maschera @almalu.sg @mybabyalma 🙏❤️
