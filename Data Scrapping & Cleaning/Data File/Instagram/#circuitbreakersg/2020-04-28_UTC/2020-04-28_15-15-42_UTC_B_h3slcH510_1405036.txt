Day 22.

Thankful to have met a bunch of talented women from @womenofcourage_asia

Working together and contributing to empower other women for non commercial gain is really what makes this group so special.

We had a very informative and inspiring meeting earlier today where leaders shared about physical and mental health issues!

In photo is a throwback to the 1st anniversary celebration. I had the privilege to work with the sponsors and happy to meet some of them in person!

What are you grateful for today?
