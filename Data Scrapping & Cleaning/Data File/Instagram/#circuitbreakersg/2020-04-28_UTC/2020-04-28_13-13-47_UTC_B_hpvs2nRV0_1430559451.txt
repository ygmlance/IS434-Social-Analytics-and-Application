'You know, there's a tendency to think when a relationship comes to an end that it's failed somehow. I think it's only failed to last a long time. I think everyone you meet has a lesson for you, and people you fall in love with can teach you an awful lot. And I think, essentially, this song is about that,' said the gent in the centre.

And this song is @aboveandbeyond's 'Sun and Moon', featuring @cobimusic. In 2016, Jono Grant, Tony McGuinness (that gent) and Paavo SiljamÃ¤ki left the electronic music world *behind* and embarked on an ambitious world tour 'Acoustic II' that culminated at the Hollywood Bowl, LA. In front of a sold-out crowd and accompanied by a 34-piece orchestra, A&B showcased two hours of songs from their much-loved archive, reimagined for one of the world's most famous stages.

I've been listening to them on and offâ€”I feel the abovementioned show isn't as 'beautiful' as their 2014 one at London's intimate Porchester Hall (also on YT)â€”as I work steadily on a personal project...to be revealed on 1 May. ðŸ˜‰
