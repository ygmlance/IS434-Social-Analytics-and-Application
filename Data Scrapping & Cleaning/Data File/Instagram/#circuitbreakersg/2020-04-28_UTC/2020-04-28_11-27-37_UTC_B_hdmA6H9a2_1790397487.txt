Circuit Breaker Weekend #3: Cotton Sponge Cake. Ingredients: 4 egg whites in a clean dry mixing bowl + 4 egg yolks + 1egg. 60g unsalted butter, 100ml of milk. 80g of sifted plain flour, 80g of granulated sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, and optional item for 1tsp gingerbread spice or 1tsp cinnamon. _________________________________________________Procedure 1: melt the 60g unsalted butter in a mixing bowl dipped into a bigger bowl of hot water. Add 100ml of milk and stir to mix well. Add 80g sifted plain flour in several batches into the butter mix and followed by adding 4 egg yolks. Add 1 egg and 1/4 tsp salt into the batter and mix well. Add the optional gingerbread spice or cinnamon if you wish _________________________________________________Procedure 2: in the mixing bowl containing 4 pure egg whites, use an electric mixer at medium speed and whisk till it becomes thick and foamy. Add the 80g sugar in 3 batches and whisk at high speed till stiff peaks formed. _________________________________________________Procedure 3: use a spatula to scoop one portion of the whisked egg whites and add into the batter mix. Fold to mix ( do not overdo it ). Pour the batter mixture back into the bowl containing the rest of the whisked egg whites and fold to mix evenly. Pour the final mix into a square pan lined with baking paper and “drop” the pan several times to remove excessive bigger bubbles. Use a scraper to even out the surface lightly ( also to remove bubbles on surface ). Place the square pan into a tray half filled with hot water in a pre-heated oven at 150 degree celcius for 90-100min till the cake tester comes clean. Once ready, remove pan from oven, and remove the baking paper at its sides first  and let it cool on the baking paper for 1 hour before serving.
