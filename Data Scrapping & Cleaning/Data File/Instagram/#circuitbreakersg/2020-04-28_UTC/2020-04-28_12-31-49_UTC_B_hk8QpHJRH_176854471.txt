Not your typical Hainanese Pork Chop.  We have name this the AMK 婆婆海南 pork chop.  This version was created by my maternal grandmother and it has always been our family favourite.  Non crispy, no cream crackers, no green peas, no tomato sauce.  The sliced pork loin are seasoned with dark soya sauce, tomato wedges and garlic.  I believe 阿婆 uses tomato wedges to tenderise the pork loin so when you pan-fry them it will not turn tough.  With 9 kids 阿婆 frugal fixes can be seen in many of the dishes she cooked.
