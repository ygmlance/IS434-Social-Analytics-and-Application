Already missing my Sling Singapore Resilence dinner set and MI roll from last Sunday..in this season of circuitbreaker, remember to indulge a little & pamper yourself. The vegetables is sooo good & appetizing! 😋😋❤️❤️ Only wish the curry fries was still crispy hot by the time it arrived. But no choice I stay too far from the Restaurant. 😂 Cannot wait for this season to end so we can all go out and eat piping hot served fries & food! #stayathome #circuitbreakersg #wrongpairing #dontcare #selfcareisimportant #curryfries #sgresilence #stayunited #sgparents #indulgeyourself #maisonikkoku #covid19season @curlycrypto
