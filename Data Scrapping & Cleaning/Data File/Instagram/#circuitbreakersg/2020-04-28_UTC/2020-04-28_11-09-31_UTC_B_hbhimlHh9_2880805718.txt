Jumping on the home workout bandwagon üí™üèº Have a sturdy counter in your crib? Try these two exercises if you're bored of doing push ups on the floor. ‚Å£
‚Å£
The first exercise is essentially like the straight bar dip (the top part of a muscle-up), while the second exercise is like the Korean dip. But since you're not working with a bar your body won't be able to come under your hands, and you'll have to contact the counter with your toes/feet.
‚Å£
I'm showing 5 reps per exercise here, but you can do however many sets and reps you wish. These two drills should give you a pretty good chest, shoulder and tricep workout. Do them smoothly; lower under control and push up into a strong lockout. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Will be posting more home workout ideas so stay tuned! Feel free to ask me any questions.
