Everyone's at different stages of coping, we're almost a month into the #circuitbreakersg, so time for a mental health check:⁣ Comment with how you're feeling. ⁣⠀
⁣⠀
❤️ - I’m doing great⁣⠀
💜 - I’m doing only okay⁣⠀
💚 - I’m starting to struggle⁣⠀
💙 - I’m having a hard time ⁣⠀
💛 - I need someone to talk to⁣⠀
🧡 - My DMs are open for anyone⁣⠀
