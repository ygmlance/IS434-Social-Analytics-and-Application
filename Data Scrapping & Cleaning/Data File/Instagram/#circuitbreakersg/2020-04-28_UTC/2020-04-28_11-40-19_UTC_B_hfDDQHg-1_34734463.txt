Join me for the month of May on a challenge to have a green juice every day for 30 days. Definition of green juice: Your juice is 80-90% cruciferous greens. One big glass a day! Doesn’t have to replace a meal but should be consumed on an empty stomach at least an hour before your meal. There are heaps of benefits from flooding your digestive system with raw greens and this is one thing that’s easy to commit to when we are at home every day. It’s way better for you than tanking up on heaps of instant ramen (or, for the Americans, Clorox!). Anyway, it’s something I am going to be doing so if you want to join me, use the hashtag #greeneverydayformay and/or tag me on stories if that’s where you’re posting it. Let’s use this circuit breaker to transform ourselves and emerge anew. #greenjuice #huromslowjuicer #kale #circuitbreakersg
