Happy Birthday to me 🎉😆😆😆! It has reached a point where I’ve stopped keeping track of my age. I just know that I’m twenty-something 👻. No fancy restaurant or dinner but I am safe with my family and that’s good enough. Thank you to all who wished me and special thanks to sis for arranging all of these in quarantine - was shooketh when I came out of my room 🤡🤡🤡.
