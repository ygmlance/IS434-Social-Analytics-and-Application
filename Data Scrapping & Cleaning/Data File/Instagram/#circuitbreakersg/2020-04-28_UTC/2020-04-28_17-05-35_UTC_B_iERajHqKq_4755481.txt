#ebelskiver for #dessert. 
Apparently a Danish stuffed pancake containing jam. 
Years ago @the_gossamerstar gifted me a #takoyakipan which I never got round to using but always wanted to. Thought Iâ€™d try making this which I first ate more than 20 years ago at #betterbatters at Chip Bee Gardens (does anyone still remember the place?). The takoyakipan is a bit smaller than the ones for ebelskivers but operates on the same principle. Took a few tries to get the right balance of heat, batter and timing.  The damaged ones were concealed under a dusting of #icing sugar. 
I tried it with #storebought #jam, and #kaya and I thought the jam worked better. 
Looking forward to trying these out again with a better quality filling. Apparently apples are a thing, as is lingonberry jam.
