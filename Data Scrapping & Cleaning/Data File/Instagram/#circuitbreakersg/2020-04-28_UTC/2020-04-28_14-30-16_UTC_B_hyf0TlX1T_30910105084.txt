Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 22:
Prepared a healthy set mealüç± for our lunch this week-
1. Grilled salmon fillet
2. Stir-fried zucchini, carrots, mushrooms and brocolli
3. Homemade tamagoyaki

The original plan for the veggie dish was to stir fry zucchini and mushrooms. BUT THE ZUCCHINIS SHRANK SO MUCH! So I had to throw in my last stash of frozen carrots and brocolli into the mix üòî Dont think I'm going to cook zucchini again any time soon. Pretty expensive for such a small amount of cooked veggies.

On a side note, I really like theü•ö tamagoyaki I made today. Instead of using dashi, I added pepper, sesame oil and fish sauce into the beaten egg mixture. ‚ù§ Love the flavour of the sesame oil and pepper in the eggs.
