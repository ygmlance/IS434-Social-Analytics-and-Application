Ingredients
1 slab 3 layer pork
1 slab pork collar (for lean meat lover)
5 garlic skin on
5 thick slice ginger skin on
A bottle of black dog vinegar, ACV for KETO

Methods
1. Blanched pork from cold to boil watering
2. Smashed the ginger and garlic slightly
3. Cut the blanched pork into large cubes, 2cm
4. Throw pork into wok and fry without oil.
5. Once oil start forming, add in garlic/ginger
6. Continue to stir fry till fragrance and change of colour.
7. Prepare hard boiled eggs.
8. Transfer everything into a pot, 1 portion of vinegar to 1 portion of water till pork is covered slightly
9. Bring to a boil, and reduce to medium small. Continue for 45min.
10. Your sauce level should be sufficiently low to simmer at smallest fire. I prefer to add eggs in now. You may add earlier.
11. May serve after 15min, or sooner depending on water level.

Notes
- hard boiled egg is easily prepared by boiling water from cold to hot with eggs in pot. Once boiled, turn fire off and leave it inside for 10min.
- portion of vinegar to water maybe 1:1, 1:2 or 1:3, depending on your preference.

Really no effort recipe. #easyrecipes #noeffort
