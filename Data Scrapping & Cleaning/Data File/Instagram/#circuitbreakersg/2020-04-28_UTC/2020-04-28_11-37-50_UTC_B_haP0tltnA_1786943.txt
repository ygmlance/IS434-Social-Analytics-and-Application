Spanish Latte seems like a very fancy name, but it's actually an espresso-based condensed milk latte. Making it is oh-so-simple! Add condensed milk, ice cubes, milk and a shot of espresso to your cup and wala! You have Spanish Latte. 
It was sort of a comfort to me because this drink reminds me of Singapore's Kopi Peng, and I haven't stepped out of the house to buy local coffee for a very long time.
