[20.20 April 28: Circuit Breaker Day 22] I remembered my boss telling me he does not like to 没有叶子的菜. Ok, lady fingers have no leaves right but he ate this earlier hor 😂

Using the leftover tub of Assam sauce from @gumajia 's Fusion Trio Fish/ Pork Burgers set, I minced some garlic and chopped up some hae bee and gave it a fry to make it more fragrant.

Added in Lady Fingers, Assam sauce and some shrimps. Added some sugar to taste and water.

First attempt in cooking lady fingers 😂 and I think there will be more to come! #StayhomewithAscott #SerenesCookbook2020
