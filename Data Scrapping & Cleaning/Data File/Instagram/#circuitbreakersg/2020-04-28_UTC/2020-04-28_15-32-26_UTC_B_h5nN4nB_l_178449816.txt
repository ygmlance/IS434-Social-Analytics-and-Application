Day 22 of the #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Decided to visit a smaller supermarket today just to see if perhaps the baking section would be spared. Alas no, stupid idea because still no chocolate chips to be found. I know I can use normal chocolate for baking, but did you know chocolate these days is not cheap? A normal 100gm bar of chocolate costs $7 (Lindt) or $5.50 (Cadbury), whereas the baking chocolate chips cost $7 for 350 gm. Guess I'll really have to use my stash of chocolate bought from NZ coz those bars cost only $2.
.
Anyway aside from the "non-essentials", some would argue as essential for well-being though, I still managed to get essential food groceries. One of the things I got was this beancurd layer thing which I decided to make into a sesame beancurd "noodle salad". If you love beancurd, you will love this! Super simple to make too.
.
All you have to do is take out the beancurd and separate the layers. Slice them thinly to get the "noodles". DO NOT slice first or you will end up with the idiotic task of separating the layers strand by strand as they will not automatically separate (as I found out). Give them a quick boil, drain and toss liberally with sesame oil. I used about 2 - 3 tablespoons of sesame oil + 1 tbsp of soya sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds if you have. That's it!
