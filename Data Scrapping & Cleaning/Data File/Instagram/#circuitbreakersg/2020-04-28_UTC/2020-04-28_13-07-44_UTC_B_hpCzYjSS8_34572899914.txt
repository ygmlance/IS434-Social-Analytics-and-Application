What we are doing: ­ЪџЏ
Delivershare supports hawkers with their own delivery services (not third party ones like foodpanda, grab etc.) through helping them to expand their outreach! We promote their stores & obtain good price deals for you! РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
WhatРђЎs in it for everyone? ­ЪДљ
By ordering through us, these hawkers can experience an increase in sales which would be extremely helpful during these difficult times. Deliveries will also become more efficient as riders do not have to travel as far between each order Рў║№ИЈ

The customers (you!!!) can also enjoy lower delivery costs with group buys and more food options!! ­ЪЇю­ЪўЃ РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ
