A short excerpt of “River Flows in You” by Yiruma. I love his compositions and I wish I could play all of them! 😌 I’ve been brushing up on my piano skills with @johnmonteiropiano during this Circuit Breaker period, and I decided to back to a piece I haven’t touched since @lasallesingapore days. 🎹 It feels good getting back to playing the piano again, and I’m hoping this will make me a better songwriter as well. 🥰
