#CircuitBreakerSG D-22
Who like Chilli Crab? I'm sure most Singaporeans do. I'm not a "crabby" person but love dipping Mantou with the sauce. Was suddenly craving for it and made my own Mantou from scratch.

No crab, so we make do with Chilli Prawn with Mantou. #cravingsatisfied

The other 2 dishes are Blanched Baby Kailan & Onion Egg.

Enjoy your dinner too!
