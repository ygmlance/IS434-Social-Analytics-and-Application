Need to stay occupied during #circuitbreaker? 
Get an #oldmagazine. Take a couple of pages and fold them. #quill them one page after another until you get the size you want. If you have #modpodge or other non toxic coating materials, it'll do... My work has to wait until I can go to the craft store again 😁
