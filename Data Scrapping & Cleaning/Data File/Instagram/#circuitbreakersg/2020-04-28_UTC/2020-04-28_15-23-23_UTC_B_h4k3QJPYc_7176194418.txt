Hang in there, chaps! ‚ô•Ô∏è We can get through this together. Think positive, look to the future, lift the spirits of those around you, keep healthy and stay home so we can all see our closest and mostest soon.

A big thank you to everyone out there helping to keep the community safe and in high spirits ‚Äî from hawkers, restaurants and cleaning staff to volunteers, waste collectors and healthcare and vet care workers. Not forgetting the lovely hoomans who deliver dog kibble to families across #SG!

And do think about supporting our friends @spcasingapore as they continue to be there for animals that need help during this challenging time. Link in bio! üêæ
