Food Travel: ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° é¦™æ¸¯ - Hong Kong (Heung-gkong in Cantonese)
.
Simple HK cafe-style dinner - dry vegetarian noodles in sauce with luncheon meat and egg + nourishing papaya milk Xin Zhu mi fen æ–°ç«¹ç±³ç²‰ with sweet corn and enoki mushrooms + freshly grated purple carrot, green and white radish salad with cherry tomatoes and Korean strawberries on the side
.
Reminiscent of the egg noodles that my Dad likes to cook for us on the weekends, though I can never replicate the exact same taste of his sauce mix... this time, itâ€™s about 90% ðŸ™‚
.
Bought the cut papaya slices from the fruit stall across the road on my ðŸ˜· grocery run.
