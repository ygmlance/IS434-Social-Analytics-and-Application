Anyone here misses going to your parents’ house for meals?

I miss going to my parents’ house for dinner once in a week. Other than catching up with them, it’s also my ‘off day’ from the kitchen.  My kids are starting to ask for 婆婆’s food these few days. My son misses grandma’s 麻婆豆腐 so I try cooking for him. But he says 婆婆的比较好吃😋 I think circuit breaker makes me appreciate my parents’ cooking more even though they are not fantastic cooks. Lucky are those who get to eat food cooked by their parents everyday. Please treasure them and ensure that you give them enough pocket money to cover the ingredients cost. These few weeks of cooking at home may make many realise how expensive groceries are especially if you don’t previously cook at home😉 .
