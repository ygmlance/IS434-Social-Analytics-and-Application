For tonight’s dinner, I underestimated the garlic fried rice portion - imagine my horror when I realized I prepped for 2 portions only. 🤯 Staying home can be so baffling these days. With some not-so-quick thinking, I decided to use the hot dog buns I bought yesterday to make beef sandwich. So everyone can make their dinner choice tonight. 👏🏻 but this is the thiiiiiinest ribeye I’ve ever purchased and its from an online store. 😅 anyone has a good beef steak online shop to recommended me? 😉
