Hello everyone, I'm doing a little shoutout here. I've been seeing so many impressive #homecook posts since the start of the the #circuitbreakersg period. How about supporting a cause? Take a photo of not only the end product, but some cooking moments and hashtag #StayHomeWithAscott on instagram. From now till 4 May, Capitaland Hope Foundation will donate US$10 for every eligible post. The donation will go towards global food security programs for children impacted by covid-19. With that, I've set up a new public instagram account @simletseat featuring my humble cooking for my kids. Let's continue to cook/bake/brew away and enjoy these bonding moments! #stayhomewithascott #myfamilytale #homemadefood #sghomecook #toddlerfood #lobstertail #lobsterlaksa #stayhomestaysafe #circuitbreakersg
