Boom beguiles most with this look and he will not be so little for long
.
Reflecting tonight that this is a very tough season. Isolation is challenging for families with kids, the younger ones are bouncing off the walls with their abundant energy
.
Wonder what is God’s purpose for this pandemic that brought the world to its knees in my lifetime
.
While my physical presence is in the home, my being remains with work for the workday
.
I’m guilty of shoo-ing them off during the workday and in their limited expression, they are starting not to enjoy this season much
.
Overheard them lamenting to each other that hbl isn’t fun as hopes of chatting together as a family were dashed and quite often recently, they wish they were back in school
.
Boom felt that there were no instructions at home unlike school, possibly hinting that he wasn’t guided or he missed the daily routine
.
These coming from them, stem from unmet expectations and disappointments
.
Life has to go on. I, we can do better tomorrow
