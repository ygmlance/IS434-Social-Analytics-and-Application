Dinner is a mixture of homecooked food and food delivery. We have 2 homecooked egg dishes (sunny side up and onion omelette) and 2 delivered egg dishes (white carrot cake and fried oyster omelette)... wow! Also have fried fish, black bean fish, chinese spinach and fishball soup, plus we ordered satay too. Oh, what a feast! 😱 And we finished everything!

That aluminium foil 真的是抢镜头!
