$2 cha-shu rice from @takagiramen !! (2 piece of finely sliced Cha-Shu with generous sweet teriyaki (?) sauce (idk what sauce is that but it’s sweet, duh bruh) & the kewpie Japanese mayo wew (not a fan of mayo but not to this mayo!!). Some spring onions for garnish and a fud-load of rice ( its to keep us full I guess). Brought my own container to do my part towards a more sustainable and green environment uwu. Though the ingredients were simple and not much but at times like this, I really appreciate their heart to make things more affordable to the common citizens and lend a helping hand to those in need, who’s main purpose is to fill their belly. It is very heartwarming to see the kitchen staffs working their guts off in the small kitchen, churning out the promotion orders on top of their original priced items. Thank you Kitchen Heros.❤️ Let’s continue supporting each other in such pressing times.
