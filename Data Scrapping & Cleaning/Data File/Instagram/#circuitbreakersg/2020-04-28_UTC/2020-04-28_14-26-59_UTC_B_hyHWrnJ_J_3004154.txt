Can't even remember which wfh week this is - it's quite difficult to track the days when the boundaries for life/work/personal space etc are so blurred. I found myself spending too much of my time struggling to mark the boundaries and keep to them.

It's also a season where I find that God is challenging me to return to the super basics and fundamentals - without meetings to attend, physical meet-ups, the ability to do my Sunday afternoons out in a cafe and even the ability to travel to work. Without all these things that I had relied on to keep my emotional tank and spiritual life going, what do I have left without them?

The need to be even more disciplined. The question about whether God is more important to me than the many distractions (yes netflix omg) at home. The challenge to reconstruct new habits and routines.

Who will I be and what I will be left, after the end of this season? If there is a purpose in pain (not just from a previous season but also the pain of lol being stuck at home), if there is a purpose in this season that God allowed to happen, I hope I learn the right lessons and make the right decisions.Â Perhaps this circuit breaker period is God's way of knocking at my heart to do some serious rebooting, so that I can be prepared for what He intends in the next season.

P.S. thankful that I'm one of the last few folks I knew who actually travelled this year. Small thing, but it was such an important getaway for me and I'm grateful that God allowed me to do that.
