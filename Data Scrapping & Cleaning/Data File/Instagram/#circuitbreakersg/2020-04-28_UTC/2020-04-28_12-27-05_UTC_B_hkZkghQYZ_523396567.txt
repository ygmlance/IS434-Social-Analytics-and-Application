Do Not Wait, The Time will Never be “Just Right”, The Time is Now❗️⠀
⠀
I was flipping through the pages of the newspaper the other day and I stopped at one page. There it was. I saw it. ⠀
⠀
My face. ⠀
⠀
We all have this idea that if you make it into the papers, you’ve made it. Alhamdulillah, I’m just really thankful for everything.. 🙏🏼⠀
⠀
It is a moment of reflection for me, to get to where I am now. How did I do it? What was my driving factor? Have I done my best? How could I have done better? And where do I go from here? ⠀
⠀
One thing I know for sure is, to keep moving forward and being the best version of me, one day at a time. ⠀
⠀
Thank you to all who have been a part of my journey ❤️⠀

Stay safe, stay healthy and stay home everybody 🙆🏻‍♂️⠀
