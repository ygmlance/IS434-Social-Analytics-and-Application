Next up in our online series is a Pop Music Arranging workshop with Music Director, Arranger and Keyboardist Goh Si Kai!
.
This Pop music arranging workshop will cover important fundamentals of arrangement by “dissecting” familiar Pop songs and showing participants how it is created, all on GarageBand!
.
Topics include:
- The "arrangement pyramid",
- Dynamics : Orchestration density and harmonic density,
- Structure: Form and sections, the song flow and transitions,
- Basic rhythmic patterns and beats
- Introduction to mixing and putting it altogether ... and lots more!
.
*To really benefit from this workshop, you would need to have an understanding of chords and harmony. You do NOT need to have GarageBand/midi keyboard set up, but if you would like to try as u follow along, you’re most welcome to! .

Pop Music Arranging workshop (live via Zoom):
1 - 2 May (Fri - Sat), 4-6pm
$36, $32 (SOMA students/alumni)
