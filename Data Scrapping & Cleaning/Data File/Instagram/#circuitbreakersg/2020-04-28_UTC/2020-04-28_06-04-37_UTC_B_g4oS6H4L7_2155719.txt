I’m serving Dhal Curry with Roti Prata for lunch. 印度煎饼.
Tried flipping the roti prata dough a few times but not up to my desired texture so I quickly used the store bought frozen prata instead. 
Dhal curry is a straight forward recipe. You need to constantly stirring the soaked dhal and some spices. Dhal curry is a very mild and nutritious curry made up mainly of chana dhal, tomatoes, dried chilli, and spices. Pairing roti prata with dhal curry is a perfect match🤗.
