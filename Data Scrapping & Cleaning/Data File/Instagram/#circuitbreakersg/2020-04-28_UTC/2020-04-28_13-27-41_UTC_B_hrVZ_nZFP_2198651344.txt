[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Wish you could smell the butter and almond aromas when my Prune Muffins/ Cake just came out from my airfryer!😍
.
Was inspired by @The.Italian.Hob's fresh pear cake, so here's my version. I like how this recipe uses almond flour and it came in really handy as my (normal) flour supply is now running low. Have been checking out my supermarket's baking section for the last few weeks, but flour and yeast have run out. It's crazy. No prizes for guessing what everyone's doing at home during this period. 🤣 Swipe ⬅️ for more pics.
