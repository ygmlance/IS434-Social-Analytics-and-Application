When Ah Hui decided to give up her position in an international bank to become a hawker, she turned heads. Now, she is turning heads once again with her delicious Chee Cheong Fun.

We conducted a WhatsApp interview with and here‚Äôs what she has to say:

Born in KL, Ah Hui (now a Singapore PR) came to Singapore 10 years ago. After working in an international bank for years, she got tired of the mundane office routine and decided to quit her job to chase her dreams. Backpacking and running her own food business. She did both, opening Chee Cheong Fun Club in 2017. 
When asked why Chee Cheong Fun? Ah Hui said, it‚Äôs because Chee Cheong Fun is her comfort food. The Chee Cheong Fun sold here however just doesn‚Äôt have the same taste or texture as the ones sold back in her hometown. This is is what makes Chee Cheong Fun Club so special. Besides the fact that the Chee Cheong Fun is made from a special home recipe, Ah Hui is dedicated to recreating the taste of childhood and home for her patrons. Some examples of the unique flavours offered would be the Classic Black Sauce, Traditional Red Sauce, Sesame Peanut Sauce (inspired by taste of HK), Curry CCF (Malaysia), Laksa CCF (Singapore Nyonya Laksa) etc. 
When asked how business has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, Ah Hui said as Maxwell Food Centre is located near the downtown area, traffic to the food centre are predominantly from tourist and offices nearby. Since measures were put in place in January to restrict the entry of tourists from China, there has been a 40-50% in business. As work from home measures gradually became compulsory, there was a further dip in business. 
Fortunately, we do have some regular customers and we‚Äôre really grateful for their support during these times. We‚Äôve also started a collaboration with one of our regular customers to offer islandwide delivery. The take up rate for this has been really good so far! We‚Äôve also seen some return customers from this initiative ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèº
