DAY 22 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
SOGO PUDDING WITH MANGO

Easy peasy dessert. It actually comes with a guarantee from me, that your family, friends or guests, WILL LOVE IT 😉😂 You just need to plan it, because it needs enough soaking time and cooling time. Other than that, a dessert cant get easier than this.

All u need is ....
🔸️ sago (sabudana) - 1/2 cup, soaked in water overnight, or at least 4 hours
🔸️ milk - 2 cups
🔸️ condensed milk (sweetened) - 1/4 cup Or maybe less or more depending on how sweet you want the dessert to be.
🔸️ fruit of your choice - choose sweet ones. Even if you choose citrus, make sure they are not too sour, because sour does not go well with a milk based dessert.

Drain the water from the sago. Add milk and bring to a boil. Use a heavy bottomed pan. Simmer for 2-3 min, stir a few times. Add the condensed milk. Mix well. Turn off the heat and allow it to cool. 
It becomes thicker as it cools as the sago continues to absorb milk. Allow it to cool to room temperature. Put in the fridge. Add fruits of your choice once the dessert is cold. 🔸️ If it looks too thick when you take it out of the fridge, just add a few spoons of cold milk and stir well. It has to be thick, but flowing, not lumpy. 🔸️ Mix the fruit only after refrigerating the dessert. 🔸️ Fresh fruit is always better. But if not available, just use a can of fruit cocktail. Drain the liquid and mix with the cooled sago.
