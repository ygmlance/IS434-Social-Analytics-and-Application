üçúHave you attempted your own ramen at home? We tried too and made quite a decent oneü•∞ Decent enough for us to wipe out the noodles and clean the bowl of its broth üôà‚Å£
‚Å£
Ingredients for Ramen Broth:‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ù§Ô∏è2-3 cups prawn/pork broth ( I cooked prawn shells/head, garlic and pork bones in a slow cooker for 8-10 hours) and then strained to get the broth‚Å£

‚ù§Ô∏è1 yellow onion, chopped into fine pieces‚Å£

‚ù§Ô∏è1 tbsp cornflour with 2 tbsp water‚Å£
‚Å£
Steps:‚Å£
