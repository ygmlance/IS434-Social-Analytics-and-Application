Physiotherapy is reclassified back to the list of essential services! ✌🏼
.
HOWEVER, there's still a very stringent list of criteria we have to adhere to for face-to-face (FTF) rehab sessions. This is only for a crucial group of patients who meet the criteria, and whose condition would deteriorate significantly without FTF session over the circuit breaker period. We would hence have to review on a case-by-case basis.
.
As much as we really really want to have you back at the clinic, priority will still be via Tele-consult sessions. We hope this clarifies most enquries, but do call/email in if you've further questions!
.
We are 22 days into the circuit breaker! & we really appreciate everyone's understanding and encouragement during this period of time.
.
WE CAN DO THIS 💪🏼!
