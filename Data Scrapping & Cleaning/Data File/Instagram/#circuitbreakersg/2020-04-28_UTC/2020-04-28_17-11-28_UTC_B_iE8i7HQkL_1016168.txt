#Circuitbreakersg day 22

Saw some spam don post on insta a week ago & i couldn’t get it out of my head. Yes, I have a weakness for spam and luncheon meat. 
For the rest of them, a healthier version with leftover pork belly. From the army stew yesterday.
&... Gave it a more “atas” feel with a sprinkle of ebikko. 
Dinner was : 🔺Don bowl with leftovers 😀
Long beans crabsticks omelette 
Teriyaki pork belly with onions 
Balance diet right? ~
