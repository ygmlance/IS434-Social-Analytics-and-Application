It's circuit breaker day 21, and it ain't stopping me from making delicious food for the whole family from scratch! 
Watched a live stream lesson yesterday and learnt to make these 2 items ~ yakisoba bread & mojito! And a special request from the lil one to have both teriyaki chicken & egg mayo in the same bunðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ #igsg #igfoodies #sgmums #sgkid #sgparents #stayhomewithascott #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #homebakersg #homemadebread #japanesefood
