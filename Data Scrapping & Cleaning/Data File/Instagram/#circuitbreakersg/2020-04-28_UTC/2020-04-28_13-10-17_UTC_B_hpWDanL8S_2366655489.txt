So happy that we can still enjoy great food while weâ€™re staying home. And Iâ€™m using this time to discover new places that I havenâ€™t tried before like @brine.singapore ðŸ˜‹ Perhaps I should have re-plated to do the food justice... yummy nonetheless! We enjoyed the truffle capellini, ribeye with duck fat potatoes and duck with kimchi fried rice. -S
