Day 25

Having absorbed the news about another 4 weeks of sheltering at home, I found myself filled with a multitude of conflicting emotions and reactions. It took awhile to unpack. I am still working through what all of this means to me. The best way I know to work through my emotions is to journal.

I recently received a handwritten note from my life coach, who was very kind to offer words of encouragement at this time. I was touched by the care and attention offered through a handwritten note.

If you are having a lot to process, write. If you need to make a connection sincerely and heartfully, write.

Handwriting is, according to AR Luria, "a multilayered, dynamic, kinesthetic memory", Writing by hand improves cognitive memory alongside muscle coordination. Sequential writing movements can activate large regions of the brain responsible for thinking, language, healing and working memory. Studies show that more ideas are expressed when written by hand.

Today's suggestion is to handwrite (not type) out a page of anything - stream of consciousness, a letter to a friend in need of support, a thank you note, or record a recipe.

Take the time to mindfully write down some thoughts, or even ideas on what to do when social distancing tapers off. Handwriting also helps you engage your ideas with creative expression, and can lead to inspired alternatives.

Handwriting is also a profound tool for discovering the thoughts and voices that you may not be aware of, lurking under your daily busyness.

If you are still drawing a blank, than write "I love you" on a note, and give it to someone who needs it. This includes yourself.
