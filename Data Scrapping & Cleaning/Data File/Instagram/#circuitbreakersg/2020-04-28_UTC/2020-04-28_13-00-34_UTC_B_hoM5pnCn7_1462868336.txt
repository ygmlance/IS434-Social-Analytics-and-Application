A chef from #TeamBRCKTS makes an appearance! This time, it’s @melyzy with her banana pancakes. It’s good that everyone is still treating themselves with snacks they love during their well-deserved weekend break. Paired with a cup of coffee, she’s ready to pamper her tummy and mind, making the most out of her weekends.

“This stay-home season means putting my inner Cooking Mama to work! Or lack thereof, judging from my deconstructed banana pancakes. Nonetheless, it still tasted great and I can’t wait to experiment with other recipes!”
