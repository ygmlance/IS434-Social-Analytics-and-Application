Looking forward to food all the time w @mannapotcatering 🥰 their grain bowls are super yummy & fuss free! 🤤
Since the circuit breaker started, my husbands and I fav question to each other is “ what do u want to eat” haha. Collaborating with @mannapotcatering made decisions so much easier since they’ve got subscription plans for all ( singles, couples & family) this is my 3rd week working with them and I can confidently say we’re hooked ♥️ Week 3 meal plan for Tuesday :
Beef bulgogi bimbimbap & Mediterranean tuna pasta
