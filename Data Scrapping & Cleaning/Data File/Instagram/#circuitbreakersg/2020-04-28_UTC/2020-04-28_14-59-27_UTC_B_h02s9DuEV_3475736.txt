Day 22 of circuit breaker, just his regular story book time. This is one of his favourite books, we bought it since he was 8 months old. He will reads it almost everyday, asking me what is the animals and vehicles. So decided to test him on the animals and was shock to know he knows every of them. I usually talk to him in english, his daddy talk to him in mix english and chinese and grandma talk in chinese, so now he talk in mix languages. Can you guess what he say? #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #hbl #homebasedlearning #storyreading #littlereader #booklover #bilingual #wfh #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #hshtuez
