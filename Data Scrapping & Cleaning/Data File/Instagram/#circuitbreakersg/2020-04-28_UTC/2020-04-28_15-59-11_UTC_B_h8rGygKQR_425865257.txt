This time, an orange blossom and grapefruit peel fougasse. Thank you @hubersbutchery, youâ€™re the best find this lockdown! They actually stock my orange blossom water ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³.

Folded with yeast, light muscovado sugar, all purpose flour, olive oil and sel gris. Accompanied with culatelloâ€” this is the kinda bread you need to tear apart with your hands like a savage, douse with olive oil and then pop rolls of delicate culatello into your mouth. Alongside the driest champagne you can find.
