STAY SAFE and HAVE YOUR LITTLE PARTY with people who matter the MOST ❤️
.
We are adopting the #newnormal slowly but surely and food is proving to be such a great help in doing so 😇😘 Am trying out many new recipes and Ashish is trying to create restaurant like ambiance at home - sometimes we sit n eat in cozy area, sometimes in dining area and sometimes sofa and chair setup like this ... .
.
Here we are relishing Swensen’s iconic, Earthquake In A Box - 8 scoops of amazing flavors of Ice-cream and 10 different types of toppings! .
🚚🚚 This and more new treats are now available for delivery via @deliveroo_sg upto 30th April and after that on @grabfoodsg and @foodpandasg too. 🚚🚚
