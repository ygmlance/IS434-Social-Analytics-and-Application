Japanese curry with scallops, sliced pork and broccoli stir fry.

Spiced things up with a side of Japanese curry. Replaced the the usual white rice with loads of broccoli and carrots making it lower in carbs but higher in 口感(mouth feel). The crunch from the vegetables coated with the velvety curry combined with the tenderness of the pork. I’ll say it’s a perfect bite.
