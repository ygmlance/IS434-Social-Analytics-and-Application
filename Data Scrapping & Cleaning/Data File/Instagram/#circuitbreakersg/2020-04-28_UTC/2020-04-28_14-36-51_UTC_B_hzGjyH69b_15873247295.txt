I learnt about this dish from watching Crayon Shin Chan. 
In original recipe, chicken thigh or salmon are included. 
I replaced them by adding more mushroom and Edamame for protein source. 
Ingredient: 
2 cups of rice
360ml of Kombu Dashi
15ml mirin 
15ml soy sauce
half carrot 
100g Edamame 
tofu puff 4 small piece
1 pack shimeiji mushroom
7 pieces shiitake mushroom
Garlic (optional)

Steps :
1. Wash the rice
2. Add in dashi, soy sauce and mirin
3. Add all the remaining ingredients except garlic
4. Spread them evenly over the rice
5. Close the lid and turn the pressure regulator knob to "PRESSURE"
6. Select "RICE" and cook for 10 minutes. 
7. Release pressure by turning the knob to "steam" and open the lid
8. Mix the rice thoroughly
