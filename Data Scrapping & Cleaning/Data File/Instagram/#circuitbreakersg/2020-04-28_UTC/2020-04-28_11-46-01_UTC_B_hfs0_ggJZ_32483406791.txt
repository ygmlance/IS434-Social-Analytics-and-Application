Wine salt is a gourmet salt that goes well with high quality meat that is pan seared or fried, stone seared, grilled or even roasted.

For me, I made this salt to be paired with A5 wagyu beef that is seared on hot stone. On its own, it might be too salty for anyone to taste anything. That’s why it’s best served with high quality meat to get the best out of this salt.

I pound the wine salt into a finer texture, so that the salt covers the meat easily when you dip in it.

It also allows the flavour spreads well in your mouth as you take a bite of that marvellous steak.
