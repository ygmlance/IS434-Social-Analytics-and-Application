👩‍🍳MUNCH AT HOME👩‍🍳
With the circuit breaker, we can’t just run out and get cake that easily😔We don’t bake often but decide to make one of our favourite cakes - simple and delicious banana cake topped with a hojicha spread twirl!💫It’s not perfect but the banana cake was still quite light and fluffy and the roasted taste of hojicha really added a nice touch🥳
