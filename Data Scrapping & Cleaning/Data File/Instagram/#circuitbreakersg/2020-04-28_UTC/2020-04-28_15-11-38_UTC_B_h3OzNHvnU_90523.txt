🏠 Day 22 / 56 (circuit breaker days)
.
🍃 APRIL READ // Everyone focused so much on LKY, that reading about GCT, our second Prime Minister - felt quite refreshing cos honestly, I don’t quite know much about him or his leadership even though I grew up during his PM days.
.
Fun fact: While LKY gave SG the foundations and strength as a young nation, GCT set in place wheels of motion like GRCs, NMPs and MediSave to name a few to keep it going.
.
Everyone should read this really, just to get a sense of history.
