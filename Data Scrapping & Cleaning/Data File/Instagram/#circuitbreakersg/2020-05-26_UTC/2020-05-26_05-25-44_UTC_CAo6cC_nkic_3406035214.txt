This was my 2nd attempt at making bagels and these babies are 😍. I chose a different recipe this time and I prob failed the first time because of the kneading at the dough. This time I kneaded completely by hand (the first attempt was using a handmixer with dough hooks which didn’t prove to be much cause the dough was a dry and tacky one). Nevetheless, I’m gonna be baking these babies again cause they are so easy and fun, and 🤤. I also used AP flour as opposed to bread flour in the recipes, turns out chewy and nice, probably less dense than the usual bagels but that’s okay with me 🥯❤️
