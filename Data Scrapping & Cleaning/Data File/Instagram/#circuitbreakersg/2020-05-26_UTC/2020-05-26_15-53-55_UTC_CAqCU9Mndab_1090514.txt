My Aunty Molly cooked Beef Stew with Guinness (whoo, alcohol!) for us when she came to our house and stayed with us while visiting from Sydney. I was a little girl then but it left a lasting impression. Managed to get some good beef chucks so I decided Iâ€™ll try making something similar today, with Guinness, of course. I wonder if you remember this @Lt.jellibean @emimajay ?
