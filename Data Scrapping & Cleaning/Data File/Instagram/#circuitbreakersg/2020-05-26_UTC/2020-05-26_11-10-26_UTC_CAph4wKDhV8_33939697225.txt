~ Savoury Pancakes ~ We had some leftover pancakes. So I made a pot of japanese curry to pair with it, like how we eat prata (south east asian pancakes). It's a very refreshing take with a good mix of sweet and savoury taste. The Simlets enjoyed it. :) #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecooking #healthykidsfood #creativekidsfood #instafood #fusionfood #pancakes #japanesecurry #japanesefood #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
