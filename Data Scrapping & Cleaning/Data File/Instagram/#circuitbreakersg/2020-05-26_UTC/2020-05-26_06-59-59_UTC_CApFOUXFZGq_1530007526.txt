üçúüçõDAY 50 CB!!! Can you believe it that we made it through 50 days of homemade and dabao meals?! I sure as heck still can't fathom how I managed to cook all sorts of dishes I was craving for and washing up as well for the last 7 weeks but yup, it kind of just happened. üò±

Nothing fancy for today's lunch, just a packet of instant noodles with luncheon meat and a fried egg. But for me, it's the subtle differences like boiling your noodles first and running them under cool water to create a better bite that elevates the simple to shiok. Someone once told me that it's better to not cook the noodles together with the soup because you're also ingesting the layer of wax coating when you do that. So by applying the method of how meepok hawkers always cook their noodles in boiling water first before plunging it into cool water, this is the same logic and you actually get springier noodles!
