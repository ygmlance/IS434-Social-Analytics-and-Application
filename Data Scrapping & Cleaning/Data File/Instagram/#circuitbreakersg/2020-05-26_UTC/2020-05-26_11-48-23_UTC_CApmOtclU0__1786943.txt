Made some pancakes topped with some whipped cream (wanted to clear the remaining at that point of time so we ended up with just a tiny blob of whipped cream at the top)⁣

Drizzled with maple syrup because it's a must for pancakes!! Figs was something I saw quite often in Korea cafes so it was nice to try and recreate that aesthetic hehe!
