So the kiasu mommy who also wanted to walk off her lunch went out to self-collect the mask for the family including bbc using the vending machine at Woodlands CC.

It is so convenient and the kids mask looks so nice. I like pink and I can't lie. ðŸ˜‚ I'm so excited that I didn't just take photos of the mask but also the measurements. 
Aside, really appreciate the government for giving out free masks and also making it so convenient to collect.
