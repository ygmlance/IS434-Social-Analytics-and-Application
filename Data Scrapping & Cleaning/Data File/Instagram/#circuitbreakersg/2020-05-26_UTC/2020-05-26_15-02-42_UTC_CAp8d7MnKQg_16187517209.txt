Not many countries celebrating Hari Raya. In fact for the first time this year, due to circuit breaker (in SG), we all stay home, so our Muslim friends are not allow to visit mosque, families and friends... All prayers to the resolution of Covid-19 situation. My thought goes to them, please stay safe and stay strong my friends💪🏼🙏🏼 .
