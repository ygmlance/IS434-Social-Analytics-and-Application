@osteopathichealthcare is one week from re-opening on Tuesday 2 June to assist our patients with a body tune-up!
In the meantime, our osteopath David Farrelly @paddlingosteo.singapore will demonstrate a very simple back stretch to assist with lower back aches and stiffness.
Lower Back Stretch

‚Ä¢ Keep one leg straight and raise the opposite knee to your chest
‚Ä¢ Using both hands hold the lower leg to gently pull the knee towards your chest
‚Ä¢ Hold the stretch for 15 seconds
‚Ä¢ Repeat 4 times on each side
