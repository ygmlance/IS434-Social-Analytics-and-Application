With our new #wfh reality (@google just announced we'd be wfh till 2021) I've had to rethink my strategy around creating easy lunches for us to eat. I want to avoid spending $30 on takeout each time and am exploring some ways to achieve this.
.
Today's lunch is a healthy meal created in less than 10 mins, consumed in 20 mins and I am off to my next meeting ðŸ˜‚
.
Roasted chicken is store-bought and already roasted whole, I simply hand shred it the moment I buy it and tuck it away in the fridge for future meals like this, or in omelettes, noodles, porridges.
.
The salad in this wrap provides ALL THE FLAVOUR and is simply dressed with olive oil, crushed garlic, capers and black pepper. Add it to any combi of veggies to seriously level it up ðŸ¤¤
