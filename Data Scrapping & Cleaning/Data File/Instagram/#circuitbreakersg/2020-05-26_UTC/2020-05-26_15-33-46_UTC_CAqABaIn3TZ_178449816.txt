Day 50 of #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wah Lao, we have endured 50 days of CB!! Time to mark this occasion, by cooking something different!
.
Ok actually it’s just a coincidence that I cooked fried rice. This is yet another dish I’d been avoiding simply because I feel that it’s just not going to taste even near to what the restaurants can do. I recall years ago I tried once. Involved lots of oil and the rice stuck to the pan etc. And all I got was a plateful of oil tasting rice. Why bother.
.
But because somebody kept bugging for fried rice (the husband to be exact) decided to give it a go again. Didn’t bother to follow any recipe but I kept 2 things in mind. HIGH HEAT, and every grain of rice must be coated in egg.
.
Well here’s my version. I have to say I’m pretty pleased w the results. It actually tastes like fried rice, but less seasoned. And I didn’t even have to use overnight rice.
.
Here’s what I did for 3 person portion. It’s nice but don’t expect DTF standard ok. For one I used basmati, which isn’t the same already. 
1. Sauté a truckload of garlic and set aside 
2. Two tablespoons of oil in a piping hot pan, pour in 1.5 person portion of rice. Toss toss toss. 
3. Make a well in the rice. Add in 1.5 beaten egg with 1 tsp soya sauce. Wait for bottom of egg to solidify slightly. 
4. Fold in the rice onto the top of the egg and toss toss toss again. 
5. Add back half the garlic and toss some more until you are happy w the results. 
6. Repeat again with remaining half of rice. 
7. I cooked the meat and veg separately and added in at the end.
.
Quite keen to try my hand at fried rice again sometime soon.
