Just another day for you and me in paradise. #Day122 inside .

It only took 121 days but yesterday my kids started playing make believe together. They built THEIR OWN fort and played in it for over an hour. Only popping out to fill me in on the story before running away again to play. Not one argument. And this morning the fort was rebuilt and they’ve been playing puppies under there for 90 min. I’m in shock as this is the longest calm stretch we may have ever had in over six years. The two of them bonding may be the best thing to come out of all of this. Normally I’m the one hiding in a fort. And by fort I mean laundry room. .
