Ah Ma Yam Cake (Orh Kueh) for our tea break this afternoon. Each mouthful of this delicious steam yam cake is filled with the goodness of generous yam and mushroom! 😍😋 (1st/2nd photo after re-plating.)
.

This popular traditional dish always brings back fond memories of my Ah Ma (maternal grandma) who could make really good steam cake and her version had dried shrimps and Chinese sausage (lup cheong). .

If you are craving for some good homemade steam yam cake, I highly recommend you to try Ah Ma Yam Cake which is a secret recipe passed down from many generations using only the freshest ingredients with no preservatives!.
