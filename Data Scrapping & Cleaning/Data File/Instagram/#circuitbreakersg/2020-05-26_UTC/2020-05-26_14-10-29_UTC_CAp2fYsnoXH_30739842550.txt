Hey guess what? It’s one more week till the end of circuit breaker! Soon you’ll be able to show off all your fancy bread baking skills to your parents. 
Just top it off with a trio of chopped tomatoes, some awesome french butter and of course, simple yet decadent Ibérico Jamón!

Pssst... a new batch will be dropping in another week or two. Drop us a DM if you want to reserve. Details in the highlights as usual. 🤫
