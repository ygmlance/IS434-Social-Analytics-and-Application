Stay Chill | Often I hear from our regular customers why they always choose shopping with us is mainly because they can have peace of mind in terms of our reasonable pricing and high standard of QC. This warms my heart and keeps pushing me to do what’s right 💕.
.
This comes with a price. Talk about quality, I’m one person who has high expectations so each shipment would go through thorough QC upon arrival. The extra manpower and time to check through all pieces and the effort to list each defect down with supporting photo/video. Then submit the list and photos / videos to respective brand for claim. We would then enter into a negotiation process with the brand manager about claim of each product that’s defective. This process to me is the most hated part of my job and many times I find it a total waste of time. I would really be quite upset when I would grumble “seriously? Why this quality for that high price?”.
.
And this is not all... we don’t throw those products that are only with slight defect cos it’s not environmentally friendly. We keep them till we have open house event where our customers could come in to pick up some super bargains. But this becomes an issue: space... .

All in all, just really hope the brands can be more responsible in their QC so we have lesser work to do & lesser headache. .

Enough of grumbling 😅 continue to work hard and carry on bringing gorgeous stuff 💪🏻❤️
