- Day 50 CB - Finally Reached 50th day of Circuit Breaker Lockdown. Learned lots of things in this 50days, started my workouts eating healthy, reduced the number of sticks I smoke, learned a new skill playing piano still in the beginning stage but have confidence that I will master it, painted my house all alone was actually tiring but fun...So far in this 50days this CB Lockdown did good things to me 😃❤💪

அனைவருக்கும் இனிய காலை வணக்கம் 🙏😊❤

Good Morning Everyone 😊❤
