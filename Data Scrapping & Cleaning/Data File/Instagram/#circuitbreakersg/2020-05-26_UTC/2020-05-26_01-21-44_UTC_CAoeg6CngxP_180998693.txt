W7 of #circuitbreakersg and we are so done. Unfortunately Zeke has been quite emotional this week, feeling cooped up. He wants to "go" all the time, but we can't. On a better note, he got his hair cut by daddy, was really immersed in pretend play and we had 🍕 night again. We can't wait to visit Ah Ma and Gou Gou.
