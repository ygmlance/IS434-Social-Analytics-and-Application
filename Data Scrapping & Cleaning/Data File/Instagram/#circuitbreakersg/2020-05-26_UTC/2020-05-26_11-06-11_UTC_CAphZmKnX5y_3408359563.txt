Day 50 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (26 May 2020) - #nofilter #easypeasy #dinnerforone #friedbeehoon using #cannedfood #stewedpork  to make a #simpledinner with humble ingredients, including #leftover peppers from Day 46 and the last of the chicken stock from Day 45's chicken (really nothing left from that $4.90 chicken anymore, that's 6 meals that it contributed to; 7 if counting the portion of this dish that I saved for breakfast tomorrow. I've tried being vegetarian but failed; am always glad when I consciously make full use of any meat ingredient and waste little or nothing, which is the least I can do to). #stayhomestaysafe #homecooking
