Grilled Unagi Don from Man Man for Tuesday Luncheon today. Great way to kick start the busy work week after a long Raya weekend!

Each live Eel is Charcoal Grilled, followed by a good coat of their secret hand made gravy. Then flame broiled again to lock the flavours. Definately done in a drier style but the taste of that special gravy is pretty well infused within the Unagi.
