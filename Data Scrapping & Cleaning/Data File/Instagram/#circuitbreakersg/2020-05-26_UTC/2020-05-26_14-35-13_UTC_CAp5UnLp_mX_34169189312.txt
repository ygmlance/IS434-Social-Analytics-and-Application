Tomato rice 🍅🍚
One of our go-to rice cooker meals on lazy days 😌 We fell in love with this dish since the first time we tried couple years back.
.
Simply cut any vegetables you like into bite-size - for this we added cabbage, french beans, baby spinach, tofu, chilli padi and of course, tomatoes! 🌱🥬🌶🍅 Rinse off the rice and add in all veggies into the rice cooker. Season with light soya sauce, vegetarian oyster sauce, sesame oil, salt and pepper. Press “on” and leave it to cook! Once it’s done, give it a good stir and it’s ready to serve!😋
.
Tip: Add in leafy greens after ~15mins if you like your veggies crunchy! 🌱🙌🏻
