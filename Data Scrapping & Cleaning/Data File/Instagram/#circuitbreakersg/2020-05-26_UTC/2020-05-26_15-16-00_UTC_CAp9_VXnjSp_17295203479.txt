So school is going to start shortly. Are you prepared?

This is my check list as we start up our engines. 
1. Do the uniforms, socks and shoes fit?
2. Are there enough masks?
3. Have we labeled the masks?
4. Have we packed hand sanitizer?
5. Identification card / appropriate apps downloaded for handphone?
6. Pencil case filled?
7. Holiday homework done and packed?
8. Chat about how they feel about it.

I’m considering putting a scanned copy of the bus pass somewhere in the bag as a back up. Along with a ziplock for the back up masks.

While I’m a bit anxious about school reopening, I’m excited to finally be able to get things done without interruption. What about you?
