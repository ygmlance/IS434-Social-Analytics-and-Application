• Cloudy with a 100% chance of failure •

I have been reading @ruthchousimons book, Becoming and Beholding. Apart from being absolutely gorgeous on the outside, the pages are overflowing with gems of insight, so very valuable for a reflective life! I was inspired to letter this phrase as a reminder to self after reading chapter 8: In Praise of Failure.

I won’t post spoilers here, but I highly recommend making this book a staple part of your personal library if you enjoy Ruth’s insights and writing style (I do, a lot!).
