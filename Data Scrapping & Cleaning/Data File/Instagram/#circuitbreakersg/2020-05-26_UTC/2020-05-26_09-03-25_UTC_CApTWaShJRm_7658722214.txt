Last purchased was 23rd, last Saturday, 5kg of cornflakes. And today, the 26th. 3 days later, we have to make our way again to supermarket just to purchase another 10kg(my arms can't hold it, there's more in the car. Need 2nd trip to pick-up the rest)
.
We have thought of another alternative of purchasing, but its a control item. Online purchase for this item is limited to 8 box, equivalent to 4kg(we need 10kg)
.
This is the only way for us to purchase more of this itemðŸ˜Š
