Thank you for joining today's magic carpet ride thunderstorms on the horizon turbulence expected except we have no seatbelts so hang on tight we are in for an exciting time if you feel dizzy hold your breath and no matter what it is important that you keep your eyes open for the entire journey absolutely paramount that you must remain wide awake. And off we go... #magiccarpetride
