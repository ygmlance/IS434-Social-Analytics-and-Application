Happy Birthday to myself! ðŸ¥°

First time having a birthday through the circuitbreaker. It's really special cos every delivery comes as a surprise. 
You also found out how thoughtful your friends and loved ones are and how sneaky they are to find out your address hahahaha! 
Thank you everyone for your well wishes!
Please stay safe and stay home!
