This year's #HariRaya Assembly at #SJII is different as we take things completely online because of the #pandemic. Still, we continue to wish our Muslim families and friends Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri and we hope you had meaningful celebrations - virtual or not! âœ¨

Thanks to Ms Suad and our students who worked on this video.
