🧀6 CHEESE Chicken Cordon Bleu pizza that will blow your minds away!🧀 We dressed up @shihlinsnacks XXL crispy chicken cutlet to create our very own meal at home❤️⁣⁣

So the chicken formed the “crust” and slowly we topped it with 5 different kinds of cheese (Peppery Jack, Colby Jack, Raclette, grilling cheese, Mozarella, Cheddar) and finally ham! The second pic shows the chicken pizza with @shihlinsnacks sweet plum potato fries and seafood tempura⁣⁣
