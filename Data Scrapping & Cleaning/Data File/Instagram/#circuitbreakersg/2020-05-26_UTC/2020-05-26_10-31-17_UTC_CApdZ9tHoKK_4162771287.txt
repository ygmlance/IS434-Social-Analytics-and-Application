During this period of facing different issues and yet stuck at home because of circuit breaker, the sharing by the various speakers of NCW Women Arise 2020, were awesomely powerful, practical and have helped me to break the battlefield of the mind. .
.
I was particularly touched and near to tears when Pastor Susan said " when we hurt, Jesus hurts. When we wound , Jesus wound." At that instance, I really felt God's Fatherly love and that He is with me. I felt my heart lifted up and God is healing me. It was also a reminder that when people  communicate and act out what they do is because they have shut down heart. .
.
All in all, it points back that we are to be aligned with God and in His presence, to be in partnership with the Holy Spirit as He is the best guide, and the peace and wisdom that HS gives will see us through in joy regardless the circumstances. 
Rest and be assured that God is in control ~ DP
