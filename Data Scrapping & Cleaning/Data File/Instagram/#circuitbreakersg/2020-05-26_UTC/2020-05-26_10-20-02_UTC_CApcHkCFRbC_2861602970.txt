#circuitbreakersg day 50

I really wonder how long circuit breaker will last. Phase 1 is jus circuit breaker extended for me 😞😒 Yay my mum made one of my favourite desserts - Bubur Cha Cha. It’s a Nyona coconut milk dessert, commonly contains sweet potatoes, yam and tapioca jelly. I loveee the tapioca jelly a lot and I usually like to have my bo bo cha cha solely with tapioca jellies only😜 (u can find out in the video at the end, swipe till the end. Pls don’t get triggered 🤣) #jxeatshome #stayhome
