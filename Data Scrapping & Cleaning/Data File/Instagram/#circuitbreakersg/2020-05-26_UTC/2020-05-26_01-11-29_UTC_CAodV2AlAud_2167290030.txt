DAY 49, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
(Countdown .... 7 days to go)
SPINACH CHEESE PIE

Goodmorning Instafam!! A week to freedom. Controlled freedom 😂😂 Paradox; full of contradiction!! Nonetheless, it is freedom.
Vegetarians or Non-vegetarian,  you will love these, because you can put just about any filling in there.
 The credit for this awesome idea goes to @joyful921
Thanks Renee. I finally tried it!! And you are right, they are pretty darn good 👍🏻
Thankyou for sharing your experiment, and spreading the joy (just as your Instaname suggests🤩 - Joyful!!) Pies made with Roti Prata. Just put a stuffing of your choice and bake them in the oven. 
My boys loved it and said that they would not have guessed its roti prata if I hadn't told them. 
I had spinach and ricotta cheese at home, so used that.
