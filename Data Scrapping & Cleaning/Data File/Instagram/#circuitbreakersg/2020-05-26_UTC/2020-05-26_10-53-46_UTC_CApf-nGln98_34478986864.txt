Tonight was a simpler meal and a regular favourite of ours â€” homestyle chinese dishes from @kasohsingapore. We had their famous sliced fish soup, as well as beef fried rice, egg fu yong omelette, and cereal pork. Portions were large and flavorful! Order from their website (they are also on @deliveroo_sg, @grabfoodsg, and @foodpandasg)
