Here's a little tidbit about @foodie_quest ... 🤫
.
I truly never stopped documenting my every meal this whole time ! 😆
.
Call it a force of habit or whatever, food is a big part of me and I want to remember all the meals I had and shared with various people. 😊
.
This means I have a ridiculous backlog of my lunch and dinner everyday. Hahahaha. 😂
.
Together with the Circuit Breaker (lockdown) , I've decided to journal my meals starting from 7th April 2020. 🥰
.
What should I call my hashtag #foodiequestinlockdown or #foodiequestCBmeals ? Hahahahahaha LMK! 😄
