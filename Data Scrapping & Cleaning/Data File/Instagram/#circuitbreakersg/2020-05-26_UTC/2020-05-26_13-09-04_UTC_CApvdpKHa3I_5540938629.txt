No phenomenon in the sky today. Just me with some happy songs and great moment in my run. 🤍Feeling the peace and joy even in times of trouble. There is something about the Lord’s shield for us🙌🏻 thank you Father. #praisethelord #thankyoujesus #jesus #run #blessed #togetherinelectricdreams #cloud #sky #skyphotography #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #lockdown
