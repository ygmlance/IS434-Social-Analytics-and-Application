It is a joy to give just as much as it is to receive. Today we sent a gorgeous bloom box to a dear friend, who inspires and uplifts with her generous spirit. We would also like to thank our family and friends who have been showering us with home-baked goodies, delicious treats and other thoughtful gifts during this challenging Circuit Breaker period. What are some of the gifts youâ€™ve blessed someone with? Everlasting bloom box and video by @anthosandco. #werelishpr #covid_19 #circuitbreakersg #flowersofinstagram
