A simple & comforting bowl of soup that I cook often for the family! My first time adding @liloikanbilis scallop powder to the soup. By itself, the soup is flavourful, but with the scallop powder, it was even more yum!ðŸ˜‹ [English Gourd, Carrot & Pork Rib Soup]
Ingredients:
3 pieces pork rib
1 english gourd
2 small carrots
1 tsp @liloikanbilis scallop powder
1 litre water (1) Blanch pork ribs in boiling water and drain.
(2) Put english gourd, carrot and pork ribs in pot with water.
(3) Bring it to a boil, and let soup simmer on low heat for 1.5 hours.  Add in scallop powder and continue to simmer soup for 1/2 hour. (4) Serve hot & enjoy!ðŸ˜Š #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #sgparent #homecooking #sghomecooks #sginstagfood #liloikanbilis #eatfresh #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday50
