Dining on site is banned under circuit breaker in Singapore. People queued up at a food court for takeaways. One of the owners told me that the business is very poor. He looks forward to people dining on site when the COVID-19 situation becomes better in the future.  #circuitbreakersg #singapore #foodcourt @alfredmwu
