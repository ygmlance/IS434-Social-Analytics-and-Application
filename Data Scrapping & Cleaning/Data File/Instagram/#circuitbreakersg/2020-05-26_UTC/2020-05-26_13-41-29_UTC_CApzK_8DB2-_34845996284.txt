Long bean rice ◎ smart/rice cooker version

You can tell that I really love ‘all-in-one-pot’. Other than yam rice that I shared before, long bean rice is another favorite of mine. The recipe is the same as yam rice but long bean will give you a different flavor. Again, I use smart cooker here but rice cooker is fine.

Ingredients: 
Long bean and cut into 1cm bits
200g 3 layer pork (I bought it from wet market so ask the butcher to do me a favor to cut into stripes)
White button mushrooms cut into slices or cubes (somehow I think long bean and white button mushrooms match really well, so I prefer white button mushroom over dried mushrooms, but you can use any of your favorite)
Chopped shallots and minced garlic

❶ marinate 3 layer pork strips with corn flour, pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt, pinch of salt, 1 tablespoon of soya sauce and a bit of shaoxing cooking wine
❷ Heat up oil in smart cooker and fried shallots until slightly brownish
❸ Add minced garlic and marinated pork. Stir fry until pork is 80% cooked
❹ Add white button mushroom and stir fry for a while. As I wash my mushroom before cooking, the mushroom absorbs water and release out when you cook it. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce. Cook till boiling
❺ Add long bean and stir to mix well
❻ Add rice and mix well
❼ Add water to cover all the rice and ingredients. You may not need much water because of the water release from white button mushroom. Add 1 tablespoon of black soya sauce and soya sauce each. Stir to mix well
❽ Put on rice mode and ready to serve when cooking complete
