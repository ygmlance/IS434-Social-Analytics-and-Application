A drawing is simply a line going for a walk.
- Paul Klee -

Loose and intuitive sketches is usually what I love to do.
I like to randomly warm up with different items and do different drawings of all kinds intuitively. 
It’s a lot of a therapeutic measure for myself and I like how it’s seems like the mind travels as I go. 
I’ve had to process a lot lately and in a way, these help me with it. It’s also the not knowing how the outcome would be like that helps me learn that you can be ok with letting go.

Been having quite a few fruits and vegetables subjects lately in my creative work so here’s some of the few I’ve done over the past couple of weeks just to explore colours and play.

Play and letting go, truly is a big motivation. .
