Have been working “outdoors” to get Vitamin D while zooming. WFH so far has been more work than play, no time to play house or cook home-cooked meals, or bake breads and cakes 🍰 even as when Phase 1 (after the Circuit Breaker ends on 1 June) looms and all our jobs and businesses are at stake. I much prefer my mind moves fast and kept agile rather than dawdle everyday at home 🏠. #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #phase2 #sgunited #sgunited🇸🇬 #agility #activeminds #fortitude #strongmind
