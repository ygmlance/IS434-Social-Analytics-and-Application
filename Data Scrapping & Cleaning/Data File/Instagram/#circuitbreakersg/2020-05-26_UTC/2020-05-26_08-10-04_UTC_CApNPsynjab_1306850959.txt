🍂Happiness is yours in all nature... in fields of wildflowers and silent deep forests, in the mystical mountains, and the song of a distant bird. 🍂 Reminds me of forest bathing. Forest bathing is very popular in Japan and I experienced it once when I was hiking Mt Yamadera near Sendai during a winter trip. It’s very calming, therapeutic and cooling. Looking forward to the opportunity to do it again! This morning, I had cravings for Old Chang Kee’s curry puffs and Bengawansolo’s nine-layers kueh (jiu ceng gao 九层糕). So, I made a quick trip to Northpoint City during lunch time and came back with all my favourite food: Old Chang Lee’s curry puff and sotong ball, Bengawansolo’s jiu ceng gao and egg tart, Dough Culture’s goreng pisang. 😋😍 Do you like any of them? 😬😬 Pairing with camomile tea and my newly bought pink gerbera daisies! Such a sweet bouquet! 🥰I’m so full and satisfied with today’s lunch buffet! 完美！Burppp... 😋😋😋😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
