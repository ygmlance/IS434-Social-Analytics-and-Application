#circuitbreakersg day 50

My favourite kind of meals is the kind where the food is placed in front of me and all I need to do is to eat. ðŸ˜† .

Had a simple and satisfying dinner of #gyudon and saba fish tonight. ðŸ˜‹ .

I work at my dining table so on days when Iâ€™m not in charge of cooking dinner, I just need to move from the left side of the table (my â€˜officeâ€™) to the right side of the table for dinner. ðŸ¤£ And for that Iâ€™m grateful for the time I save in telecommuting. #gratitudediary
