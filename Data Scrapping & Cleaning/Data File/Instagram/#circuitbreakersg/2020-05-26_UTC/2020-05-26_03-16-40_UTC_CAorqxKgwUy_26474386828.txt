6 more days to the end of CB!! Entering to Phase 1 : Safe Re-Opening

Parents working in the essentials businesses will be able to go back to work and selected age group of kids will be heading back to school first and the rest will follow in later date.

House visiting are allowed too!! This is what we are happy about, we miss visiting our grandparents for such a long time (althought it is just 2 months). However, the visits must be kept very small, and only two members of one household are allowed to visit on one day. In other words, you can go with your sibling (living in the same house as you) to visit your grandparents, but not on the same day that your cousins (or any other relatives) are visiting them. 
One sad thing is that F&B dine-in are still a No No and we still have to packed or cooked our own food. 
Lets continue to stay safe and stay home and look forward to move into Phase 2!! #hoggieadventures #howieeats #gracieplays #maxielearns #hedgehog #digitalart #cute #fun #instaart #cartoon #artofinstagram #StayHome #StaySafe #SGUnited #CircuitBreakerSG #EndOfCircuitBreaker #Countdown
