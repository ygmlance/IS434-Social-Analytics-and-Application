Cir Breaker Day 50 Lunch.

Takeaway dry prawn noodles from Penang Delights. Peeled and braised small prawns are added instead of the normal boiled big shell prawns. These little babies pack a punch of umami flavours, just like really intense hae bee aka dried shrimps, but without the saltiness. We also always top up for extra liao, which means braised egg and lor bak from their lor mee ingredients. Their chilli is a must,  mix all together and slurp it up.
