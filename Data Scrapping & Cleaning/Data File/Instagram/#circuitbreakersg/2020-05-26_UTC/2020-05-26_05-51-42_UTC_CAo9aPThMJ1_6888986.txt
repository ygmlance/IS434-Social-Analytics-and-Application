This is how we prep the kids for a walk in the late mornings.

The mandatory masks, a hat, and sun glasses if they want to. Slap on the sunscreen and they're ready for a walk down to the Park Connector and back.

Staying indoors for too long makes them antsy, and research has show that being in the sun makes you feel better.

So we try to get the kids to do some physical activities in the sun, while of course, complying with the Circuit Breaker rules.

What are the outdoor activities that you do with your kids during this not-lockdown lockdown?
