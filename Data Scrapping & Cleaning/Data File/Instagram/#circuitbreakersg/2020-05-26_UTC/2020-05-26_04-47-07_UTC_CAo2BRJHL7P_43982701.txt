Only 6 more days to the end of #circuitbreakersg! Eating healthy today with barramundi and blanched spinach. Barramundi was pan seared skin sided down for the crispy skin then turned over to be braised in a mixture of sake, mirin, soy sauce, sugar and sesame oil. #eathealthy #barramundi #spinach #homecooking #singaporehomecooks #stayhomesg #sgeats #stfoodtrending #sgfood #8dayseat #burpple #f52grams #feedfeed #huffposttaste #foodstagram #healthyfood #buzzfeedfood #thekitchn #seriouseats #foodphotography #beautifulcuisines #heresmyfood #feedfeed #gloobyfood #forkyeah #foodbeast #sghomecooking #bonappetit #foodiegram #foodgasm
