Yesterday was really hot but also really pretty ðŸ˜Š
.
It was probably an 8km cycle from my house. Which isnâ€™t much but itâ€™s impt for me not to overdo it cause of my pain.
.
I have no idea how Iâ€™ll adjust back to normal life after the cb (lockdown) is over cause I really enjoy doing things on my own time. Does anyone have a clue?
