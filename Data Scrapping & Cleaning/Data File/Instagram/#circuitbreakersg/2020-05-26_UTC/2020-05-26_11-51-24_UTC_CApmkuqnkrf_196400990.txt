Dinner this evening, was a Dry Fried Beef Kway Teow, or Gon Chow Ngau Hor in Cantonese. Thin slices of lean beef were marinated in light soya sauce and Shaoxing wine, and stir-fried in the wok till half cooked. Sliced white onions and minced garlic was added, and sweat till fragrant. The Kway Teow, or Flat Rice Noodles where thrown in and seasoned with a swirl of superior light soya sauce. Beaten eggs were added, and when nearly cooked, mixed well with the noodles. Bean Sprouts and Chye Sim, or Mustard Greens were thrown in, along with a splash of water to moisten things up. Superior Dark Soya Sauce was added, and mixed well with the noodles, and it was finished off with a sprinkling of freshly ground white pepper. Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #dryfriedbeefkwayteow #gonchowngauhor #cantonesefood #cantonesecuisine #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
