Iâ€™ve super enjoyed following / having chats with more SG ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ instas during CB. One you should def check out is @sgpnoodles, who is focussed on sharing the food that actual Singaporeans cook and eat, documenting these dishes and preserving them for future generations. I made this eggplant sambal she posted, a recipe from @singaporeliciouz and itâ€™s SO FUCKING DELICIOUS. I substituted in @batulesungspicecompany sambal belacan in for the belacan cause I am just shoving it into everything I can. My FYN tip - make double (maybe quadruple) the sambal paste and then just use it to stir in to everything you fry, I will make it with eggplant, tempeh and green beans next. @sgpnoodles suggests stirring in coconut milk to use it in a curry. Iâ€™m so here for local peeps showing me how to cook their local food - hit me up with any other interesting insta suggestions you may have ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬
