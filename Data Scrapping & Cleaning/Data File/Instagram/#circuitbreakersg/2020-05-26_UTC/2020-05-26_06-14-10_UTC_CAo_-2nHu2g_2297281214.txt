@osteopathichealthcare is one week from re-opening on Tuesday 2 June to assist our patients with a body tune-up!
In the meantime, our osteopath David Farrelly @paddlingosteo.singapore will demonstrate a very simple back stretch to assist with lower back aches and stiffness.
Lower Back Stretch
• Lie down on your back.  You may wish to use a yoga mat for comfort.
• Keep one leg straight and raise the opposite knee to your chest
• Using both hands hold the lower leg to gently pull the knee towards your chest
• Hold the stretch for 15 seconds
• Repeat 4 times on each side
