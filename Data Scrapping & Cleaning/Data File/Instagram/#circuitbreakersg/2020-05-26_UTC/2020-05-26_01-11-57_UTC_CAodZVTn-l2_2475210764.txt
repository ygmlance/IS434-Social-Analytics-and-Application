I love the moment you see the gluten strengthen when you knead by hand. The feel of the shaggy sticky dough changes to soft and supple. As it gets smoother with each knead, itâ€™s rather therapeutic and these are the moments to enjoy during baking adventures. #mrsgansconfectionery #breadmaking #kneadbyhand #soft #gluten #bread #homemade #bakingathome #circuitbreakersg
