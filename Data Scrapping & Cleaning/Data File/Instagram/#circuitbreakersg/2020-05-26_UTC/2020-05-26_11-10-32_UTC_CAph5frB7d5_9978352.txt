Started the first day of work after raya earlier today right with coffee and raya kuihs of course 🤪...
One more week till the circuit breaker gets lifted on the 1st of June which also means that it will be a week more till some (or most) of us go back to physically working from the office. Me included. And to be honest, I’m not exactly looking forward to that. I mean this circuit breaker period has shown us how possible it is to still be productive while working from home. Heck, without the unnecessary distractions, I’ve been more productive at home lah! Hahaha! Who’s with me? 🙋🏻‍♀️ heh heh heh....
.
On a serious note though, I am grateful to still have a job despite these tough times. All of us are affected but at the same time, we are affected differently and are fighting different battles, so please don’t belittle any hardships of others. I pray that we stay strong and in one way or another, are able to help each other along the way. We’ll get back on our feet, like we always do insyaallah ❤️
