The healthcare heroes today work tirelessly to ensure the wellbeing of all Covid-19 patients. Thus, we are indeed grateful for their dedication and admire their hard work round the clock every day

Last week, we had the honour to provide the heroes from Singapore General Hospital a hearty meal to support their commitment towards the call of duty. It truly warms our hearts to see their smiles uplifting the atmosphere all around - which give us the aspiration to provide more to our community.
