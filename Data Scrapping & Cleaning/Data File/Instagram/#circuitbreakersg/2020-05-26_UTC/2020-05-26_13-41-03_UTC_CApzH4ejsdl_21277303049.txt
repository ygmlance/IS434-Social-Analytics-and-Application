"If I were a tree." If I were a tree, what colours of the rainbow (in the air) would I inhale for a healthy mind, heart and body?

Red, for being life-giving?

Orange, for energy and passion?

Yellow, for emitting light and warmth?

Green, for healing and growth?

Blue, for tranquility and inner peace?

Indigo, for wisdom?

Violet, for being God-fearing?

If I were a tree,
what fruits would I bear?

If I were a tree,
what and who would I attract?

If I were a tree, what is my mission in life?

Thankful for a time of quiet reflection as I attended the last of Sarana's @sarana_pastel_atelier  class this circuit breaker.

How has this momentous period in human history changed me? Will it be for the better?
