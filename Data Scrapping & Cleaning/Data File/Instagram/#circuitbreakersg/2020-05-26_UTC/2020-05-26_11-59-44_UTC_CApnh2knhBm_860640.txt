My first time painting my own figurine, I chose Electrico from the Tokidoki DIY unicornos series. 
Love the acrylic markers, gave me all the control I needed ðŸ˜Ž

My Electrico really cool right? Because Little Foot did the teal hair and chose the colours, turned out so bright and cheerful. 
This is addictive and therapeutic.
