I made ham & cheese toasties !! Was craving for it so much but refused to pay for cafe prices so I made my own !

1) Mix butter with honey mustard and apply a thin layer over your bread . I got sunshine Hokkaido milk toast so it’s Super soft !

2) Lots of recipes online uses gruyere cheese but I can’t find it in NTUC so I used Emmental cheese to replace it . It’s the closest ! I’m using two types of cheese inside - emmental & mozzarella cheese 
3) Recipes online say oil the pan with butter but I don’t think there is a need cuz your bread is already buttered

4) so throw in the bread , add ham & cheese and some mustard in between and yay ! Hahahaha 😐🙈🌚 Ok la I know the whole world knows how to make but it’s my first time so yay 🐥🥪🧈🧀 #cheftan #stayhomecooking #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomecookingideas #sgcooking #sghomecooking #sghomecook #sgbreakfast #circuitbreakersg
