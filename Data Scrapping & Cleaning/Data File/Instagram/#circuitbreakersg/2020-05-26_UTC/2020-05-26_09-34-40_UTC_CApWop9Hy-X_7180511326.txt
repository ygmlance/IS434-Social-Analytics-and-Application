Do you see the elephant🐘? Many of you have downloaded our #soundhealingaudio. (If you haven't, 🎵Our audio clip is available for download, ⬆️link in bio) .
.
🙋‍♀️How to reap the most benefits from it? Here are some tips.
.
1. Before listening to the clip, You can set an intention to guide the sound energies to support you. e.g. if you want to feel more positive 😃, you can say the phrase in your heart "I'm happy and feel light" and to recall a time when you felt happiness🌻.
.
2. Listen 👂without expectation, or expect the unexpected. Just like a blind man does not know how an elephant looks like but that doesn't mean it does not exist.
.
3.Listen to the clip repeatedly and regularly. Observe and note down the experience each time and see if you can learn something new about yourself.
.
4. Never judge your experience. Do not put a "good" or "bad" tag on your experience.

🙏And, thank you so much for supporting us and @samhsingapore .
