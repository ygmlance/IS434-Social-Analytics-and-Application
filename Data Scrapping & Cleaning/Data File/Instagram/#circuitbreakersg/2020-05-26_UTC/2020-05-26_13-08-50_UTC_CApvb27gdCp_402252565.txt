COMING SOON | What have we been busy with? Massive shipment that is coming in probably 1.5-2 weeks. Exciting for sure 😍 But really wish there is one button we could click and everything’s done 🤪order, payment, coordinate between suppliers and forwarders, setting retail price, write product description & details, load the products into our online store so our lovely Pickers can do early shopping, etc 🙈 .

We have been receiving lots messages about new collection from Bloomingville. Good news is our orders are finally all secured and we have more than 50 new picks coming soon! We will try our best to open them for pre-order soonest. Stay tuned 😍👌🏻
