Wipe wipe wipe it down wipe. .

It seems like everyone loves to wipe it down lately - some TikTok #wipeitdownchallenge. Jumping on the bandwagon, I did it too but not the original version. I wiped my floor! .

Everything was ready except for the main prop; I didnâ€™t have any spare towels at home! I used paper (some call it kitchen) towels instead and it worked quite all right. Alternatively, socks are fine too but it has to be done on parquet flooring. .

A total of 5 exercises using 2 paper towels:
1. Moving mountain climbers
2. Knee tucks (then move 45 degrees down and back to centre)
3. Crunches
4. Single-leg bridge and curl
5. Wide mountain climbers to push-ups .

30 seconds per exercise, no rest. 
30 seconds rest in between sets.
Go for 4 sets! .
