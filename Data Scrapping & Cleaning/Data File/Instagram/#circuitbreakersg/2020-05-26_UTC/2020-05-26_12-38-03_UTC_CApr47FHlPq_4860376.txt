While waiting for my (Michelin-anointed) char kway teow (fried flat rice noodles with cockles, fish cakes, #Chinese #sausage, bean sprouts, egg) at Lao Fu Zi I noticed the CKT uncle meticulously running each dollar bill he had over this little candle. When I asked if if was a ritual for luck, the auntie laughed and shook her head. “Sa jun!” She said. “Killing virus!” Ah. #latergram #sglife #oldairportroadfoodcentre #charkwayteow #covid_19 #covid19 #circuitbreakersg
