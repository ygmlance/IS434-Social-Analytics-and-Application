Circuit breaker Day 50: Arcade fish soup 👍👍👍 (Wow 50 days of having different dabao lunches!) A fish soup with a brand, Arcade doesn’t really need an introduction for those in the CBD. Arcade’s fish soup broth is unique, more peppery than most (I prefer the milk version of theirs). Really like their addition of Sichuan veg & egg tofu, makes it special. Definitely the heavier/rich kind of fish soup, not your light clean 清汤 kind - which also means I won’t have arcade more than a few times a year. Glad they offer a flat $8 delivery option this period, so my non-CBD going parents can try it.
