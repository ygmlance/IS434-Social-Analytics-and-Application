Circuit Breaker Day 50: ðŸ’• bought me a Japanese HigoGreen Melon to cheer me up over the weekend. A big deal to me 'coz it costs $19.80 for a small one, one of the more expensive melons i have eaten (before i get my hands on yubari melons), OMG super sweet! I just learnt that it is grown on fertile volcanic soil in the city of Kumamoto on Japanese island Kyushu, wow i'm stoked.
