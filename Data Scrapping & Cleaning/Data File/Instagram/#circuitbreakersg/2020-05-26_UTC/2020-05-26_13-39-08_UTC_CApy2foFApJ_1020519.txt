My roots were always in pop jazz, and itâ€™s been a while since I sang jazz for you! ðŸ¥° Hereâ€™s a live one from our earlier Friday live shows, when we first hit 1000+ viewers and everyone was getting excited haha (we now average 50,000 views every Friday thanks to you guys!) #flymetothemoon #popjazz #takeawaylive #keweisings #alfredxkewei #alfredsings #circuitbreakersg #sgunited #stayhome #stayhomerforsg
