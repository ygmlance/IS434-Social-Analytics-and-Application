Mala Xiang Guo 麻辣香锅 (Spicy numbing stir-fry) 🤤 
Been seeing a lot ppl selling this Haichijia Sour & Spicy Noodle Have tried, it’s good, it’s not spicy but will numb ur tongue. But sour and really shiok! Very appetising.
(Go get it from ezbuy, it’s cheaper😏) Really like chewy/silky kind of noodle and decided to use Six Fortune Mung bean thread noodle for Mala xiang guo and added some Mala abalone from @imperialpremiumseafood 👍🏻👍🏻🤤🤤🤤🔥
