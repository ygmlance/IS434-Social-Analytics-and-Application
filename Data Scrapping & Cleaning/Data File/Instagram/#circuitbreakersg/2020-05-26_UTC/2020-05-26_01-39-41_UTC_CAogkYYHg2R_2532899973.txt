I counted my plants and it exceeds just a little from the sqm of my apartment. It’s at 80 now 😂 Here’s my hidden fav. You know, my plants kinda die after I put it on IG. Is it cause you all curse them? 😒 Social media either helps or kill you indeed. We are not here for competition on who has the rarest or coolest plant. We are not here for competition. We are here to advise one another and be better than what all these evil are. Yes we can’t hide from what they say the evil eye but do remember, god gives and he has apportioned what you will get before you were created. Can we just be nice to one another? No don’t DM me to come to church or mosque. Please don’t! .
