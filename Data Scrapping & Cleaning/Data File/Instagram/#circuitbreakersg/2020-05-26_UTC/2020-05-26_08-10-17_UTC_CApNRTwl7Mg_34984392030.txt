🐻Counting Bears Colour Sorting🌈
.
.
A few weeks ago, I succumbed to the temptation of buying counting bear counters. There are 60 pieces of them, and the assortment comprises 10 counters per colour (so 6 colours in total). There are so many things that can be done with these counters! ⚡️
.
.
For our first counting bears activity, we did colour sorting. I cut out bears matching the colours of the bear counters, and stuck the sheets onto a muffin tray. Then, I got J to put the respective coloured bears into the right hole. I’d initially wanted him to practise his pincer grasp by using a pair of mini tongs, but he preferred to use his hands instead cos he just loved the feel of the bears! 🤚🏻

It was a great activity; interactive and met its goal. J loved it! 😻
