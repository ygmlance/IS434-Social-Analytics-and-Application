Pulled out the last pieces of the frozen KFC chicken and whipped up another Japanese Devil Cooked Rice for dinner... This time I kicked it up a notch on the flavour and added bacon fat, chopped garlic, white pepper and only one bottle of Brand's chicken essence... Served it with some broccoli so it would seem semi-healthy (haha ya right) and topped it with the leftover roast beef, red wine and garlic gravy... If I thought the other day's Devil Cooked Rice was the bomb, then today's was an explosive atomic bomb! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
