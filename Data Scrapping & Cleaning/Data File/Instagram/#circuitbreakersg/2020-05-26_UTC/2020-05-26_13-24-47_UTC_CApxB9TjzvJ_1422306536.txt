Hope everyone had a great start of the week after a long weekend! This is my overdue update for my progress! 
Today is the 36th day of my headstand self-challenge and I am so excited that it is my first time to be able to complete a headstand flow with control though I barely hold my legs up for 3 seconds. 
For this 36-day journey, I tried different methods to be able to achieve the headstand pose. Besides the valuable sharing from my yogi friends, I learnt to be mindful of how my body feel when I am doing the pose and recognised there is a gap between how I feel and what it is when I reviewed the video of my practices.

All the small steps and improvements I made are from my recognition of the gap and I strengthened that part and improve it bit by bit. 
It is painful to look at our weakness, but if we can be open-minded and endure the pain, look for a solution and put it into action, we will eventually be able to achieve what we want ☺️ I am still not quite done with the headstand pose. Stay tune for the next update! .
