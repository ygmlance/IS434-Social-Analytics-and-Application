And my bread adventures begin. My first Soft milk bun !!! I find it quite unbelievable that I had hopped onto the circuit baker fever coz I have never baked in my life before this circuitbreaker.
Great sense of satisfaction when my bread turned out nice,  soft and yummy, though my hands and back almost broke from all the kneading of that sticky doughðŸ˜… 
oh well ,still worth all the effort coz my baby girl enjoyed it so much ... including my very fussy ah lao.ðŸ˜œ
Happy mummy Happy wife!
