📍Winnie’s

The one and only cup of bubble tea I’ve had since circuit breaker started was from Winnie’s (@winnies.sg ), who’ve collaborated with Zoey’s Diner to sell their beverages! My first time trying their drinks and I got the Black Sugar Caramel Milk Tea with Pearls ($4.10 for M). 🥛 Perhaps because I’m not a fan of overly-sweet, diabetics-inducing drinks, but I found this too sweet for my liking. The caramel taste was strong, perfect for those who like the taste of it, yet I’d have preferred it to be less strong and for the drink to have a more prominent tea taste. 💁🏻‍♀️ Would I buy this drink again? Unlikely. But I might try their Classic Afternoon Milk Tea next time cos i’m guessing that I would like that better☀️ .
