👩‍🍳MUNCH AT HOME👩‍🍳
Binging on Marion’s Kitchen videos a little too much soooo we went thai and vietnamese for our dinner! Fresh spring rolls are our absolute favourite coz you can load it with all sorts of veggies and feel healthy after eating that😋 We also enjoyed the pineapple 🍍fried rice and thai basil pork🐷 as they were easy to whip up but tastes amazing❤️!!!
