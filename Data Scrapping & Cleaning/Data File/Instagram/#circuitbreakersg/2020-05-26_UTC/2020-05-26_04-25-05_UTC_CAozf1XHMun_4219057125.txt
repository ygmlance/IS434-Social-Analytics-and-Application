Baked huge copycat Levain Bakery choc chip crush cookies to satisfy the cravings (and prepare for the coming stressful days). Incorporated with dark (85% and 73%) and milk chocolate inside. This turned out crisp on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle. So good. I had to stop myself from finishing a whole cookie!
