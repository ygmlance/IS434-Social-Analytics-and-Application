Miles Davis - Kind of Blue, 1959. So many accolades given to this album. Here it is today in remembrance of the last surviving member of this band, Jimmy Cobb, who passed away today aged 91. Apart from Miles, Cobb worked with other greats including John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter, and only released his first album as leader in 1983. In Kind of Blue, Miles told him before the set “Jimmy, you know what to do. Just make it sound like it’s floating.” So today I listen to this record again, listening to Jimmy’s wonderful work on the cymbal and snare. It’s floating indeed!
