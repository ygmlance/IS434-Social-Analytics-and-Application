Hi friends,
Hope you are all keeping well. While we await further direction on when we might be able to reopen, we are thrilled to have joined @troublebrewingsg ‘s fantastic #AdoptAPub initiative. 
These guys are doing their bit to support #FnB establishments like ours. All you have to do is place an order with them using the code HERO and 10% of the #beer purchase amount will go directly to Hero's, at no cost to you.

Check out the amazing locally-brewed craft beers they have on offer.
