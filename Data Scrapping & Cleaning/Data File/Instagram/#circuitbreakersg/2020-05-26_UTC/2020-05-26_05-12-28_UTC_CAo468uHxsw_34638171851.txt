[Earlybird Cafe]
.
By the same masterminds before the famous waffle cafe, @revelry_sg , @earlybirdsg is a cafe nestled 5 mins away from Bugis MRT. They are known for their fried chicken and pancakes (which i’ll try soon 😂) .
Earl Grey Hotcakes: A unique twist to hotcakes; earl grey flavoured hotcakes! The pancake was warm and fluffy and was served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and berries. Loved how the flavour of earl grey was not too mild too and it really went well with the ice cream. Finished the hotcake in 5 minutes because they were so good ☺️
