Tried out @carrie_pages_pilatesâ€™ brilliant transitions from abdominal work to side leg lift series (part of her @pilatesanytimeus 10-day Reset challenge) today. Throw in any of the side-lying moves to challenge the lateral parts of the body even more. Here, I included leg circles to mobilise the muscles around the hip joints. This is some cardio-pumping Pilates!
