Day 50 Circuit Breaker Lunch. One of our favourite dining spots near office!

Yummy Buta Kakuni Don (Braised Pork Belly Don) and Unadon (River Eel Rice Bowl) from @tamashii_sg 
We also ordered the Deep Fried Chicken Minced Balls and their Home- made Fish Cake with Crab Stuffings (this is yummyðŸ˜‹) for sharing. The Grilled Yellowtail Fish Cheek was already half eaten before I could snap a proper pic. ðŸ¤£
