I made Kabocha (Pumpkin) Salad かぼちゃサラダ for dinner last night. Pumpkin has many health benefits including high in beta carotene, vitamin C, vitamins B1 and B2, and more. 
My salad ingredients include pumpkin, sliced cucumbers , toasted nuts, sliced apples and chicken breast meat. 
To prepare this salad, the pumpkin is boiled until soft then mashed before combining with sliced cucumbers & apples, toasted nuts and chicken breasts. 
Note: Season the sliced cucumbers and apples with salt first before u mix it with other ingredients. It is best to chill it before you enjoy this simple, yet utterly flavorful dish. 
Oh ya.. You can replace the chicken breast meat to bacon or shrimp too. #hzcooks #kabochasalad #かぼちゃサラダ
