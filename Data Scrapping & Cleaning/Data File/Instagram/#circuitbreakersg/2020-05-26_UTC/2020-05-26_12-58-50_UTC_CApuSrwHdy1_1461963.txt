Day 50 of CB (OMG has it been that long???) - Threw together a quick dinner in 30min. Vongole with korean flower clams from @9sseafood. The clam juice added such a rich briny tang I couldnâ€™t get enough of the gravy. Also topped with some pan seared Atlantic scallop because in case the kiddos refuse to eat the clams. Turned out otherwise though so more scallops for me #homecooked #umamilicious #circuitbreakersg
