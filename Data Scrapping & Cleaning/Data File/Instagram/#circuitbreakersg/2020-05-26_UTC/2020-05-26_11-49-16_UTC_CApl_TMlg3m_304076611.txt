One of the things you can do during #circuitbreaker, be a masterchef 👩🏻‍🍳 I’m not much of a stove person, but when it comes to snacks, no problem! 
It was a really fun time making these Korean Hotteoks, thanks to @ksisters.sg ! 
The recipe is so easy and the best part of it, a no-fail yummy snack with brown sugar cinnamon filling.

The Korean Ginseng Soymilk has a very rich soymilk taste and surprisingly the ginseng flavour is pretty subtle. The sweetness of Hotteok is well paired with the non-sweet Soymilk, as the flavours balance each other out.

Do give it a try and have fun making these!! Hope you guys enjoy the Korea experience, thanks for watching ☺️ #hotteok #soymilk #koreanfood #ksisterssg #review #sgfoodies #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
