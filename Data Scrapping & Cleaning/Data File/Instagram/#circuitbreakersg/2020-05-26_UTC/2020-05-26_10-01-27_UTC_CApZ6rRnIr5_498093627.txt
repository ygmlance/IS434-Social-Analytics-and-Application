Wow! Today two years ago we arrived in beautiful Singapore, embarking on a completely new adventure! 🇸🇬⁠
⁠
We traveled for about 24 hours all the way from Miami, Florida. Our first few weeks were super busy: Finding an apartment, setting up bank accounts, buying furniture and other household items, visiting the employment pass service center to get our Singaporean IDs etc. etc. Moving to a different country is a lot of work!⁠
⁠
Life in the city has been amazing! Learning so many new things about different cultures, eating the most delish food and we have a great group of friends. ⁠
⁠
To this day it still blows my mind that I live in one of the biggest cities in the world. Walking around the Marina Bay and seeing the Marina Bay Sands hotel, I still can't believe that we ended up here and are able to walk around the city and feel at home. ⁠
⁠
This time of year we cannot celebrate our 2 year 'singaversary' with a nice dinner and drinks. We are doing our duty of staying at home as much as possible for the health of others. ⁠
