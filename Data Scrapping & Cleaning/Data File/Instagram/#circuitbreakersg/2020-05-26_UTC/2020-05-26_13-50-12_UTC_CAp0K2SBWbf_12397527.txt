#currychicken + #friedbeehoon = #matchmadeinheaven ❤️

Last night's curry & beehoon dinner was so shiok, I made a fresh batch of #beehoon to go with the leftover #curry. Again, we ate too much and had #foodcoma 🤭
•
This is the first time I'm trying #teansgourmet curry paste, thanks to @dalandcrystal recommendation. It's really good! The flavours are more robust, complex and spicy than the usual Mak Nyonya brand I use.
•
Bought it at @fairpricesg VivoCity once. Sadly they don't stock it anymore; regret not buying more 😭 If any kind soul knows where to find this brand in Chinatown / Tiong Bahru / Tanjong Pagar area, please let me know! 🙏🏻
