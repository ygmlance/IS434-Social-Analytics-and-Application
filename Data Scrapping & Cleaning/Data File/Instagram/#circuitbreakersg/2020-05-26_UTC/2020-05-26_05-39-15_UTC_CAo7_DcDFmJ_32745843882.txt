Petals for the sunflower ðŸŒ»
Notice the difference between the ones on the top row vs the bottom. I made a mistake with the instructions and they turned out rounded instead of pointy. Only realised it when I was on to my 8th, redid 3 of the earlier 7 and now 4 more to go. And then I'll continue working on the remaining 12 ðŸ˜­
I was planning on making 2x of these but now I'll focus on just 1 since the petals alone are alr tedious enough ðŸ˜…
