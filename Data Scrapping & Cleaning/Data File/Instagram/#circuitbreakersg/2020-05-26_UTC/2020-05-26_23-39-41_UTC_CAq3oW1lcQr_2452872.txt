The ideas of the artistic vocation, of the artist who has renounced worldly ambitions in order to dedicate himself/ herself to values that cannot be realized by commercial society and the idea of cultural or artistic iconoclasm the artists alienation from society, art as transgression, adversary art, avant - grade these have been conflated. Both seem irrelevant or unreal to most artists now. Both are scorned by art critics. But they are not the same.
-Susan Sontag
