One of the sweetest memories of cb is bathing this little potato almost every night
.
He’s usually all scrubbed clean by the time he was home from his gramps previously
.
During the shower, we chit chat about the day, his classmates and what’s he looking forward to
.
Close to perfect way to end the day
