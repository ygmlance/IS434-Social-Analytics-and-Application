This picture was taken by one of my first few clients. It really brings me back to slightly over 2 years ago when I first started my job. ▪︎ It's amazing how things have turned out after all this time. I still feel choosing this career was one of the best decisions I made. Im in a position where I can advise & help so many people. Through my job I've made so many friends and learnt so much from each and every one of them. ▪︎ My life goal is to make an impact on every single one of my clients' lives. Be it big or small, I still love being able to make a difference. This Covid-19 period has given us all a chance to realise the importance of being adequately protected. Its been an honour to be able to impart knowledge & educate others on the importance of properly planning their finances. ▪︎ One of the most beautiful blessings is to be able to do what you're passionate about.
