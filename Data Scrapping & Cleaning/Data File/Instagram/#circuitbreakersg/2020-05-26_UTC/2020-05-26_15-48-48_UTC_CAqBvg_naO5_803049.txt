For many climbers our scapulas, lats, and core are strong enough to raise our bodies up, and even stay engaged and stabilize us during the first half of the movement. ⁣

I realized that in my case, even though I had been activating my core as much as I could and was squeezing my butt to extend my hips, 𝐈 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐲 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝𝐧’𝐭 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐲 𝐡𝐢𝐩𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐦𝐲 𝐡𝐚𝐦𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐟𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭. ⁣⁣

There are 2 explanations for this.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
1️⃣ Long periods of sitting ⁣⁣
2️⃣ Lack of flexibility and mobility exercises in my day-to-day⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Based on my recent training history, I knew that tightness was more of an issue than weakness. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
So while I had programmed more targeted hip and core strength and extension exercises into my training, 𝐈 𝐤𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐦𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐡𝐚𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐲 𝐝𝐚𝐲, 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐚 𝐟𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐝 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐝𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠. ⁣

These would only take 5-10 minutes, but they would be peppered throughout the day. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Strength is great, but if your body struggles to get into a position, to begin with, then perhaps you need to consider that it could be an issue of mobility instead. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Strength is great, but it doesn’t matter if your postural, movement, and lifestyle habits are setting you back on the flexibility you need to perform the exercises that you are want. Worse — it’s costing you your health. ⁣
⁣
In the grand scheme of things, these habits don’t take much time and they are immensely rewarding (as it has been for my front lever training) and can save us money and heartache when it comes to treating and living through injury from neglect. ⁣⁣
