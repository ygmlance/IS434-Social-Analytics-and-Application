There is so much to be thankful for during this Circuit Breaker.  Yes, we have been slightly inconvenienced (for our safety) but what we have gained is greater.  The chance to have so much family time together has seen my kids go from seeing each other not just as siblings but now as friends as well.  It is especially heartwarming to see J help L with her workbooks and to hear them chit chatting away about things. .
.
Highlight of circuit breaker is that Josiah talked to Lauren about accepting Jesus into her heart of his own accord and called us only to lead her in prayer. .
.
We have been able to do loads of pizza nights much to J's delight and baking to bless others when the kids were thinking of ways to show care.  I have learned Chinese as Josiah learns and he even corrects my tones hahah. 
We celebrated Lauren's birthday over ZOOM and she now expects regular tea parties ðŸ¤£. I actually don't mind this haha. .
.
There have been some tough times (HBL anyone??) but there have been more nuggets of gold.  So thankful for our life group and larger church community who know how to love well. .
