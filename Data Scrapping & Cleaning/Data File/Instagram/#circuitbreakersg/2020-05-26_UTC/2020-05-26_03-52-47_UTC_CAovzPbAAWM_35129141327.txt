We made it to Day 50 of our Circuit Breaker!  This “lock down” has its up and down. Somehow felt like a long staycation to me and thoroughly enjoy this zen moments to sketch and doodles. And of course the wonderful bonding time at home. But all fun has to end, we should get back to schedule soon! Before the purse strings goes bust! #zentanglelovers #circuitbreakersg #zeninspiration #zentangle
