Money is good, don’t get me wrong. With money you can buy nice house, good car and a nice night in Geylang. However, singaporeans really do focus on money too much. I get that our prices are like 5 times more ex than anywhere else but chill guys, it’s not a competition to see who can flex the most. Most people are fairly well do in Singapore and the government does provide lots of stuff to the less fortunate. So all the boomers complaining about no money should just open their eyes a bit bigger. There’s plenty of job opportunities out there, you don’t have to stubbornly stick to one. Move around until you find something you love. And the money won’t even matter :)
