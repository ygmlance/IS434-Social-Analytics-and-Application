Since we didn't get to eat Tom Yum Goong last night, let's have Tom Yum Fried Rice today. Because Fried Rice is for friyay üòÖ

As usual cooked my rice (with lesser water) earlier this morning before starting my meetings. Once cooked, remove from cooker allowing it to cool down and dry up for couple of hours.

Fried Rice & Bak Kwa is always a perfect pairing. Glad our @HupChong Bak Kwa (Original & Spicy) & Pork Floss arrived few days ago is in time for this.

Enjoy your weekend!

P.S Thanks @ennieeee for the Tom Yum paste bought from Thailand üíù
