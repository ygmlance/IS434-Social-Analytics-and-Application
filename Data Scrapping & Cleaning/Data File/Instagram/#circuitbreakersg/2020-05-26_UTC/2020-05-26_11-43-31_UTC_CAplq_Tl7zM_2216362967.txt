Braised Pork Belly ‚Ä¢ one pot wonders

The thing I love about cooking braised pork belly is that we can have it with rice for dinner, the next morning wrap it in lotus leaf buns for breakfast. And if there‚Äôs still leftovers, have it with noodles for lunch. üòÅ

Pork preparation:
Boil ~550g cut pork belly with a few slices of ginger for 5 mins. Drain and marinate for 30 mins with:
1tbsp soy sauce
1tbsp dark soy sauce
1/2 tsp five-spiced powder
1/4 tsp white pepper 
1/4 tsp salt

Prepare Sauce & set aside:
2tbsp soy sauce
1tbsp dark soy sauce
1tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp five-spiced powder
1/4 tsp white pepper
1/4 tsp salt

Add 2tbsp oil to heated wok. Stir fry 8 cloves garlic, 2 cinnamon sticks, 3 star anise, 3 ding xiang until fragrant. Add in marinated pork and stir fry to mix with the spices. Pour in Sauce and 1tbsp yellow rock sugar, stir to combine. Pour in 4 cups of water (water level has to be higher than the pork) and simmer for 30 mins. 
At this point, add in other side ingredients like hard-boiled eggs, mushrooms, tau gwa. Top up with water to cover the ingredients. Continue to simmer for another 1 hour. Check that sauce has reached your desired consistency. Serve!

Note to self: 
1) Next time increase total simmering time to 2h - Simmer pork for 1 hour, add in side ingredients and top up with water, then simmer for another 1 hour.
2) Modify and include sweet soy sauce (kecap manis) in Sauce prep - 
2tbsp soy sauce
2tbsp sweet soy sauce
1/2 tsp five-spiced powder
1/4 tsp white pepper
1/4 tsp salt
