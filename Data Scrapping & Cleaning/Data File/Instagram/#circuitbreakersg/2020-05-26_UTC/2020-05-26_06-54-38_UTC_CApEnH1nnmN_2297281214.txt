My little version of Lu Rou Fan (Taiwanese braised pork rice Êª∑ËÇâÈ£Ø) for "circuit breaker" day 50's lunch... Served @iamivanlau's with rice and I had mine without... This is one of my favourite comfort food when I'm in Taiwan... Truly sad that the current situation doesn't allow us enjoy our foodie travels but it is what it is... Hoping things will gradually get better... Keep safe and be healthy, everyone! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
