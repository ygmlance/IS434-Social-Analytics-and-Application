Day 50 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (26 May 2020) - Another #nofilter #easypeasy #lunchforone made from #leftovers using the #leftover pie filling from last night's dinner (which contained the last of the $4.90 roast chicken from Day 45, so this is the 5th and last meal I made with that same chicken; even the bones were used!), the other half potato that I didn't use last night, the last bit of #broccoli in the fridge that was starting to yellow and the last bit of #mascarpone in the fridge; as a sauce for some #fettucine - bit of a carb overload but so #yummy ! #wastenotwantnot #homecooking #stayhomestaysafe !
