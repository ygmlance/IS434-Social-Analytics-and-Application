Day 50 of #circuitbreakersg.  Missing the many walks at Gardens by the Bay & especially the olive trees at the Flower Dome. Have always marvelled at their resilience against drought, disease & fire. Living longer than a human lifespan. 
Managed to capture during the many visits in 2019, the trees flowering & fruiting. Looking forward to the day when we can once again roam our garden city #simplejoys #homesg #gardencitysg #olivetree #flowerdomeingardensbythebay #latergram #throwback2019
