Pan-seared salmon and Brussels sprouts üçΩ
‚Å£
First time cooking one of my favourite vegetables at home. Didn't know Brussels sprouts contain so many different types of nutrients. I guess that makes their relatively higher price worth it. These were a bit too caramelised, i.e. slightly burnt, but still tasted great haha. Do you like eating Brussels sprouts?
