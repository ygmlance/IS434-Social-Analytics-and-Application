Need a quick fix for lunch

Tired of the usual options

COVID makes some things inaccessible

It has also given us more time at home

And some bosses demand more time at work

Here is a simple take on Bruschetta.

Items needed:
Baguette
Cherry tomatoes (cut into 4)
Basil leaves (chop the leaves)
Cream cheese (Fresh Mozarella / Burrata if you want more oomph)

Toast the bread to warm it up
Apply cheese
Layer the tomatoes pieces
Layer the chopped basil leaves
Serve
