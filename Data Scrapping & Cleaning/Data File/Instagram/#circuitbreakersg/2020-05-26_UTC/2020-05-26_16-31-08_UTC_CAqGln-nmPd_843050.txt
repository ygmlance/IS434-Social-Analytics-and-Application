*Prawn Broth Noodles*

It’s the last week of the May hols and #circuitbreakersg, plus after a long weekend, I felt really lazy and uninspired to cook. On weekends my kitchen is usually closed, to take a break from meal preps so I can allocate time to do other house chores or just relax.
.

So being the last week of hols, it’s time to clear out the fridge too. Decided to use the prawn shells I’ve kept previously to make a simple but hearty Prawn Broth Noodle Soup for lunch today. .

I just boiled the prawn shells for about 20 minutes, then added some chicken stock to add on some more flavour and savouriness, plus dark soy sauce for colour. Ingredients were what I have in my freezer: lean pork & frozen wanton. Noodle of choice was Udon. I made these eggs to lend more effort to the dish hahah. The whole bowl turned out really well and was slurped down quickly by the fam! .
