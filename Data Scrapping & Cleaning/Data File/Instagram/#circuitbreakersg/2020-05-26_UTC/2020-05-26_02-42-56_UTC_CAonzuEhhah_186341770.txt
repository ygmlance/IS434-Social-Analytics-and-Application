It is the simplest thing in life we take for granted... freedom! Covid19 has taught us this simple thing call "appreciation". ♥️👍🏻
.
It was sunsets that taught me that beauty sometimes only lasts for a couple of moments. 😍👍🏻
.
It was sunrises that showed me that all it takes is patience to experience it all over again. 🥰👍🏻
.
If we want our freedom to be back, we need to have patience to endure the darkness. We can see the beautiful sunset again as long as we stay safe at home! 😍👍🏻
.
I am reminding myself here as well. ♥️👍🏻
.
Hope you have a beautiful week ahead. 🥰👍🏻
