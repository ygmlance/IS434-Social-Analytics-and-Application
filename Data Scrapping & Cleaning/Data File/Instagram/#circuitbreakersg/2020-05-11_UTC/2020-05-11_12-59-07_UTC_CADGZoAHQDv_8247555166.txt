Lunch time! ðŸ¥„
âœ¨
And I decided to cook for Mum this time! As sheâ€™s having swollen gums, I prepared something simple of shredded chicken and sliced pork porridge using the rice cooker. Boiled the stock from chicken bones and dried anchovies, and used Japanese brown rice for a healthy dose of wholegrain! #stayhomewithluzerne
