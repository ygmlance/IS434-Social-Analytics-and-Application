Itâ€™s Monday and Day 35 of our #circuitbreakersg with another 3 more weeks to go to the end. Then I can go run at the stadium (I hope) and maybe have a quick meal at a coffee shop or cafe and see my loved ones or some friends. But till then we will keep moving and looking forward. Stay safe, everyone!
