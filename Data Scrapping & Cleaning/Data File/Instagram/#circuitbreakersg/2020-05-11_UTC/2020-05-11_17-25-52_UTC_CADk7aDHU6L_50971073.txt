Messy unimpressive photos of our dinner today... my 1st try on 鸡公煲 and we cleared the whole pot without anything left... not even a drop of soup... not super delicious but i loved it... .
Brunch i did my 1st Char Siew without using the ready made Char Siew Sauce... used Pork Jowl instead... at least hubs n kids approved it... #circuitbreakersg Day 35...
