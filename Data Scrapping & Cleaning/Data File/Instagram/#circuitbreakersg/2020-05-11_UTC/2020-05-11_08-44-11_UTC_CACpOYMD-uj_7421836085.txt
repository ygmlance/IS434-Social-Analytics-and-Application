Today we look at one of the main components of the Feng Shui the Main Door, as the previous post stated that the Main Door talk about the wealth capacity to the unit. 
To determine how much wealth can the house bring to the occupants, we look at which direction the Main Door face. Having it face the not so auspicious direction will make a whole lot of different. 
As the saying goes, if you think you are not doing good now. Try moving to a new place, be it buy or rent. You will be able to see the difference as fast as three months.
