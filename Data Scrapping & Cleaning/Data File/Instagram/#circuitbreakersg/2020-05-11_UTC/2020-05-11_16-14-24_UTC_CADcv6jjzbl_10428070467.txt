‚òÜUnder The Sea Workshop‚òÜ
One of my favourite creations, the vibrancy of the colours and fishes never fail to perk one's senses!

Yixin, the spartan pastel art enthusiast with incredible painting stamina, did an incredible job on her artwork! We did spend a tad too long working on the stencils but I'm thankful that Yixin was always so chirpy and patient despite the slight challenge! Her choice of colours inspired me to reach for pink and I think it added a nice pop of colour to the sea of blue and turquoise. Both of us used the soft pastels set from @omniworldsg and I really like the colour payoff - intense and rich.

Thank you for spending a Monday afternoon with me Yixin! I'll be seeing you very soon again!
