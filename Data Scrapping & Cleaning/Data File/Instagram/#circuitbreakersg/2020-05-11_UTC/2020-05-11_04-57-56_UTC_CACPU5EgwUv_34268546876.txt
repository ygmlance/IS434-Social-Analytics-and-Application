To our Overly Cheezy fam, your health and well-being are very important to us. We are working hard to keep our spaces safe and clean for you when you visit our store for takeaway orders.

It is a blessing to be able to keep our ovens warm to serve you during this Circuit Breaker. If you are craving the dough while at home, we are just a call away!

Our pizza flavours can be found on the 'Menu' IG story highlights - select from our 10 favourite combinations in the ala carte menu or build your very own DIY pizza.

Our handmade pizzas are made to order, fresh out of the oven. We offer delivery straight to your door for all Hougang, Kovan and Seng Kang kakis!

Call +65 6245 4922 to place your order now or visit us at Blk 311 Hougang Ave 5 #01-189 S530311 now! We are open daily, 7 days a week, from 11am to 11pm.
