Covid19 circuit breaker day 35, 11 May 20:

I have a fear of singing. Specifically, singing in public, in front of people, even in front of one person.

Yup, not many knows about this, and it‚Äôs legit terrifying to me. Not sure how long I‚Äôve had this fear. But after some advice from a chance encounter last year, I decided to go for my very first ever singing lesson. I asked around and was referred to @theloonbird .

My first lesson in May 2019, NERVE WRECKING. I‚Äôm not one with comfort zones, and I can do and try almost anything, but learning how to sing was a huge step out of my comfort zone. Fucking leap of faith this one.

The amount of patience @theloonbird has with me is god-like, coaching me on my vocals, pronounciation, breathing techniques, pitching.. and she‚Äôs still coaching me on all those hahahaha. I remembered I would hesitate and wimper and squirm, just to sing a few notes.

But if I were to compare my now with then, it‚Äôs just funny how I‚Äôve learnt quite a bit despite my fear, most importantly to be comfortable with my own voice.

During this cb period, she surprised me by magically creating a nice version of the rap recordings I practiced with her (I did practice how to sing pop songs, but let‚Äôs not go there..), and by the grace of hiphop gods.. a rap verse sung by me. Hahahaha

ASAP Ferg - Plain Jane. CRINGE-worthy. 
But here‚Äôs me, putting myself out there.

And here‚Äôs to you @cheryl.loon for helping me to overcome my fear! Major love and gratitude to you always for showing me the ropes and leaving me in awe with your singing, everytime.
