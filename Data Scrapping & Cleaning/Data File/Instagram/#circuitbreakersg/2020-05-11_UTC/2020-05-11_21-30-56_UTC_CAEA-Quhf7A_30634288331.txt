"All birds are born to fly," thinks Baby Bird, watching the other hatchlings leave the nest. "I suppose it's now or never..." â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
But one of Baby's wings is twisted and shrunken and not at all like the other one. Instead of flying, Baby plummets to the ground. There, Baby makes a new friend, and learns that sometimes you have to find unexpected ways to achieve your dreams. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â € â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
