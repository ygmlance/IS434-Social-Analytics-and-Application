Keeping to a keto diet requires A LOT of dedication. I am barely keeping up. So thank goodness there is a keto meal delivery service called Ketomei.
Essentially it’s a high end tingkat service and the food is quite good. They sent me six meals (good for 3 days), and there were more hits than missed.
This is the Cajun barramundi with delicious flavourful vegetables. The spicy coconut chicken is absolutely wonderful. Swipe left for videos of some of the meals.
The set is not cheap but keto is not. But the portions and tastiness make up for it.
If you’re launching on a keto diet, this could be a good intro because you’ll be able to get an idea of what’s available for you. If only Ketomei offer desserts too ....
