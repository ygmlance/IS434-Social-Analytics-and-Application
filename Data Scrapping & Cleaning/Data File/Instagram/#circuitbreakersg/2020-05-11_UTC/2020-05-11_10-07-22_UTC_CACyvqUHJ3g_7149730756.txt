As we continue to stay safe at home this period, let's not forget those who are in need. In today’s #PowerGoodMondays, we would like to shine the spotlight on @kindnessmart - a local social enterprise that aims to support and aid the disadvantaged in society via the sale of groceries and necessities on their E-Commerce platform.  They also work closely with many different charitable and non-profit organizations island-wide.

Despite the COVID-19 situation causing a huge drop in companies participating in Kindness Mart's Corporate Social Responsibilities programs, the group continues working hard to keep operations running amid this difficult time.

A small individual action can make a huge difference when we do it collectively. Let us pitch in to make a change, together.

Find out about the different ways you can contribute to Kindness Mart’s many beneficiaries by visiting their Instagram page.
