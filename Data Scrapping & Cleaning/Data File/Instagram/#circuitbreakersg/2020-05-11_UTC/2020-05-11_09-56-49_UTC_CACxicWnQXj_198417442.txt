💖Traditional Pandan Waffles💖
Mum always saves the best for me including food. 🥰 She so cute la. She came home tell me she bought waffles for me from her workplace. Say always long queue one. Today no queue so she buy for me to try. 💓

These waffles not green colour but I can taste the fragrant Pandan and it’s soft and ma chiang kueh kind of chewy. Reminiscing my childhood days. 😍
