"Circuit Breaker" by Chao
A graphic short story 
Here’s a little pandemic lockdown fantasy to entertain you. We are almost halfway through 2020 and many of us have spent the past few weeks or even months under some form of quarantine or social distancing measures. Here in Singapore, we are in the midst of a so-called "Circuit-Breaker" period, during which schools and most workplaces are shut down and non-essential workers only allowed to go out for groceries, food and solitary physical exercises. The Circuit-Breaker is currently set to end on June 1st but there is always a possibility that it may be extended (it had already been extended once). Life in lockdown hasn’t been easy but I’m grateful that we live in a time where it’s possible to order food, watch the latest movies, take a course, buy groceries or even have a family reunion online.

What’s life been like in your city or town during this period? I hope you are keeping healthy and sane! Leave a comment!
