Day 35 Circuit Breaker Dinner. Need to cook the Spicy Mentaiko I bought from Don Don Donki last week. It's been sitting in the freezer. No spaghetti, and no cream at home... So I'll just make do with the other types of pastas that I have. I chose the mini elbow pasta so that every piece can be coated by the pollock roe (I think!). Also used olive oil and butter as fats for the mentaiko to stick onto the pasta. Turned out not too bad!❣️ 😅😋
