The word Peranakan — which can have very broad and labile meanings in Malay and Indonesian and, when used in common parlance, is simply an indicator of heritage or descent — may also be used to refer to other ethnic groups in the same region.

However, the latter usage tends to be less common, and the prominence of Peranakan Chinese culture has led to the common elision whereby the word "Peranakan" on its own is often used to refer specifically to the Peranakan Chinese.

The Peranakan Chinese are also sometimes referred to as the Straits Chinese or Straits-born Chinese, though these terms are not interchangeable.
