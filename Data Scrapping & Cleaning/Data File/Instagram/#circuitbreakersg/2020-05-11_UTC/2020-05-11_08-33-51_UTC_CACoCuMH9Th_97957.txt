#Tbt us at week one..
Exhausted to the max. Surviving on Netflix and caffeine.
.
Although the newborn bit is much easier the second time round. We seemed to forget the hard parts as well...
The constant feedings, breastfeeding pains etc...
.
.
Having said that, there were tons of things to be grateful for!
.
Because Nathan came early, we were able to have our confinement nanny 1 week before the sg-my lockdown. And boy was she helpful!.
(I don’t however regret not having one after my first pregnancy. There’s pros and cons to both!)
.
We were blessed to have family and loved ones over to visit for a week before measures were tightened.

Time to heal..
