It’s pizza and frittata night at the original @casamanini  when we are off on Mondays. Kiddos made pizzas with their papa while I sorted out a frittata. We don’t get much time with the kiddos even during lockdown but we are so thankful to be be able to keep our restaurant open throughout #circuitbreakersg Can’t always have everything, but thankful for health, family, friends, life. Stay safe. Stay sane and stay home. #andràtuttobene
