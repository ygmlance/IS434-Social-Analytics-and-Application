Never known a cat who does not tuck their tail around themselves when sitting down. Cherry Cat bites her thumb at typical cat behaviours: claiming her latest favourite family member with a tail curl, flicking her tail whilst obviously happy and cussing like a sailor if we deign to suggest that she is being a bit badly behaved (eating our plants!). #cherrycat #myhumanmyslave #whyiseveryonehere  #washyourmouthout #circuitbreakersg
