𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟑𝟒 – Ordered @chirchirsg again for #Mothersday lunch yesterday as she was at work the previous round! This time, we ordered 𝙃𝙤𝙣𝙚𝙮 𝘽𝙪𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝘾𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙣, 𝙍𝙤𝙨𝙚𝙢𝙖𝙧𝙮 𝙍𝙤𝙖𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝘾𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙣 (𝙃𝙖𝙡𝙛) and 𝘾𝙝𝙞𝙧 𝘾𝙝𝙚𝙚𝙨𝙚 𝙁𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨 from @chirchirsg as well as 𝙉𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙚 𝙋𝙞𝙯𝙯𝙖 from @nipongnaepongsg!⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣
Decided to order only on Thursday evening and — horror of horrors — the earliest delivery slot available is 2 to 330pm. Went ahead to place my order and was prepared for late delivery since it’s Mother’s Day. Was pleasantly surprised that my order came within the time-frame. In fact, delivery came at 3pm sharp! Good job!⁣⁣ 👍🏻⁣⁣

PS: They’ve partnered with @thealley.sg to include their range of bubble tea for delivery, so you can get both your Korean Fried Chicken & BBT cravings satisfied at one go! Check out @chirchirsg’s page for more deets!
