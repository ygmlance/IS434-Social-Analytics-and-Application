ARTIST PROFILE - VENEZIA MAY

TRUE OR FALSE? 
Veneziaâ€™s first CB virtual date was spent watching a man build a lego castle with his daughter.
React ðŸ˜® for TRUE or ðŸ˜‚ for FALSE

Venezia canâ€™t reach the top shelf at Sheng Siong but will attempt to carry you to reach that budget friendly bottle of wine / cookie dough ice cream.

She can most likely out-plank you but if she likes you sheâ€™ll let you win so you think youâ€™re stronger. She once won a lap dance at a Bad Dating Stories Party for a story about first dates, Cards Against Humanity gone wrong, and smegma.

If sheâ€™s busy, it's probably because sheâ€™s creating a Tinder profile for her grandma, or snacking.

GET PERSONAL!
