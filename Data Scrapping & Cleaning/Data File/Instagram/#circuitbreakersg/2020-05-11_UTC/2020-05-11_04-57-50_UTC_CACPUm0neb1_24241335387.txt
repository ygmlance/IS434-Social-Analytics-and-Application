"Buy frozen lobster tail or cooked lobster if you can't find live lobster"

Ingredients:
2 lbs (908g) small lobster 
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon lemon juice 
1 pinch salt 
3 dashes ground black pepper 
1/2 tablespoon chopped chives 
3 hot dog buns
2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
Directions:
Crack the lobster shells, pick the meat from the tail and claws. Cut lobster meat into bite sized pieces.

Add the mayonnaise, honey, lemon juice, salt, black pepper and chives together, set aside.

Trim about 1/4 inch off both sides of the hot dog buns. Spread the butter on the sides. Heat up a skillet on medium heat and cook the sides until they are nicely toasted and become golden brown. Fill the inside of the buns with the lobsters. Serve immediately.
