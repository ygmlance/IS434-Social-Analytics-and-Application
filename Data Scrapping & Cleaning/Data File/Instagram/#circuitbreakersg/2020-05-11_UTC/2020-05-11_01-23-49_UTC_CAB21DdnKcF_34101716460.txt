Quick and easy #breakfast to start another week! #johnsonvillesausage in a fluffy homemade traditional hotdog roll🌭 and a fluffy cheese🧀 #scrambledeggs on the side. I love my hotdog buns and scrambled eggs with lots of #ketchup and #mustard. PSA: The hotdog roll was bought from my family’s all time favourite (and IMHO the best bakery in Sg) - Katong Sin Chew Cake shop. This bakery sells the fluffiest breads.🍞My personal favourite,  which I highly recommend, is the curry bread. I’ve had it for more than a decade and it always taste 10/10! (see location tag for the address of the bakery) #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
