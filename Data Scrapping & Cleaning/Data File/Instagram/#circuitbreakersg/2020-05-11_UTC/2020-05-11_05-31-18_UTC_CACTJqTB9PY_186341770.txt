I long for the empty streets and miles to go before I sleep. For the untamed freedom of stories untold. 😍👍🏻
.
For long dark nights not a soul in sight. For the throbbing heartbeat of the open road! ♥️👍🏻

It has been a journey battling with everyone in this world with the coronavirus. And this is gonna be a long waiting game. I truly felt staying away from your love ones is an act of responsibility. It's something I can comprehend but still hard to accept. ♥️👍🏻
.
Even tho it is hard not able to travel, but I still count my blessings, at least I can still do my part. At least I can comfortably stay at home! 🥰👍🏻

To be honest, I delighted to hear many encouraging words that there are people looking forward to my positive message everyday. I honestly didnt even believe there will be people interested in my thoughts, in my words and my sharings. 🙏🏻
.
There are times I thought about giving up postings and all social media stuff... but I realised I actually established many real connections with amazing people like you. That also provides me positivity and words of encouragement. Sharing with me your stories and reminding me know I'm blessed. ♥️👍🏻

I guess this is the blessings I have for all the "hard work" through these years om Travel Inspiration 360. My tagline... "to inspire and be inspired". Indeed, what goes around comes around. 😍👍🏻
