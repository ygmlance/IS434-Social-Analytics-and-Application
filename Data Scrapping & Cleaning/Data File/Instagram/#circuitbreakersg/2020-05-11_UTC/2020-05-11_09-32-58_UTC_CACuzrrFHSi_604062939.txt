Every 11th day of the month we are celebrating our monthversarry. The husband is always taking care of me and even made breakfast & vitamins for me today. Then when I reminded him about the date, he was surprised. Definitely celebrating every month when you are married might be too overwhelming for some. But we always try to spend time together every 11th. He didnâ€™t do anything special for the occasion, because his love in action is done everyday ðŸ’•
