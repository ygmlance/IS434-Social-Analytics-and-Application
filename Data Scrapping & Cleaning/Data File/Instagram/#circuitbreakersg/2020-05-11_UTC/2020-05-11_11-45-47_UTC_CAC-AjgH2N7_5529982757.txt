Enticed by Miss Tam Chiakâ€™s post a few days ago I ordered some #koreanchickenwings #bibimbap and #jigae for #dinner from @hongdaeoppa_sg. Wasnâ€™t impressed because the chicken was really dry instead of juicy and we were hoping the wings would at least have a nice drizzle of their Gochujang sauce and Soy Garlic sauce but there was a lack of both. The other two mains lacked punch and didnâ€™t satisfy our Korean food craving. Maybe we gotta wait till CB is over and have our Korean food onsite ðŸ˜‹Day 35 of #circuitbreakersg
