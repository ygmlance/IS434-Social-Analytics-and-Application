Day 35/56‚Ä¢Stayhome Thankful
The feeling of bliss! ‚ù§‚ù§ Received homemade glutinous rice dumplings from my mum yeaterday, it's her standard procedure to make 3 types of fillings - Pork, Chicken, Vego. üòç I love her vego dumplings the most...filled with mushrooms, peanuts, chestnuts, vego pork belly! While Kbros like her chicken version which is somewhat like lor mai kai! 
Then....another homemade goodie, from MiL! She made muah chee & pack the condiments separately for us so that we can eat this anytime we want üòç we're now having it for teatime! 
I'm stuffed yet happy that both my mums are staying home & making good use of time doing things they enjoy ie: to cook!
