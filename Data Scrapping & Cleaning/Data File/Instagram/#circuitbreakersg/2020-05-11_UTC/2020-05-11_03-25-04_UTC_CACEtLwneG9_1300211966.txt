The rat race has stopped.

Times have changed.

You have probably changed or are in a transitional phase.

There’s no race to the “other end”. There’s no competition being had.

Nobody is checking to see how far you’ve come.

There are no winners. Just people getting from day to day.

Other people’s progress or achievements have no bearing on your own.

Your little steps are still steps.

No steps is also okay.

You are doing great 👍🏼
