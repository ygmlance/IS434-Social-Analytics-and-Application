Families and caregivers supporting children battling cancer may be having a much more difficult time than most, for cancer does not stop, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since these children have been unable to step out of the house since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak due to their compromised immunities, VIVA Foundation (@vivafoundation) has introduced various initiatives to support these children and keep them occupied. Swipe right to view these initiatives.
