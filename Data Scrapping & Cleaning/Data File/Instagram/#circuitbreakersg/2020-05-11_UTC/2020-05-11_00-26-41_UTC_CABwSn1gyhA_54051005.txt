1 month into the Circuit Breaker period in Singapore and we have done quite a number of art and craft projects together. That art piece pinned up was done by Arielle with paint and toilet rolls cut-outs!

We have a recycling corner of plastics, cardboards etc at home and toilet rolls are one of the items. We bring them to Arielle’s school for the teachers to recycle for the toddlers’ activities!
