Whatever-is-in-the-fridge salad: greens, blanched cauliflower and brussels sprouts, cherry tomatoes, black olives, anchovy fillets, and a dressing of EVOO, squeezed lemon, and cracked himalayan salt. Nutritious and light, this is my lunch and dinner in one as today was very busy at work!!! #salad #saladdays #homeprepared #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
