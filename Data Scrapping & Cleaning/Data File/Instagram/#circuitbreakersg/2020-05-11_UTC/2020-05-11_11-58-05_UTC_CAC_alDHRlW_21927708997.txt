Circuit breaker home cooked dinner Day1: Sweet and sour meatballs, chicken nuggets and curly fries. I didn’t take a photo of the nuggets and fries bcos I wanted to highlight my sweet and sour meatballs.🤣 I’m proud of this dish bcos I was in the middle of seasoning the meat and shaping them in balls when I was asked to zoom. Multitasking at its finest!😂 scroll down if you want to know the recipe.👇🏼

Instructions
In a mixing bowl, combine ground pork, minced onion, salt, ground black pepper, egg, and bread crumbs. Mix thoroughly.
Scoop about 1 to 2 tablespoons of mixture and form into a ball shapes. Set aside.
Pan-fry the ball-shaped mixture until the outer side turns brown.
Once done, drain the oil from the meatballs on a plate with a paper towel and set aside.

When the oil is hot enough, sauté the garlic.
Add the sliced carrot and bell peppers then cook for 2-3 minutes or until tender.
Add pineapple chunks and cook for a minute or two before adding the tomato ketchup, brown sugar, and some of the pineapple syrup then stir.
Pour-in water and let boil.
Add the cornstarch diluted in water and cook until the sauce thickens.
Put the meatballs back in the pan and coat with the sauce. Let it simmer for 2 mins. 
Serve and enjoy!
