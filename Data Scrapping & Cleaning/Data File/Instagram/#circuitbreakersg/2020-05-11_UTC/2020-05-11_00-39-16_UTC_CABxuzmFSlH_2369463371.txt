In our family, every day is a new adventure.
.

My boys are very very active, they can barely sit still and need plenty of nagging to get them to complete one task. Their idea of playing together is to wrestle against one another or jump off furnitures, even the 2 year old joins in these activities. And even if they are playing a relatively mild game like monopoly or UNO, there are bound to be arguments and fist fights.  Ibu here ends up being a referee or a she-Hulk, depending on how serious these arguments are. .

We’ve  been forced to make constant adjustments to our parenting strategies, #stayhome schedules and even kids’ rewards and punishments over the course of the #circuitbreakerSG. The more occupied the boys are, the less time they have for mischief. The more severe the punishments, the more compliant they can be. And the more attractive the rewards, the more “motivated” they get. A week later, these new strategies don’t work anymore and we are forced to invent new ones. We try and use teachable moments to impart knowledge, role model actions and regulate behaviours. .

Not everything works each time, but InsyaAllah, we will keep on learning, and adapting and improving our selves and our family. Thankful for this opportunity too.
