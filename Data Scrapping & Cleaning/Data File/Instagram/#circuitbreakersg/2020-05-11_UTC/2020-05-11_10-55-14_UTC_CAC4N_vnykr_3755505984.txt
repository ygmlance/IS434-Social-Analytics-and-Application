2 weeks later, 20 kitty portraits painted, and $440 raised for @kittensanctuary.sg! A big thank you to everyone for your tremendous support, and I hope you enjoy your little paintings :) Still in the giving mood? The Kitten Sanctuary always has little furry bellies to fill! In addition, this is clearly a critical time for our migrant workers, so do strongly consider donating to @mwcsg via giving.sg!
