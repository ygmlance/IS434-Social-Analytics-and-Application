It's been tough. As you guys know, as a home-based business I have had to pause operations during this circuit breaker period and even though F&B are allowed to start up again on May 12th, non-F&B like mine have to wait it out until June 1st.

That's why I've been a little quiet on the socials lately and I'm also sad that these little taurus pots have just been sitting here because they can't go out to any birthday babies. Sorry guys.

I'm really thankful to my customers who have been so understanding during this time even though it means a long wait until June for their orders to arrive. Plant people truly are the nicest people.

Despite the effects on me personally, I know everyone is going through some hard times whether it's financial, personal or emotional. So let's focus on the end game which is a brighter outlook soon hopefully. Keep washing your hands, safe distance and I'll keep you updated on when deliveries will be going out again ‚ù§üí™
