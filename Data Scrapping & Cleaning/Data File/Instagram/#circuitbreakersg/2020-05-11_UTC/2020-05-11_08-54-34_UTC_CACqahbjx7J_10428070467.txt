☆Complimentary Zoom Workshop☆
With every Heart In Hand Atelier Starter Kit purchased, you can redeem a free 2 hr Zoom Workshop: Introduction to Japanese Pastel Art.

Had a fruitful session with 5 ladies and it was a cosy session, in part like a gathering since they are colleagues! Such a lovely 2 hours spent learning the basic techniques of pastel art and the beautiful bookmarks created!
