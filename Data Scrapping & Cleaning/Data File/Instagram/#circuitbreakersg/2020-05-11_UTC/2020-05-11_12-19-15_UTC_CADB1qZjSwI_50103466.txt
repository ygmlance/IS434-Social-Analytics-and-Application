A+mazing Hip Opening class (06 May 20) by Master Raj. When I heard him say Hanumanasana, I told myself to embrace rather than groan. Somehow Hanumanasana sounds more motivating than front splits 😂 It is still a challenge to square my hips (missing my teacher's adjustment🙏). But looking back I'm so grateful for my progress. I look forward to the day I can raise my arms up in triumphant. And invoke the spirit of Hanuman the Monkey God. Dedication, flexibility and patience. As what yoga bro @yogomide mentioned in his recent post, the intention matters more than "the full pose". How we face challenges outside the mat. Thank you for the reminder🙏🙏 #hanumanasana #frontsplits #circuitbreakersg #sgcircuitbreaker #stayhomecovid19 #hipopeningyoga #hamstringstraining #yogaprogress #yogagratitude #yogapractice #yogainspiration #mendoyogatoo #menyoga
