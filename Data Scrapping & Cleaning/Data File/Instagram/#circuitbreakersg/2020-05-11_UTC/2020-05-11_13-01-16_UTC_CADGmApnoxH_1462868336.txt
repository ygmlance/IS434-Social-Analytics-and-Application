“Have courage and be kind” -
While Cinderella is not my favourite disney princess, this quote has inspired me through tough times in life. Many of us tend to hold back when it comes to being nice to others, in fear that they may hurt you. However, sometimes it takes great courage to treat someone with kindness — especially when that person has wronged or hurt you. It also takes great courage to be kind to yourself, knowing when to walk away from situations or people who aren’t good for you. Always remember to be kind to people around you, to strangers and most importantly, to yourself.
