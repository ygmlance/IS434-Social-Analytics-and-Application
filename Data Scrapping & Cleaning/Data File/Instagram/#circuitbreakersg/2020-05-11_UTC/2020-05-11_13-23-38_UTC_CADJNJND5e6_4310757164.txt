#circuitbreakersg : âœ¨ Mango Season âœ¨

Who else loves mango like me? Comment below... we couldnâ€™t find mangoes here this year as much as we do. So started craving for mangoes for 2 months, finally lucky enough to get the full box of Alphonso Mangoes(the best). It tastes and smells divine ğŸ˜‡. It is enriched with vitamin C, vitamin A, fiber and antioxidants, do we need anymore reason to indulge in this goodness. Thank You Universe for this delicacy ğŸ¤£. ğŸŒ·
