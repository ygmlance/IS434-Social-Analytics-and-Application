MOH may have reclassified various allied health services as essential but we are unfortunately NOT exempted. ⠀
⠀
As art therapists, we believe face-to-face sessions are crucial to both our clients and ourselves. However, with the current situation, we can only adapt and offer the next best option - which is to provide our therapy sessions online to continue supporting new and existing clients.⠀
⠀
Even so, online sessions may not be suitable for all clients due to various reasons. We have a checklist in which our clients need to satisfy before proceeding with online therapy sessions, some of the factors we considered:⠀
1) Is the client old enough to access the internet and online platform we are using without the help of an adult?⠀
2) Is there access to a safe and private space for online sessions to be carried out?⠀
3) Is the internet connection stable?⠀
4) Can clients store their artwork in a safe place to ensure confidentiality?⠀
⠀
For clients that are able to fulfil these considerations, online therapy sessions are extended to them. Also, to ensure privacy of our online therapy sessions, we use a highly secured medical platform - PlatoConnect.⠀

Here's a feedback we received recently from one of our clients who experienced our online session: ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
"Was hesitant to try out the online session at first, but the trial session went well and I do not mind carrying on online for the rest of my sessions. If privacy at home is not a concern, then there is no big difference between online session and face to face ones."⠀⠀

Our online therapy sessions include a bag of art materials to get you started on this journey with us. ⠀⠀
