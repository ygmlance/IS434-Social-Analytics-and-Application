#CircuitBreakerSG D-35

Have been hunting high & low for Spaghetti the past few weeks. Finally found some when I did my grocery shopping but not the brand that I usually buy 🤔 It's either take it or leave it! Similarly when I found Gochujang of a different brand, i quickly grab! Who knows it may taste even better, right?

Anyway, it's Meatball Spaghetti loaded with golden garlicky breadcrumbs for our Monday #lunch. Enjoy yours too!
