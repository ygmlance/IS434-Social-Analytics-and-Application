My fam and I love steamboat, so Mother’s day we decided to have steamboat again 🤣 Pretty often nowadays. 
Most of the Ingredients for steamboat is from Mr Joy’s @freshfood_mrjoy :

Broth - Beauty Collagen soup 
Shabu Shabu Pork collar and Liondance pork ball

Yong tau foo - Mini tofu puff, Fresh/Fried Taokee, Fresh Beancurd with fish paste, Fish dumpling with pork, Cuttlefish, Taiwan Taro cubes, Cheese tofu, Beancurd prawn roll & Ngoh Hiang

Premium prawn paste (we made it into mini balls 🤣) Soya ring roll 玲玲卷

It’s our second time getting fresh yong tau foo from Mr Joy’s. Their products are fresh and the fish paste is sweet. One of my favourite item is the Mini puff Taokee.

They have a beauty set which includes the Collagen soup and mix varieties of steamboat ingredients. The soup stock is easy to cook, melts instantly. 
Find out more on their IG for delivery info.
