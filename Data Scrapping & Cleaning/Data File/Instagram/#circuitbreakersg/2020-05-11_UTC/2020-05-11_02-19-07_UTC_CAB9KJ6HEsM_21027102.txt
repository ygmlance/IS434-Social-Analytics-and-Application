Four years ago. One of my most favourite events not because it was my birthday but I get to witness so many instructors, Singapore and Malaysia, from different group fitness programmes coming together and dancing as one on stage (Zumba, KpopX, Bolly Dazz, Jumpstyle, K-Kardio)! And this event wouldnt have been so successful without my participants and instructors who took up so many roles and hosted this event for me (you know who you are!). I’ll be doing a mini party this Saturday at 5:30pm with an international presenter. More details will be out at 120 Fitness SG Facebook page! Am looking forward to bring this programme virtually to you, an exclusive programme that I fell in love with when I was visiting that country. Can you guess which country i’m referring to? Let me give you some hints, I did my Bolly Dazz masterclass there and it’s one of my favourite city I would come back again and again, it starts with the letter “T”! ☺️ #birthdaybash #throwback #bestjobever #circuitbreakersg #stayathome #virtualclass
