LOWER BODY WORKOUT👇🏻⠀
All you need is a set time of dumbbells and bands. If you don’t have dumbbells, you can use water or milk bottles or go without and just use your body weight. And if you don’t have bands for the last exercise, you can also do it without. I did 4 rounds of these exercises and my legs went jelly. Toughest one for me would definitely be exercise 3. Core has to be engaged and sometime I get wobbly 😂. Have fun working out!⠀
