Day 7 Hols = Day 35 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Pistol Pull Push (Hasfit) 
#7dayhomeworkoutchallenge with #heatherrobertsoncom 
Another wet Monday morning.. So cooling (but I'm sweating like crazy still).. Wish I can crawl back to bed.. Haha.. I'll do another post about my #7dayabchallenge reflection. Today, I'm back at my strength training and a short 5 min abs session with #hasfit_official #hasfittribe #hasfit AND started on Heather Robertson's 7 day Home Challenge.. She's posting new videos everyday. Check it out! Today is extra long but tomorrow, my focus is on her! 
Have a great week ahead.. And oh, yes, I had balloons for my hubby's birthday yesterday! (if u r wondering)
