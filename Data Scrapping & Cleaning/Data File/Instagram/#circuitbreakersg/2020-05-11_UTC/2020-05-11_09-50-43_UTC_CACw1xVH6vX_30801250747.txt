We hope everyone had a great weekend yesterday with that one special female close to your heart.

As Mother's Day just passed yesterday, we would also like to take this opportunity to have everyone keep a lookout for the wellbeing of a very special group of people in Singapore- Our Seniors! They are like the mothers of Singapore, having worked really hard to shape Singapore to what it is today.

Do you know that a quarter of those infected with #covid19 in Singapore are seniors aged 60 years and above?

Here’s an article taken from @gov.sg on how we can help. Let’s do our parts to keep the seniors within our families away from harm’s reach!
