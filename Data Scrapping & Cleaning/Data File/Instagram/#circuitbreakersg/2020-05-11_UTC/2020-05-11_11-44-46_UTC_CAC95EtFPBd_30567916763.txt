#circuitbreakersg day 35

Not exactly a dinner type of food but since I have excess fillings from making the dumplings yesterday, I decided to make some 生煎包(pan fried buns) for dinner today. 🤗 .
.
.
Am pleased with myself for making 2 different dishes with the same fillings. ✌🏼 And I’m grateful for that today. #gratitudediary

Monday is almost over so give yourself a pat on the shoulders for having survived Monday because the rest of the week will be much easier! 💪🏻 😂 .
