No inspiring philosophical post today.

Here's a plate of inspired Korean Fried Chicken when you are sick of #leftoverKFC fried rice and don't know what else to do with leftover KFC!

Gochujang is as rare a commodity as Baking Powder, Cream Cheese and Vanilla Essence.

So I had to make do with what I had:

Bake or fry the leftover KFC until crispy when you touch it.

For the sauce - 
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 heaped teaspoon dao jio (Chinese bean paste. U can also use miso if you want. Just need a bean paste. If you have gochujang, win liao lor. Use it.)
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon cooking wine
1 tablespoon chilli sauce (choose the sweet spicy kind like Linghams)

Stir over low heat until it becomes gooey and sticky.

When it's done, toss in your chicken until it's coated thoroughly.

Okay time to think about what's for lunch today..... ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” #kfcsg #kfcfriedchicken #koreanfriedchickensg #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodstagram #sgfoodiary #sgfoodlovers #sgfoodinstagram
