Another first for us, delivery from @londonfatduck.sg! The duck was indeed fatty and juicy, and was nicely complemented by the other classic dishes (char siew, roast pork, 5 spice pork, signature fried rice, spinach with trio egg). We gobbled this meal down really fast! Ordered via oddle; they are also on @grabfoodsg.
