Lavender Cheese Bangkit cookies. My first batch of Raya cookies. Haven’t finished baking everything. Here’s the recipe

Sieve then following in a bowl and set aside - Tapioca Flour (3 cups)
- Corn Flour (3 cups)
- Baking powder (1 tsp)

Mix these well
- Butter (250gm)
- Sugar (1 cup)
Then add
- Cream Cheese (250gm) - Egg yolks (2)
- Vanilla Essence (1 tsp)
(mix till soft peaks)

Then add the mix (bit by bit) to the flour mixture and knead to form a dough. Continue kneading until it not longer sticks to your hands. Then add - Lavender Cheese (250gm grated)
And knead until all the cheese are well incorporated into the dough.

Use a rolling pin and cookie cutter to press out your desired shapes and bake in oven 170 deg C about 40-45 mins (I turn the pan around at halfway mark) until they’re slightly golden.
