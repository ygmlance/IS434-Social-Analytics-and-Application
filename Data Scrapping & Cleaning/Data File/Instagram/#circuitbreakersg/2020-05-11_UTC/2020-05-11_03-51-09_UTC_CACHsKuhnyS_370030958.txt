#circuitbreakersg Day 35 Fasting Day 18:

Gotta admit, during this period, every time the doorbell rings, everyone at home will be on their toes. While most of them are food deliveries, last night was a lil different. The delivery man was uniformed in yellow & red. I knew it. My lil b is here.
Locked myself in the room to enjoy the quickie unboxing. Sorry, only an Apple junkie who appreciates good packaging can understand this significance.
Thanks to a buddy who made this transaction happen. You know you  and ur gf are awesome beings.
