Other than Korean food, we also ordered Chinese set menu.
My favourite dishes was the Truffle Roasted Chicken & Dong Po Rou with Mei Cai.
✅Truffle Roasted Chicken
- Can really taste truffle in the tender chicken meat and on top of it, it is served with minced chicken truffle sauce. Even more truffle goodness! 😍
✅Dong po rou
- I always loved dong po rou because the meat is so tender melt in you mouth kind. Ooo and I love mei cai. Theirs was perfect and too salty. 👍
✅Peppercorn prawn
- The fresh peppercorns are so interesting. It’s like mini grapes that pops in your mouth but the peppery taste is not too spicy yet you know it’s pepper. 🤔 The prawn head very tasty and juicy also! 
This is only my first serving of course I had more after. 🤪
