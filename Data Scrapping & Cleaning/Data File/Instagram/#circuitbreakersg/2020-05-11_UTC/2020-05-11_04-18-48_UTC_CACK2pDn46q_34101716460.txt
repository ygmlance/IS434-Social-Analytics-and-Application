#pastaCarbonara is one of the simplest to make pasta but also the most difficult to master. I had to use 200% effort to make sure that my #penne was still al dente and that my egg and cheese mixture did not scramble. My brother loved it so I would consider this a success. It is traditionally made with guanciale/ pancetta/bacon but I don’t eat any of these, so I swapped that out and added one finely diced #johnsonvillesausage instead. I also used a 3:1 ratio for the sauce - beating three table spoons of freshly grated #parmesan to one egg. You could use 2 egg yolks instead of one whole egg for extra creaminess. Before serving, I seasoned it with mixed herbs and a lot of black pepper. (No salt was added throughout because the sausage and cheese already had a lot of salt and flavour)👩🏻‍🍳 #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
