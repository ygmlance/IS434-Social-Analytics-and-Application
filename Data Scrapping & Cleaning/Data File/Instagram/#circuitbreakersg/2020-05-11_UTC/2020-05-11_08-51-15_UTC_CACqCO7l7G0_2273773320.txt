| #throwback | vietnamese bánh mì
My favourite kind of sandwich really, with elements that I truly like. Since overseas travel is now out of the question, I decided I'd try to make one.
.
My D-I-Y Vietnamese Bánh Mì consists of:
• crusty french baguette • salmon pâté • mayo aioli • smoked duck breast and kurobuta ham • carrot • cucumber • pickled daikon • mint • coriander • rucola • french butter • fresh-cut chilli & tangy nuoc cham sauce • (not pictured)
.
When I was in Vietnam, I could eat almost two Bánh Mì everyday, even after having the hotel's international buffet breakfast. Missing it so much, having my #homemade one is a great consolation.
.
To enjoy together with really strong Ca Phe Sua Da, which is Vietnamese iced milk coffee freshly brewed with a traditional phin coffee filter, souvenirs from our Ho Chi Minh holiday.
.
The #homemade Bánh Mì turned out quite on point. Guess I'll be seeing more of this one.
