Dinner this evening, was a reheated, defrosted Oxtail Soup that was made on 7th April. Accompanying it were a couple of sides of kimchi, one was radish, or Kkakdugi Kimchi, and the other was young radish, or Yeolmu Kimchi. Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #oxtailsoup #sopbuntut #kkakdugikimchi #yeolmukimchi #bibigokimchi #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #reheatedmeals #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
