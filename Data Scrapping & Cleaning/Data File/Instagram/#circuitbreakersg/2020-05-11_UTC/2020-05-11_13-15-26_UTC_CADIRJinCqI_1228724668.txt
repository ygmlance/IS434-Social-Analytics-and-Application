Utilising both @peatix and Zoom waiting rooms are a great way to screen attendees. 
Clearly communicate the event login instructions in the Peatix ‘Event Description’ as well as in the ‘Additional Notes’ section when creating your event.

It is important to state that attendees NEED to ensure their Zoom names indicate their name and/or organisation as reflected in the @peatix form to be granted access into the event. [Example]: Nicholas Gerard - Peatix

Once you have verified their names and identity you can proceed to add them into the call
