*The lockdown hair-raising experience*

When the duration of the lockdown becomes more apparent while looking at a slow-mo video of your kid 😅! Hair wash has been a kind of nightmare, and combing them not exactly a breeze, still, I made peace with the whole ordeal for the sake of those curls. And just when that crop got to its glorious best, the salons in #Singapore are ready to resume snipping. That's one lockdown by-product I'm certainly going to miss ❤. Or maybe not 😬😅. #curls #hairstyles #hair #hairsalon #curlyhair #lockdown #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #ShivInDaHouse
