PEACHY BOOTY WORKOUT.⠀
⠀
After celebrating Mother’s Day yesterday, I need to burn all the sweets 🧇 🍰 🍨 my kids (actually, my hubby) prepared for me. I decided to do some booty 🍑 workout. I am not blessed in that area and have never really concentrated on working on that part of my body until now. So hopefully I’ll start seeing some results. I did 4 rounds of these exercises. I did them slowly and was more deliberate in my movements. Get ready for the 3rd exercise. It’s a killer. Enjoy!⠀
