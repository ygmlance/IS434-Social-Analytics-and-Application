Before the circuit breaker started, I was working on a project about frontline and essential workers. Titled “Portraits of Hope”, my intention was to share a light amidst this chaos we’ve found ourselves in and be reminded that there are others fighting alongside us, for us. We practised social distancing and wore masks during the shoots, but it was important to me that we could see the faces of the people that were photographed. Over the next few days I will be sharing more of the portraits, and a little caption about the people featured. The project was supported by @mccysg and co-produced with @helloepiphany and assisted by Zhixiang.

Pictured above is SBS bus captain Lee Chong Nyen, who continues his work despite the COVID-19 pandemic. When we met, it was just moments after PM Lee Hsien Loong announced that the country was going into circuit breaker. In fact, he had been listening to the speech on his phone outside our little mobile studio. I asked him if he was concerned. He shrugged and said that he believed we were in good hands and that he would be reporting to work as long as he was needed.
