Been eating too much and moving too little this past month, and especially too much junk food & pastries! What a different pregnancy this has been... I still remember the water retention in my legs & relatively swollen face for my last pregnancy, luckily it seems better this time round! 🤰🏻
Swipe for makeup deets! 🥰
