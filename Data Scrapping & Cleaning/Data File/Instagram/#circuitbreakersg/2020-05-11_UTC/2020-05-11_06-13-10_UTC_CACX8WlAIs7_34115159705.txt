Not all burger patties are made equal. Yes, the juicy, meaty ones are ultra delicious but your opinion might change once you’ve given VeganBurg a try. This is a 100% plant-based vegan “fast-food” restaurant serving up huge meat-free burgers that not only looks like the real deal, but are also really great in taste. It’s the ultimate vegan comfort food that everyone will love. .
