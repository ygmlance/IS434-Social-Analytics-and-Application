#stayhome RECIPE: This simple Chinese dish of silky scrambled eggs luxuriating in tomato gravy is pure comfort food. Mine is a souped up version of the rather light-tasting classic dish as I prefer a sharper punch of tomatoes (I used cherry tomatoes for more intensity) and vinegar in the sauce. It’s a little like the piquant gravy draping sweet-and-sour pork. Recipe adapted from Meat Men (last pic in the video shows an earlier version I cooked according to their recipe). ……………………………………………….................STIR-FRIED EGGS & TOMATOES RECIPE

Serves 2 …………………………………………….....................Ingredients:

5 small or 4 big eggs

½ tsp salt

pepper, to taste

1 big clove garlic, chopped

3 stalks spring onion, chopped

270g cherry tomatoes, halved

4 tbsp ketchup (plus 1 tsp tomato paste, if you have it - otherwise, add slightly more ketchup to taste)

50ml water

light soy sauce, to taste

2 tsp sugar 
a dash of white/rice vinegar, to taste 
1 tsp cornflour mixed with 2 tbsp water ………………………………………………………... Method: 
Whisk eggs with ½ tsp salt & pepper. Heat some oil in a pan over medium heat.

Add garlic, half the chopped spring onions & all the tomatoes. Stir-fry for a min.

Add ketchup (& tomato paste if using). Stir.

Add 50ml water & simmer for 30 sec. Season with soy sauce, sugar & vinegar.  Thicken sauce with cornflour mixture. Dish out & set aside.

In a clean wok, heat 2 tbsp oil over medium heat.

Pour in egg mixture.

Using a spatula, nudge eggs that’ve set at the edges to the centre until no liquid remains (don’t overcook!). Add tomato mixture & mix quickly (don’t mash up egg too much). Taste & adjust seasoning with more ketchup/soy sauce/vinegar/sugar if necessary.

Garnish with remaining chopped spring onions & serve.
