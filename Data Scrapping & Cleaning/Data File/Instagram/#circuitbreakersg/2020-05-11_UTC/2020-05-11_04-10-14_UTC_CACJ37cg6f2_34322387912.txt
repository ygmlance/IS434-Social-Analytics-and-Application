晓薇的这幅画，应该钤上一枚《社交距离前所作》的印章。此画人群环绕的意境取自本地两位作家 - 梁文福与陈志锐 - 的诗作。⁣

A seal inscribed with ‘Painted before social distancing’ would be ideal for Seow Wei’s painting. The theme of humans circling and bypassing each other are derived from from two poems by Singaporean writers Liang Wern Fook and Tan Chee Lay, ⁣
