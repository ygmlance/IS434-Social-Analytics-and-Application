Happy Mother's Day to all mummies!! How was your Mother's Day celebration yesterday? Ours felt like a usual stay-home day made special with cards and a handmade bracelet by the kids but that is sufficient to make me happy. ‚ù§ This year's celebrations must have felt different as we are all confined to our homes. We eagerly wait for the day when we can break free and lead normal lives again. While we wait, let's treasure our loved ones and simple joys in life. ü•∞
