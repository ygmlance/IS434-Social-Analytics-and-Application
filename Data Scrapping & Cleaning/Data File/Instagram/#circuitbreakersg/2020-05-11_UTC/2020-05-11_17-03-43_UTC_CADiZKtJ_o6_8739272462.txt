Day 37

These last few weeks I've been  holding private mindfulness meditation sessions, as an experienced but still learning meditator. It's been a pleasure and a solace to hold these quiet circles of self care and practice.

It is a way to contribute to the wellbeing of my friends. It's a way of giving back to the community the kindness I have received from others. 
It's a way to practice something I enjoy and go deeper into my understanding of it. One of my teachers says you only truly understand something when you teach it with something new that you have discovered. I find that exploring and designing how I am going to share my experience with others helps me go deeper.

Today's suggestion for you is to think about doing a simple skill share with some friends or even the general public. It will help you engage in something other than the routine, provide a little variety, and keep the passion for something you love alive. If you are an entreprenuer, like I am, it could even help your business.

Above all, be safe and well.
