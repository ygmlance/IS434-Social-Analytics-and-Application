Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 35:
After a long day of meal prep for the week, I was too tired to whip something up for dinner. Took inspiration from Korean bbq wraps by replacing the bbq meat with salmon sashimi. That's how we ended up with DIY wraps for dinner - salmon sashimi and radish kimchi wrapped in coral lettuce.

I know most people have sashimi with wasabi and soy sauce but I really enjoy having it with kimchi! I even dip the salmon sashimi in kimchi juice when I'm out of kimchi!
