Supper time! The surprise came right after i came out from shower last night! Wet hair, no makeup, some more in my PJ..have to put on the hairband so i don't look messy! But luckily the lighting helped to cover up all the flaws on my face. 
Thank you my Dearest Nick Goh for getting cake for me on Mother's Day! Thank you Sweetie Summer Goh for writing the words on the cake and thanks my Little Ocean for making me a hot tea! **unglam but must post to show my appreciation to my 3 宝贝s
