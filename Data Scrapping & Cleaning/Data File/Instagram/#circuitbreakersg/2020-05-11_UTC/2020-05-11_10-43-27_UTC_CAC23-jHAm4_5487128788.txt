Circuit Breaker Day 35 // Yesterday's lunch. Didn't feel like eating rice and was craving for kway chap, so I decided to serve my braised pork with hor fun (rice noodles).
.
Now that most of us are working from home, and the boundary between work and off work is blurred, I somehow find my hours stretch longer compared to working in office. 🙋

病毒阻斷措施第35天 // 昨天的午餐。不想吃飯，所以改以寬粿條（河粉，類似板條）配滷肉。換換口味也不錯。
.
過去一個多月改為在家辦公，感覺少了上班下班的儀式感後，工作和私生活的界限模糊了，反倒覺得有時花在工作的時間更長了。
