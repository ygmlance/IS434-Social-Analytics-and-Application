It takes time and a lot of determination to build a strong and solid foundation. I am fortunate to be living in a country where my forefathers have chosen a strong team of leaders who have the grit and determination to bring us through the good and bad times. Leaders who put it upon themselves for the good of our community. And at times like this, when the world is critising us about our handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, our leaders stay resilient to ensure we overcome the crisis, never once blaming on any situation or any administration.
.
We need more leaders like these to bring us out of the crisis and the serious economic impact which will be hitting our generation and our future generations. This is the same for managing a country and any business. The Covid-19 pandemic has and will shape a new group of leadership. If you are in the position for power and authority, think again. Our generations will require a new league of leaders who would take it upon themselves to inspire, guide and lead us through the series of obstacles ahead.
