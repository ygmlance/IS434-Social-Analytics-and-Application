Today is the world Kuffieh day (May 11) which is a day to show solidarity with the Palestinian cause and struggle.

I'm borrowing my inspiration for this post from @cakes_stencils of his artwork that he created to celebrate this occasion with a stencil of Jesus in Kuffieh on a wall in Bethlehem a walk away from the Church of Nativity.
