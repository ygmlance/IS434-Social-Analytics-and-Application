We're having Steamed Chicken Rice for dinner tonight. The chicken üçó is so tender & the rice üçö flavorful.

Marinated the chicken thigh overnight with Salt & Pepper and some Dark Soya Sauce on the skin to make it more appealing (optional). Added some Water, Chinese Cooking Wine, Ginger slices & Spring Onion to a steaming wok and Chicken thigh on the steaming rack. Brought it to a boil and simmered for 25 mins. Let the steaming liquid cool down to room temperature & added some salt to cook rice with it.

Made the chilli sauce using chilli padi, garlic, ginger, lime, salt, sugar, sesame oil & hot water.

Complete the meal with stir-fried Broccoli ü•¶ & pickled Cucumber ü•í. An easy dinner without having the taste compromised.

Enjoy your #dinner too!
