Porridge

I like porridge because it is always comforting and easy to make. I could have multiple variations of porridge and this is one of them
üìùThis is more flavorful because I add half century egg and half salted egg
üìùI also make use of leftover pork ribs from soup to make it tastes nicer. One great way to make use of your leftover pork ribs from soup is to take out all the meat from pork ribs, mince it then add salt, pepper and soya sauce to keep for soup or porridge
üìùI like hongkong style porridge that‚Äôs really watery. So will use rice and water ratio of 1:10

Ingredients: 1 cup of rice, 2 potatoes, half carrot, mince pork ribs, half salted egg, half century egg, spring onion

1Ô∏è‚É£Cut potato and carrot into small pieces, boil in water with 1 cup of rice.
2Ô∏è‚É£Boil with mid fire without cover (because I hate cleaning overflow) for 30 minutes
3Ô∏è‚É£Turn to low fire and continue for another 30 minutes, with half-closed cover
4Ô∏è‚É£I use 1 teaspoon of Japanese scallop broth from @9sseafood for flavor and it is really GOOD. If not, you can use 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 table spoon of soya sauce. Put more soya sauce according to your flavor.
5Ô∏è‚É£Add minced pork ribs, minced salted egg and century egg. Cook for a while until it is slightly boiled.
6Ô∏è‚É£Ready to serve with thinly minced spring onion
