Grateful to @thesunshinenation for the shout-out. A lovely surprise to start the week! Thank you! ðŸ’—

I'm offering Tarot readings on FACEBOOK LIVE tomorrow, Tues 12 May from 8-10 pm (SST: GMT+8). Each ticket you buy entitles you to a one-question reading! All proceeds go to Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), an organisation that cares for the rights and well-being of migrant workers in Singapore.
