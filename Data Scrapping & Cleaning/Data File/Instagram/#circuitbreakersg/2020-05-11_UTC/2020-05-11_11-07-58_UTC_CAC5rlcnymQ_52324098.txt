Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday.
.
And if that doesnâ€™t work, let my bowl of Threadfin Porridge bring us comfort.
.
I marinated my slice Threadfin with sesame oil and my special sauce, @kwongwohhingsaucefactory light sauce.
.
In a pot, I fried ginger & Ikan Billis (dried anchovies). Then added washed rice, raw peanuts & water to boil. Once the porridge is done, I added the slice fish on the top of the porridge, covered the pot and let it gently simmer for 10mins.
.
Garnish with slice Spring Onions, Red Chillies, fried Onions and a drizzle of KWH light sauce to finish it off.
