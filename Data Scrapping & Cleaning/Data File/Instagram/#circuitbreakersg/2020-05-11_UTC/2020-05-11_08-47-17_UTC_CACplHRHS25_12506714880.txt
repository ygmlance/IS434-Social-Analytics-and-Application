During lockdown it will be difficult to find plumber to repair your leaking faucet. The best way is to roll up your sleeves, work out your biceps and triceps and put the new faucet in place. Of cos getting the right tools as well. And most importantly turn off the valve before you start the repair or else you will be having a manmade rainshower at home.
