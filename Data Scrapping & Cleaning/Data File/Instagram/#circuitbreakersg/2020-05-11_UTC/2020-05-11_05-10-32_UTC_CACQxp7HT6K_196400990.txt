Breakfast today, was Butter Mushroom Fried Rice! Today i tried something different, sweating minced garlic in butter, adding beaten eggs, then refrigerated leftover rice before the eggs were set. This was mixed well, and the sauteed mushrooms with onions from yesterdayâ€™s burger were added, along with a sprinkling of salt. This was tossed well, and when it was almost done, the fire was turned off, and chopped spring onions, a nob of butter and a liberal sprinkling of freshly ground Kampot red peppercorns, were folded into the fried rice. Tasty and satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #buttermushroomfriedrice #friedrice #friedriceparadise #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbreakfast #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
