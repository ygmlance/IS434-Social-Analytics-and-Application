💭 Why I did a rainbow durian cake? Because we will rise higher than Covid and the gloom we are in, and emerge even more colourful than we will ever be. We must. ⁣
⁣
🙏🏻 Sending love and light with this bake, because I know, there is a rainbow of hope after each pandemonium we ride through - if we work together and be positive. ⁣

Love, ♥️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🤍⁣
