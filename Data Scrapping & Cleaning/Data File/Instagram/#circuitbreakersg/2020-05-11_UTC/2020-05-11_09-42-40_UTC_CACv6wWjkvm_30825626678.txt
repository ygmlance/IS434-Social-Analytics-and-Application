The whole of Singapore, myself included, has been baking a lot more during the circuit breaker. Has anyone noticed how much more waste is generated from every tear of kitchen towels, aluminium foil, ziploc bags & plastic cling wraps?

We’ve been in contact with our supplier for a long time now and 100% NZ made bees wax wraps are finally coming your way. These pretty, reusable food-grade wraps is the eco-friendly option for us.
