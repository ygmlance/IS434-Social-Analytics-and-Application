Our poems by @ayecaptain93 and @fiftypaperairplanes this week feature symphonies in the dawn of silence and catalogues of blanks. April has been the quietest month and we have tried to capture this in words. Let us know in the comments if there are topics you would like to see featured in our poetry!
