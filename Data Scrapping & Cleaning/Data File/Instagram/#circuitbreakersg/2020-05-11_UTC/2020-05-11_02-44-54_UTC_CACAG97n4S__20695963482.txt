Do you think so? Can it be this simple?

It’s straightforward but certainly not easy. We operate from the stories in our minds, filtering from our vision what does not fit the stories. Blindspots occur, delaying or even outrightly preventing us from seeing new solutions and pathways, until we uncover them. Through perseverance one could uncover such blindspots, solo. But the wicked thing about it is, how do we look for something that we don’t even know is there? This is the value of having a professional coach - someone who has your back by pointing out stuff that is simply not perceivable by yourself.
