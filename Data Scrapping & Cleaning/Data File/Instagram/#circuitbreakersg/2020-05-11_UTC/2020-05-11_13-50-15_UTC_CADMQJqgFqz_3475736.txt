Day 35 of circuit breaker, I had homemade dough for Leodys to play with. Just use plain flour, water and food colouring. At first I wanted to buy play doh for him but very scare that he will eat it. So put my heart into making dough for him. Play dough is a very good sensory play for toddler as it will enhance their finger strength and increase their creativity. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #homemadedough #playdough #diydough #toddleractivities #hbl #homebasedlearning #sensoryplay #sensoryplayideas #wfh #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
