Things to do with the kids #52

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Titus, come on. You can't stay in bed all day." "Says who?" "We'll it's not good for the soul." "Cats don't have souls, Vanilla. You've been watching YouTube again." "No, I haven't." "Well, I'm staying in bed. This whole #stayathome #circuitbreaker thing is overwhelming." "Titus, would you like to talk about it?" "Why?" "Because it's good to talk." "I tried, but she told me to shush." "Yes, Titus, but that was because it was 5.26am." "I know, I get the urge to talk at that time." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
