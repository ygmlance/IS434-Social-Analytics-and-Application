Today self affirmation: I can achieve what I want and I am the one to decide how I want it.
.
Today marks the 21st day of my self challenge headstand. It looks quite impossible to me at the first time until I decided to try it out since I am stuck at home in this circuit breaker 😆. Have been practicing every day on my focus, arm and core strength for 21 days.... .

Today is my first time be able to extend both of my legs upward and (marginally) hold for 3 seconds!! 🤩 I know my posture is not perfect and that’s the reason I can’t hold longer but that’s definitely a great learnings! (I am actually surprised I can hold that one leg up for so long when it is not straight 😅)
.
I believe everyone of us has our own pace, someone get it faster while someone take a bit longer. As long as we focus on our own process, learnings and development, we will get to where we want!
.

Hope you never give up easily on what you want as your success may come in the next time when you just try one more time ❤️
