For many weeks, parents received story summary to tell their kids for Sunday school
.
Was tied down and totally spent by work for weeks and that was about all I could do
.
Then a kid wondered if she would see me soon and that prompted me to work on something
.
A’s sch hols came so she offered to work on the slides and play the tune of “Jesus loves me”, Boom will colour the craft, pack the mail and crab will figure out how to do the zoom recording
.
The end product was sent to parents on Sat.  Thanks to @sharinpoy for sharing Chloe’s hope to see me and @rinating encouragement on how God will multiply my meagre 5 loaves and 2 fish
.
Our family had a joyful time labouring together for God and it’s definitely a very precious memory for cb
.
Thank God for not overlooking the little physical and mental energy I had and on the contrary multiplied it for His glory.  With Him, I’m always enough
