I seriously love chilli crab that I could eat every week. The best chilli crabs are definitely found in Singapore! Really miss crab eating at @jumboseafoodsg at Demsey branch. Singapore is definitely the best place in the world to find a great variety of tasty food. Things you do when you stay home.üëç #stayhomeforsg #stayhome #imstayinghome #fightcovid19 #foodie #food #foodporn #chillicrab #crabs #seafoodlover #crablover #foodphotography #sgfood #sgfoodie #singapore #covid19 #sgunited #combatcovid19 #asia #circuitbreakersg @sg.united
