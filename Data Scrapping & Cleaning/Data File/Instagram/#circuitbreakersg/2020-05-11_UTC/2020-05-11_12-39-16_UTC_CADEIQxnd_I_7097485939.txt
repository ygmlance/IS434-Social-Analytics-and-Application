PANEL:
Social Safe Distancing and the Impacts on Our Mental Health
May 16, 3:30pm
Being socially isolated have the potential of aggravating one’s mental health, particularly for persons with pre-existing conditions. With reduced socialisation, some may feel increasingly suffocated as they struggle to find a space or an outlet to release these distresses. For some others, having physical connection is therapeutic in itself – but circumstances may not always allow for it. In this panel discussion, we will discuss how “safe distancing” measures can affect the mental health of individuals, and how we can find alternative ways of connecting with, and looking out for, one another. We will also critically examine the importance of gazetting non-pharmacological mental health services as essential services in a crisis such as this. Lastly, we will look at some of the lessons and takeaways - and how can we can tap on it to build a more resilient community.
