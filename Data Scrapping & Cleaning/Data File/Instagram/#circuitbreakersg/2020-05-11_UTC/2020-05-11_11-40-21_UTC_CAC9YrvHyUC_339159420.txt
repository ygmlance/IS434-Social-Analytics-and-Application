#Circuitbreakersg Day 35
.
Paintings in the sky
.
I don't get to see the actual sun set from where I am, but it doesn't stop me from enjoying the hues of the lit up sky as the sun sets
.
The palette of colours ðŸŽ¨ blend almost effortlessly, creating a masterpiece that changes continuously
.
Ending my day feeling Blessed & Thankful
