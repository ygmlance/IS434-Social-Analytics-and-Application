#circuitbreakersg day 35 
My favourite Orh kueh (Yam cake) 🥰 Can you believe it’s only $2 for a pack and it can fill your stomach. I usually have this for lunch/dinner before the covid starts😒😞 This stall is well loved by elderlies and i know aunties who like to go to chinatown to queue for this orh kueh for hi tea. So glad there’s delivery available during this circuit breaker. 
Everything is good tbh. The Chee Cheong fan and Yam cake is soft and the sauce 👍🏻⭐️. Bundle set:
