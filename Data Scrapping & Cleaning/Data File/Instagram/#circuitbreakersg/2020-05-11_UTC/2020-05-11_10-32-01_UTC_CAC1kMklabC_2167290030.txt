DAY 35 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
Mango Coconut Delight

Same dessert that I made yesterday. I had set it in 3 different ways. One of my boys was not home yesterday, so kept aside this one for him. 
Sharing the recipe with you today.
In a mould of your choice, place mango pieces at the bottom and pour agar agar jelly, enough to cover the layer of mango. **Prepare the agar agar as per the instructions on the packet as it gives you the correct proportion. Pour it when its still warm, but not hot. It sets very quickly, so do not wait for it to cool completely. Add food colour of your choice if it does not have a colour already. Once poured, keep the mould in the fridge for the jelly to set. 
Whip 1.5 cups of cream till it forms soft peaks. Mix 3-4 drops of vanilla essence, and 4 tbsp of icing sugar, and 2 teaspoons of melted gelatine to it.
 Give it a quick whip one last time to mix everything.
Divide into two parts. 
To one part, add 1/2 cup of grated tender coconut, mix it into the cream gently, and pour on top of the jelly layer in the mould. Flatten it out a little. Put it back into the fridge to set. 
Gently mix in 3/4 cup of mango pulp to the second part of whipped cream.
Pour on top of the coconut layer. 
Leave it in the fridge for 4-5 hours to set well. *I used gelatine to set the cream because I used regular cream. I am trying to avoid going out too far off to my regular store to buy whipping cream. Use a good quality whipping cream. Then u dont need gelatine. 
I had some extra agar agar after pouring into the mould, so I put some chia seeds in it and set it. Thats the top layer I used for garnish. You can add a layer of granola too if you like.
