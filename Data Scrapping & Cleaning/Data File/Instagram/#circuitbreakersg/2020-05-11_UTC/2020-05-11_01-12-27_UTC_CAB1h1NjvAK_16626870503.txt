Packing a full breakfast in a muffin tin is a quick breakkie fix 😊 ⁣
⁣
I normally try to avoid pan frying of bacon as the whole kitchen gets really oily with oil splatter and all. ⁣
⁣
So I lined a slightly greased muffin tin with bacon. Pop into oven for 5 mins at 200DC.⁣
⁣
Removed muffin tin, crack the egg in and add some Brazilian spinach and basil as well as grated cheese.⁣
⁣
Back into oven for another 10mins at 200DC.⁣
⁣
Remove from oven and top it off with extra feta cheese, ground paprika and some chilli flakes. Done! ⁣
⁣
Let’s feed our loved ones with the best!⁣
