“I was absolutely thrilled to guest edit this month’s @homeanddecor_sg magazine. Writing the articles from home, during CB, gave me a whole new perspective and reinforced my belief in the power of the home. I share my icons from the past and discuss how science will transform the design industry in the future, especially in a post - COVID world. If you can’t get out to pick up a copy, you can read it at www.magzter.com, @mobilemagzter. Enjoy!” Nikki Hunt ✨
