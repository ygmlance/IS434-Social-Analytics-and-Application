Hank Mobley - Workout, 1961. This is probably my favourite Blue Note cover. Thereâ€™s Hank wondering why Miles thinks he is a lightweight. He shows none of that on this album and backed by a stellar quartet this album is smokin from start to end. Hank gets better and better. Certainly one of the best hardbop albums from the era.  #hankmobley #workout #grantgreen #paulchambers #wyntonkelly #phillyjoejones #bluenoterecords
