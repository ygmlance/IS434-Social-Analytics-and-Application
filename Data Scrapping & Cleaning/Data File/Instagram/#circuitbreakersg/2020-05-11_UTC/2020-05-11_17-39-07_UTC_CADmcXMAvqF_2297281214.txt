Shared a delish Fuji apple and some strawberries with @iamivanlau tonight... I kinda miss frolicking through the fruit section at the supermarket and the outdoor markets... I used to spend time checking out all the exotic Asian fruits that we don't get back in Oz... Nowadays, it's just buy and leave with no frolicking allowed... Oh, how I miss the good ol' days... Hoping for sweeter days soon... 🙏🏻😊❤️
