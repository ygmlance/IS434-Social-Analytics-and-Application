Supposedly we are in Japan 🇯🇵 Fukuoka now, but due to Covid-19, we can’t travel anymore.

Nevertheless we still miss our favourite Japanese foods, especially the sushi and sashimi 🍣hence we ordered our favourite Japanese Omakase foods to have Japan feel.

Highly recommend @toriosg this Omakase bento 🍱 for takeaway or delivery for Japanese food lovers like us. 
Do check it out their menu on their page.
