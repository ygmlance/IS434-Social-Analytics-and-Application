Think I should have taken off the mask because this was pretty strenuous 😅

These are deep handstand pushups - dipping down until the shoulders are in line with the hands. You can't do these on flat ground, so a ledge or parallel bars/parallelettes are the only way. I haven't gotten around to trying these on the latter, so I make use of ledges that I come across to perform this exercise.

Once you're comfortable with handstand pushups on a flat surface, you can give these a go. They are a great way to add variety to your handbalancing work. But be careful, you may suffer a "sudden death" moment like I did in the second video when you tire out haha. ⁣

Stay safe, but stay strong! 💪🏼
