Day 35 - #circuitbreakersg
🦐
Back to cooking! Today made Cereal Prawns and the children like it. Cooking other types of vegetable instead of cabbage too.
🥘
Last week we had curry chicken with Mantou and it is pretty awesome too. Maybe can skip the rice and just dip bread or bun with the curry next time. 👩‍🍳
