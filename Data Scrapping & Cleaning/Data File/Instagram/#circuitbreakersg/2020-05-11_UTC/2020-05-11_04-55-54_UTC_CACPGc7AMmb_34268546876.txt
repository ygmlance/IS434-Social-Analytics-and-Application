Serving premium thin-crust pizzas at affordable prices, from the heartlands in Hougang.

Handmade with nothing less than the best, we've collaborated with chefs across Japan, Italy and France to create a unique recipe of milky avocado and creamy tomato doughs and pâte feuilletée crust that are bursting with flavour. Blended into the crust are five different cheeses – mozzarella, gruyere, cheddar orange, parmesan and emmental. Talk about going OVERLY CHEEZY!
