COVID-19: Safe Management measures for workplaces
Some economic activities will gradually resume as local transmission numbers fall ↘️ 👩‍💻 Staff should telecommute from home wherever possible 🗒️ Businesses allowed to resume operations must:
- Implement safe management systems
- Ensure safe distancing - Stagger work/break hours - Have shift/split team arrangements 
_with no cross deployment across teams_
- Adopt contact tracing requirements - Ensure masks are worn
- Implement health checks - Manage potential/confirmed cases

Action will be taken against errant employers (eg. cessation of operations) ❌ Tighter measures may be introduced if above are not well-implemented
