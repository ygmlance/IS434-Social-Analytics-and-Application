Day 11 of #30DaysOfMeditation | The past few days have been a blur. My mind was overwhelmed with the news of the Airbnb layoffs and trying to meditate amidst all of that was hard. So hard. I could feel myself getting frustrated as my mind wandered all over and I kept having to pull myself back to the breath.

As difficult as it was, it’s also a reminder why practicing mindfulness is so important. Meditation has always been an irregular practice for me and I usually only do it when I feel like it. I’m realising now the importance of making it a daily habit to condition my mind.

In other news, I’m missing nature a lot and the peacefulness of it all — hence the first picture of the mountains. In reality though, I’m just sitting on my bed, in my PJs, attempting to reach a state of serenity amidst the craziness of urban life. 💆🏻‍♀️
