Sikkander’s Briyani is an Indian food stall located on the second floor of Taman Jurong Food Centre.

This stall is known for its cheap chicken briyani that sells for just $3.50.

It came with spiced basmati rice, fried chicken, archar (pickled vegetables), and a small bowl of curry.

The briyani rice was quite fragrant, though the portion was slightly less than usual briyanis due to the lower price.

The curry was decent and went nicely with the rice. The archar bordered on being tasteless.

The fried chicken skin and batter bits were not very crispy, but at least the chicken meat was quite tender and juicy.

As they say, you get what you pay for. I’ve definitely had better chicken briyani, but for $3.50 this wasn’t half bad.
