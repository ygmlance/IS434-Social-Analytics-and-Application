Extra Cheap Meatloaf & Mash || Meals for $1 or Less
———
I tried something a bit crazy. I took a prison recipe, and then made it even cheaper, because I didn't have enough meat. This dish is based on Chef John's (Food Wishes) Prison-Style Meatloaf, which is cheap because it incorporates a lot more breadcrumbs that is normally found in Meatloaf. More breadcrumbs = Less Meat. But, I didn't have enough minced meat, or any other meat for that matter, so I added a mix of dried kidney beans and dried black eyed beans.

By the way, two tips for you:
1) canned beans aren't worth the money, and
2) parboil your beans before adding them to the recipe so that they'll be cooked right through.

Beans are far cheaper protein than meat, and when cooked, can be mashed slightly to form the glue that holds this whole dish together. I served mine with pesto mashed potatoes, but you can serve it with regular mashed potato, rice or even bread.

Total Cost for 4 portions: $3.40
Minced beef = $1.58
Breadcrumbs = $1.06
Dried Beans = $0.30
Tomato Ketchup = $0.30
Herbs & Spices = $0.20
Or $0.85 per pax.
Add on some toast bread, rice or mashed potato and it'll come up to about $1 per pax.

By the way, instead of mashing your potato with butter and milk, try Olive Oil. It's lighter, cheaper, it gives the mash a delicious Mediterranean flair!
