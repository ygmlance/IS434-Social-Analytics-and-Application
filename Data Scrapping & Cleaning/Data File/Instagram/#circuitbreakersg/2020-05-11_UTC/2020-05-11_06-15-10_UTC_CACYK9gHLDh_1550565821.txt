Huge congratulations to New Zealand for being the first nation to effectively eliminate the coronavirus pandemic within its borders after a month of lockdown, and will see strict social measures ease from this Thursday! That's certainly cause for celebration and demands the opening of a nice bottle of wine, say like the @ata_rangi Martinborough Pinot Noir? Hopefully Singapore follows in New Zealand's footsteps soon.
