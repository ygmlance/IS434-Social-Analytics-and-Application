Really loving the scent I created with @maison21g just before the circuit breaker. The scent, named B, is a blend of amber, bergamot and ginger which smells great as a body perfume and as a room scent. 
Check out maison21g.com to create your own personalised scent during this circuit breaker. You donâ€™t have to smell bad while staying at home! ðŸ˜›
