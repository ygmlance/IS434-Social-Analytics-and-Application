The best way to start a brand new week is to have a heart full of love and a tummy full of sweet treats. 
It’s so lovely to have friends thinking about us and sending us treats during circuit breaker. Indeed, a sweet friendship refreshes the soul. Or perhaps our friends just want us to grow fat with them during circuit breaker 🤭 Nah... it’s to support local businesses and keep the economy going. There’s still much love and kindness in this world. .
