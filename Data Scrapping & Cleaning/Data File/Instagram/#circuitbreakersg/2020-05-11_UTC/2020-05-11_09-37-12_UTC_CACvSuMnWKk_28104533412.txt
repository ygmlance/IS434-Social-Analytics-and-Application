How was Mother's Day yesterday ? It's been great on my end! Started with e a working morning with virtual viewing, followed by ME time with family!
Today the start of the week with clouds and showers of blessings! and YES had to share what my banker fren shared about the "no penalty" during lock-in package.
.
With the past weeks of sharing, hope you have a better understanding and which is a better option for you. As always, happy to share.
.
Gentle reminder, once your loan facility is out of lock-in, do review your rates and whether repricing or refinancing is good for you to save that extra $$$!
