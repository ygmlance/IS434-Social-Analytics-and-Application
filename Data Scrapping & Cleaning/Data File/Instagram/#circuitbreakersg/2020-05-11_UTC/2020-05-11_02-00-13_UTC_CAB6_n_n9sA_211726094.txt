Literal scrap dress. This one was cobbled together from the pieces left behind after I happily cut out the patterns for various other projects (including a couple other dresses). The skirt was way too short and I really didn't have many options so I literally used scraps and as you can see, I sianned out and didn't bother with all the bottom hems. LOL.
