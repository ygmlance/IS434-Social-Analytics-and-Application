Dear Latteria friends,
Thank you to all of you who keep us busy these days ‚ù§Ô∏è
We were delighted and also a little overwhelmed by the large number of orders we received yesterday, which resulted in some delayed deliveries. Thank you very much for your patience and understanding. üåπ

Today marks the third week of our partnership with Sunlove nursing home üåª So far, we have donated 3,063 food boxes. It fills us with immense gratitude and warmth that we're able to brighten up some people's days during these trying times. Thank you very much for making this possible, Extra Space Singapore! Extra Space Asia Self Storage 
We have also launched another delicious, new sharing menu for Two, and more today! Follow the link to discover what's in store this week. https://www.latteriamb.com/online-ordering
