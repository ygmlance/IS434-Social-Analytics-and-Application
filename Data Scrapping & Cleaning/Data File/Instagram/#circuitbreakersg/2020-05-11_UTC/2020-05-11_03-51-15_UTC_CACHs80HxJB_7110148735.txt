Mondays are the hardest days of the week. But with #circuitbreakersg, I can no longer tell Sundays from Mondays, or Tuesdays from Thursdays. It might be easier to do a #countdown but that will remind me of the days and make it longer. So let’s just leave it as it is, and cherish the days we have at the comfort of our home.

For this rainy Monday morning, I’ve made bittergourd soup with udon noodles. It’s a super simple soup to put together with minimal ingredients. I love it, my kids love it, that’s all that matters. #happyfamily #happybellyhappylife
