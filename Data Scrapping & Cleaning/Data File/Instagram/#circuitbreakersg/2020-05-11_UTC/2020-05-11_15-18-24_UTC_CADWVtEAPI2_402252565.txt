What a late hour to post due to leaving work really late today... But we shall share a little update, especially for pickers who placed order of pre-order / coming back picks. .
.
After a few days of delay, shipment of about 95% “coming back” picks arrived today. We went into crazy packing mode straight after receiving cargo. We have packed about 2/5 of all of those pre-orders after 7 hours of hard work. We will carry on tomorrow to try dispatch as many as we can in time for courier pickup 💪🏻
.
There is about 5% of “coming back” picks were apparently left out at the pot warehouse. Forwarder is transporting them over by Wednesday. We will try our best to dispatch the few orders that are affected by this incident. We will drop those affected a separate text too. .

thank you all for your patience and understanding 🙆🏻‍♀️❤️
