We have launch a new topping - Hantian Jelly (with a crunchy feel, similar to white pearl, but not the shape)
.
This is fairly easy as no cooking will be needed (all you need is to cook the tea) and it can be store longer as compare to black pearls
.
DM us if you are keen in this. 
The bbt diy kit pair with hantian jelly will be going at $26 (inclusive of courier) ðŸ™‚
