Bringing the #taste of #Thailand home today with Goong Ob Woonsen! .

It’s one of my #favourite Thai #dishes to order, but it’s always quite costly outside. By making this at home, I probably only spent quarter of the cost for such a huge portion. These days, I usually make bigger portions so I can give some to loved ones nearby!
