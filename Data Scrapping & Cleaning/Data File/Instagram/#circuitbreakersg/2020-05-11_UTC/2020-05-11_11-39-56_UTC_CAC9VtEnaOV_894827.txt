Black carrot cake. Cai Tou Kueh(菜头粿)
Just the way Bubba likes it.
.
My family of 3 generations have been eating this particular carrot cake from an uncle in Ang Mo Kio. Last year, he finally retired and I cannot find another black carrot cake alike how he made it.
So, mission replicate it is.😛
.
Spinach Tagliatelle in White Bolognese sauce.
.
Simply because Red Bolognese can be quite boring.🤭
