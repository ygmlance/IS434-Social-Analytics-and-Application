[Homecooked] Cir Breaker Day 35 Dinner.
I have been craving curry vegetables for a while, so I cooked my own version with yong tau foo and Korean fishcake to make it a 1-dish-with-rice meal tonight. The vegetables used are cabbage, potatoes, carrots and onions. If I have long beans or okra, I will add these too.

I used the instant curry paste from Mak Nyonya and it's really very good. The Mister gave his thumbs up and said this paste is a keeperðŸ˜„
Thanks to sis @pauline.seefood.diet too for giving me some tips on preparing this dish as she had just cooked it a few days ago. 
I'm also super loving the bowl from @ceramically. So pretty both on the outside and inside
