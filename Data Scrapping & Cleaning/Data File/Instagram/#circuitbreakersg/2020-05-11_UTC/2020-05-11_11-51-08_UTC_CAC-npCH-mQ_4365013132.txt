Posted @withregram • @baitobento Missing this so badly. Bosco Misto, my favourite main course from @originalsinrestaurant! 
These are “spinach, feta and tofu patties coated with almonds and sesame, served with asparagus and a mushroom plum sauce” (quoted from their menu). We tried this on recommendation of the staff and this dish with an eclectic mix of ingredients has been our must-order every time. This is their original creation I think as we’ve not been able to find it elsewhere. .
