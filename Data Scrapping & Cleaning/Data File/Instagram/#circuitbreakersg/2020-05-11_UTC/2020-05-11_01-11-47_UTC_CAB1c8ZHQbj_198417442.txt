💖DIY 3-in-1 Beancurd💖

Inspired by Mr Bean version have been wanting to eat it once again but haven’t buy than @mingjiejiee surprised me with food from Yonghe last week. So I assembled the plain beancurd with the no sugar soymilk and topped with the salted egg peanut tang yuan from @xiyansg last night for breakfast today. 🤗 Beancurd was super smooth and light and soymilk was so fresh. 😍 Expected the tang yuan to be savoury molten lava kind but it turned out to be peanut filling with salted egg paste. The sweet peanut filling flavour was stronger than the faint salted egg. But I like the usual peanut ones so this was not too bad. 💕
