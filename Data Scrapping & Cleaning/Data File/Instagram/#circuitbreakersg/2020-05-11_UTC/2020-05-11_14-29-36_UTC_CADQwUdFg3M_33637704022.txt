If you want to increase your Productivity today.

Sticking to a consistent schedule, be your own supervisor and do what you have to do at that specific time.

Choose a work area in your home that will prevent you from getting distracted, this makes working enjoyable but also productive

Segregate your tasks, cut a difficult job into two or three smaller doable tasks. Choose the most difficult tasks first, and then you can do the easier tasks later.

Schedule small breaks in between your work tasks and make sure you are well-rested each day. Overworking decreases your productivity, and you’ll just wind up being uninspired to 
perform.

Stay motivated by rewarding yourself after a productive day. It’s important that you’re also 
proud of yourself after executing the tasks at hand.
