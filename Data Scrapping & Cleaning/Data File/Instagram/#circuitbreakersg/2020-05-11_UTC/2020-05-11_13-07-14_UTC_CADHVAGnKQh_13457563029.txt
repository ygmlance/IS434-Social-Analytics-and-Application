Ok, I totally didn’t expect this DIY ball run to be so well-loved - the kids (and adults 😂) just couldn’t stop playing with it!
.
I really love that they found their own way to enjoy this board - my girl obviously loves the ball run and my little boy just wants to grab and transfer the pompoms back into the basket.
.
Team work and fun that came totally unprompted. 💕 How lovely!
.
I made this under 30 minutes yesterday, while 👶🏻 napped - you can tell it’s not polished and there are torn marks as I had adjusted the angle of the tracks. Still, my kids loved it and the mileage is amazing!
.
This ball run is worth your time - just grab some cardboard, tp/kitchen towel rolls, scotch tape/glue gun and you’re all set!
