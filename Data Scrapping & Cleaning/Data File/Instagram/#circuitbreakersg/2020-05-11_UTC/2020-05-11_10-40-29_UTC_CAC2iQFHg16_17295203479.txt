Okonomiyaki using @justonecookbook recipe but winging it because I donâ€™t have the Huai Shan or tempura fried bits. Omitted the huai Shan and substituted tempura fried bits with Panko.  I also used her recipe for Okonomiyaki sauce.

It was a winner with the kids. Completely vegan. I used cabbage and carrots. And despite the subpar shredding of cabbage, everyone polished it off.
