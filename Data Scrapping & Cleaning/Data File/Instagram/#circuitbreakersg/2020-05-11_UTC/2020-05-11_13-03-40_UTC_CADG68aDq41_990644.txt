The Mrs says she wanted ‘seafood platter’ after we ask her what other things she wants to eat on Mother’s Day.

No don’t order it, she stressed many many times. For seafood platter we will eat it outside when we can ‘get out to eat’. She said she will whip up the huge prawn with tang hoon she has been dreaming and wanting to eat it herself. That my Mrs!

Her seafood delivery came with loads of things. She steamed the prawns then happily suck the juices from all the prawn heads. So happy she was. Showing you the front and back of the prawn. The Tang Hoon was so tasty too.

Fish is ugly she said coz aiya we are not supposed to take photos of every dish lah. She posted, so I can too. Front and back too. Fish with teriyaki sauce. Simply air fried coz fish is fresh! 
The veg, the market lady sold it to my sis. Said it’s a new veg that they are selling. We haven’t eaten it before, so wife said let’s stir fry with garlic. Ok. Sis said she going to complain to her veg seller. So tough and a little bitter, don’t fit the description during the sale! Hahaha. Next time don’t sell us ‘new veg’, just give her Fan Su Ye! This veg is called Mu Er Cai. “Wood ear veg” coz it looks like black fungus. It has lots of earth and cleaning was a pain thus saith the Wife. Showing you pre and post cooking.
