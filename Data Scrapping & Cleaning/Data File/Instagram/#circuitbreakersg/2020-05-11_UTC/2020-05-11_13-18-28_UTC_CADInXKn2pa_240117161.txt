I am thankful for this #circuitbreakersg
I learnt to ❤️ myself more, get to teach and play with my lil one and watch her growth 🥰, cook for my ❤️ and enjoy all little things we do together. I slow down and do what I wanna do for my family and enjoy every bit of this time now.

@blogilates thank you for creating @piit28official and I have so much fun working out with the program, your YouTube videos, now at #7dayAbchallenge
I totally ❤️ every workout moment because I know I m getting and #feelingstronger 💪🏼💪🏼✌🏼
