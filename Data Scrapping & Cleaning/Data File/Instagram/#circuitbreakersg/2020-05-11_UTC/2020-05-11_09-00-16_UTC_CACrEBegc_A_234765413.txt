120gm coconut sugar

knead dough for 2 minutes until smooth, elastic and ease to work.
Roll your dough out into a log  then ,using a knife of pastry scraper , divide your rolled out log into 4 roughly equal pieces.

Using the palms of both your hands in a rocking motion . roll the dough backwards and forwards , moving out from the center as you work to form 4 long stands of the dough. 
Dust your strands with a little of the tapioca flour and working strand by strand cut into small pieces. 
be mindful of the sizing here the pearls will swell a bit while cooking so smaller is better

Roll the pieces in your hands to form a ball , dip you finger in some water and add a drop to the ball and continue to form. If there is too much tapioca flour on the segments they won‚Äôt roll properly so the drop of water helps to create some surface tension allowing you to form the balls easier.

Remove the pearls with a slotted spoon and drop into some ice water
