Day 34. The cloudy morning almost deterred us from rushing out to get groceries for my aunt, who is living alone. Nevertheless, we went ahead since I hv not seen her for two weeks. After dropping off the groceries and waving to her at her doorstep, I felt more at peace. Lunch - Mr. decided to cook black pepper lamb cubes, mashed potatos with fried bacon bits. A belated mother's day treat. ðŸ˜†. Dinner - Pho with drunken chicken slices. The evening sky is a bonus to the good things happening lately. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #spendingtimewithfamily #realfood #homecookedmeal #instadaily
