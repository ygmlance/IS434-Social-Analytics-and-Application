#hbl hadn't been the easiest but we all got through it. Let's celebrate!! 🎉🎉🎉
.
It wasn't difficult only on us, parents and teachers but also on the kids. They have done well and most, if not all, just can't wait to go back to school. 👍🏻👍🏻
.
Here's a little something for the kids I managed to produce during #circuitbreakersg #stayhome with the children. 😅
.
Made at night after they go to bed as my ME-time to relax, refresh and feel productive. 😆 I know mums can relate 🤣
