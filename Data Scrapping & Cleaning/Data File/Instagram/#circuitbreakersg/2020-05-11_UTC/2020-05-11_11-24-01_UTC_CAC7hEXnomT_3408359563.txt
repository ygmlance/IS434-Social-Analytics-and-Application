Day 35 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (11 May 2020) - #nofilter #easypeasy #quickdinner using another serving of #leftover #frozenfood - I had a couple of badly cut slices of bread that wouldn't make a good sandwich, so I ground them into crumbs; sliced half a cucumber that was starting to shrivel up in the fridge, grated some #parmesan , threw everything together and baked in the oven with some #extravirginoliveoil . Result won't win any prizes for aesthetics but was a #yummy use of #leftovers #stayhomewithascott #homecooking
