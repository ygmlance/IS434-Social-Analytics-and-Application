My family is used to hosting larger parties - we often have 15-20 people at dinners but that's impossible during this #circuitbreakersg. 
So what do we do when we are craving tacos....but can't have a huge #taco party?

This new exercise that we're training up on is huge self-restraint - learning to make half or quarter portions instead.
