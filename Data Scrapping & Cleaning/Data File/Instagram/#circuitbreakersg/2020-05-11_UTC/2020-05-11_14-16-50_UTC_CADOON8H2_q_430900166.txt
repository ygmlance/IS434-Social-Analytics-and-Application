Brand new week! If things go according to plan, itâ€™s 3 more weeks before our circuit breaker gets lifted in Singapore. 3 weeks to plan, learn, negotiate, change, decide .... Thank you for all your kind words of encouragement since our video with @roughcuts.tv aired. We are making progress on our online shop website - slowly but surely - weâ€™re getting our videos & delivering our orders weekly. Weâ€™re super thankful for all the support were receiving & we promise weâ€™d get better & stronger as we grow along! Grow along with us! Happy Monday vibes to all! ðŸ’–ðŸŒˆðŸŒ¹ðŸ˜Š
