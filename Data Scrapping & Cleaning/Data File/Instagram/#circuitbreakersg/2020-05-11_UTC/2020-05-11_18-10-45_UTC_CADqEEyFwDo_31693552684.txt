Tried another online delivery to avoid a trip down to the crowded supermarkets. This time from @greenies.sg.
.
What I really liked are:
1) Packaging (delivered chilled in a Styrofoam box) 
2) Small min quantities (100g to 250g)
3) Reasonable pricing (I even redeemed a 1st timer discount code) 
4) Managing of customer's expectations when they preempted me that the shitake I wanted were oos instead of having me go down the list myself
5) having a wide variety of fruits and vegetables to help attain the min spend
6) A proper Ã¨commerce website
.
What I didn't like: late delivery  timing slots (up till 10pm), only just because I dislike the anticipation of having to wait ðŸ˜…
.
In my previous purchases with other grocers, I have encountered poor delivery packaging including fresh produce being heated in the back of the truck, risking accelerated spoilage, plus broken packaging (of wet items!) from rough handling. Some wholesalers only sold in min quantities of 500g and some don't even inform there were shortage of items delivered, until I emailed in to enquire. Some aren't transparent about pricing, adding in a gst after I sent my orders.
.
Can't wait to try out the vegetables tomorrow. This pandemic has certainly brought about a paradigm shift and I am all for purchasing my fresh produce online.
