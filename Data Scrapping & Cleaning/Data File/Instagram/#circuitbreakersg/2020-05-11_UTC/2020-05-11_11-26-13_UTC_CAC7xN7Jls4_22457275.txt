How’s everyone holding up? We’re less than a month away from the end of circuit breaker! During this stay-home period, we’ve been using our own food containers for take-out and saying no to plastic bags.

In line with sustainability, I want to share that going green does not require any additional cost and you can do it with Geneco’s Get It Green plan, a 100% carbon-neutral electricity plan. It is a 12-months only contract at the lowest rate of 17.45¢ per kWh (wow!), and by hopping on board this sustainable journey with @genecosg, you will even receive a carbon offset certificate.
