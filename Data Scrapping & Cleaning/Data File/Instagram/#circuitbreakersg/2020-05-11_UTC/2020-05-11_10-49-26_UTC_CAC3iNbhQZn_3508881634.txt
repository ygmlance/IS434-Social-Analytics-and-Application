Someone asked me why did I do such a kaleidoscopic durian cake. Was it for Pride? 👨🏻‍🍳🍰⁣
⁣
To which I replied, well, I didn’t think of it when I did the cake design, but since Pride’s round the corner in June, I think it’s great! ⁣
⁣
The real reason why I made this limited edition rainbow version because I see just wanted to cheer people up and make people smile during such times. Period. ♥️⁣
⁣
May we see the rainbow after the storm soon! 🌈🍰🙏🏻⁣
