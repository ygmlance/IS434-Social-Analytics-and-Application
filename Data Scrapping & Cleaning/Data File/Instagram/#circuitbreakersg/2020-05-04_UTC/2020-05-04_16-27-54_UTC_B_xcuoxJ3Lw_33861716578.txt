Teriyaki Beef Burger | 照烧牛肉汉堡 ｜

Major Kitchen Cheat
Burger Bun: Yamazaki Multigrain Bun 
Beef Patty: Don Don DONKI @dondondonkisg Premium Beef Hamburger Teriyaki Sauce Patty
Price: SGD3.90/ pc 
Prep time: 20mins (excluding time for sous-vide)

Buns 
1. Half the buns. Put a slice of cheese on one side and butter on the other side. 
2. Toss them into the oven for 5-10mins under medium heat. You wanna get the cheese melted without burning your buns.

Beef Patties 
1. Sous vide the patties in 68 degrees celcius for 30 mins. 
2. Heat up the oil in a frying pan. Sear the patties just to give it a charred finishing.

Serving 
1. Served with condiments of your choice. We really love our burgers with charred pineapple rings! 
2. We had lettuce, cucumber and fried egg.

Verdict: Don Don DONKI’s beef patties are AMAZING! 4.5 out of 5! 
Taste: They’re extremely flavourful. Well balanced, teriyaki perfection. 
Texture: Very juicy and tender!!
Value: Worth every single penny!
