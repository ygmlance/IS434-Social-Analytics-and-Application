üç∞Always room for desserts and always room for Burnt Cheesecake! The ones at @thekinscafe won my ‚ù§Ô∏è with their creamy and molten interior!‚Å£
‚Å£
Every bite was a delight to eat. Love the Hojicha version even more as the tea taste was pretty strong! If you‚Äôre still craving sweet stuff and cakes, you might wanna check out Kins! They do free delivery with minimum order of $35 üíó On a side note, they also do takeaways and delivery on mains, brunch items! Check out their ig for more details!‚Å£
