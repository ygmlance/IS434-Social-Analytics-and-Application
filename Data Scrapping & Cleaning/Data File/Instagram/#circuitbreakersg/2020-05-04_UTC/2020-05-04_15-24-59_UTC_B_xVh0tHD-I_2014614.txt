𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟐𝟖 - Satisfying my Thai food craving with a plate of #homecooked 𝐏𝐚𝐝 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐢! Okay, I cheated... Other than the ingredients, this was made en-thai-ly with Tesco meal kit that I got from @fairpricesg! I figured it’s so much cheaper to buy the meal kit at $3.95 than to get all the necessary ingredients & condiments. #精打細算⁣

Jazzed up the rice noodles with grilled prawns, lean pork, pan-fried tofu, bean sprouts & egg. Aroi Mak Mak! 🇹🇭🍝😋⁣
