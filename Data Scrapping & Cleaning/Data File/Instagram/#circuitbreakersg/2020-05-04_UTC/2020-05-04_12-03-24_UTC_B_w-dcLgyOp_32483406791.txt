Featuring my new deep dish plateâ€”Crabmeat Pappardelle in Basil Tomato Cream Sauce. Itâ€™s really super simple to make. The only ingredients you have to cut are the cherry tomatoâ€™s and basil.

I got the crabmeat from the frozen section so it comes in those small packs. This was leftovers thoughâ€”so itâ€™s repeated ingredients so that thereâ€™s no wastage, but also a new dish.

The tomato sauce for this dish is slightly different from the lobster dish so you donâ€™t even need any stock as the crab meat is full of flavour.

I decorated the dish with the air-flown flowers from Japan and fresh dill for that extra depth of flavour.

I shall upload this to my website if yâ€™all want to try this simple recipe.

Have a great week ahead everyone! ðŸ§¡
