More used to my food lying on a plate and not standing upright so this was a challenge! ⁣
⁣
Toasted the bread with some butter and mixed herbs! Inside the toast were strips of bacon with creamy scrambled eggs. Didn't have any cheddar cheese slices so I opted to have it without. ⁣
⁣
Mixed some condensed milk with mayo to get that sweet flavour that always comes with korean sandwiches.⁣ Not a perfect recipe but it'll do for now. ⁣

Most difficult part was probably finding something to make the toast stand upright, so I had to make my own stand using cardboard LOL. It was fun tho, kept me occupied for awhile haha.
