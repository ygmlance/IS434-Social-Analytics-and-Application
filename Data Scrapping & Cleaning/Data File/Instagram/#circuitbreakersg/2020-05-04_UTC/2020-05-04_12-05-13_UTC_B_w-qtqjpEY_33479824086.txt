𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐁𝐨𝐝𝐲 𝐁𝐨𝐝𝐲 𝗪𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐨𝐮𝐭 💦⁣

Here's a sweaty & slide-y 🎢 workout for you to get your whole body movinnn' 🕺 All you need for this is a pair of socks to help you slide about 😊⁣
⁣
I really enjoyed doing this workout yesterday because I felt like my whole body was being put to use and the resistance (or lack there of) from the socks on my floor really got my abs engaged and made this workout all the more challenging 🥵 Not to mention, 𝐃𝐑𝐈𝐏𝐏𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐈𝐍 𝐒𝗪𝐄𝐀𝐓 😅⁣
⁣
Having no equipment at home means having to get creative with what you have, and also means working harder during your workouts in order to work your body towards the same level of fatigue it would if you were at the gym 🌈 & and if you're not an avid gym goer like myself, then... this is still a great way to 𝗪𝐄𝐑𝐊 that body for yours 🕺⁣
⁣
𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝗪𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐨𝐮𝐭 consists of 𝟓 𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐬 all of which are variations that work the whole body (meaning they are harder and more challenging!!). You are going to complete 𝟏𝟎-𝟏𝟐 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐞 & going to complete 𝟕 𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐬 of this 🥳 with a 𝟏 𝐦𝐢𝐧 𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤 in-between rounds and no longer!⁣
⁣
You're going to end the round with an absolute killer  which is the: 𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐞𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐦𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬🔥🔥🔥 - For every Burpee, you're going to increase the number of mountain climbers. ⁣
