CB Day 28:

I'm so glad we had this mini trip before the whole lockdown.
.
.
I'm pretty sick of all the coronavirus video, just as much as I'm sure you're quite sick of my guitar videos for the past one month ðŸ˜‚
.
.
Took a break from weekly video making to reflect about what I've done so far, and clearly embarrassed so I've hidden almost all my stupid 6tysecondsunday video.
.
.
28 more days of circuit breaker - I know some of you may have been out for groceries or a jog but I've been inside the house since day one. Almost don't remember how outside world looks like anymore.
.
.
Stay safe & stay sane everyone. Oh, and May the 4th be with you.
