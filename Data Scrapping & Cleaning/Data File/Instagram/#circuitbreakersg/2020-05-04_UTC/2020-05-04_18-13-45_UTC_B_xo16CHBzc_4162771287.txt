Day 28 of circuit breaker (4/5/2020).
.
Starting an initiative to Zoom online with individual friends whereby I not only get to fellowship, catch up and bond with but also get to practise my guitar, praise, worship, pray for or pray with them as well! 
Let us encourage and uplift one another in Hope and Joy especially during this period of circuit breaker! 🎸🎼✝️🙏🗣🙌✌💖💪😊
.
Had 3 awesome sessions of Zoom throughout today! PM me if you wish to join me for a session of worship and prayer request, I would love to pray with and for you! .

The generous man [is a source of blessing and] shall be prosperous and enriched, And he who waters will himself be watered [reaping the generosity he has sown]. ~ Proverbs 11:25 AMP .

Disclaimer:  Permission granted to post the pictures by friends as they wish to bless you too! 💖👍🙏
