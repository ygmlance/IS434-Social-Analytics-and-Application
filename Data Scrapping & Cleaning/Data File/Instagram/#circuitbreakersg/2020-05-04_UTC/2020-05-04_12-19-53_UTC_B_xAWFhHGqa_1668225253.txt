Here is our Car Care Tip to help keep your vehicle in running condition during this Circuit Breaker period!

#2 Keep your Vehicle Battery Charged by Starting the Car for 15 mins at least once a week

As the vehicle battery will discharge overtime, remember to start your vehicle and keep the engine idling for at least 15mins to ensure the normal functioning of the battery. Also, disconnect your 24-hour in-car recorder to prevent draining out the battery.

However, please note that as a safety and preventive measure, remember to wear a face mask when you head out to check your vehicle. Wash your hands with soap and sanitize them once you are back at home.
