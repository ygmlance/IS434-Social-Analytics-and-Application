Virtual Forest Bathing across the lands of Asia - first of its kind event for your self-care and for charity!⁠
⁠
I am so proud and excited as part of this collective of certified nature and forest therapy guides in Asia to offer this experience of celebrating Mothers' Day with Mother Earth! A gift of delightful sensory connections, to see the beauty outside again, to feel the beauty inside again. Resting in the beauty across lands and people! 🌺⁠
⁠
All proceeds will be donated to The Jane Goodall Institute.⁠

Spaces are limited. You are most welcome to join with your mother (but you don't have to), and you can join this 'virtual tour' of Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan from anywhere!⁠

💟10 May, Sunday⁠
💟Time: 3 pm - 4.30 pm (GMT+8)⁠
