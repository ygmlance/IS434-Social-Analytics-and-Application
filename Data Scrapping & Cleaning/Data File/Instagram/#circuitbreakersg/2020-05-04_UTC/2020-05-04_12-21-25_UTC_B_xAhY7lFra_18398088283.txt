👩‍🍳MUNCH AT HOME👩‍🍳
Our first attempt at making these pancakes and we think it’s pretty decent?🤔There’s definitely a lot more room for improvement and after taking some quick shots the pancakes have deflated quite a bit😢Really respect restaurants/ cafes who create souffle pancakes regularly with that perfect wobble and height💪🏻 Nonetheless, the taste is still there - fluffy, eggy and makes a really good tea time snack yums🥰Substituted the whipped cream with yogurt and loaded it with lots of fruits (whatever we could find in our fridge) and there we have it - some delicious pancakes!!
