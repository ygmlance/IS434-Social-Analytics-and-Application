+4.5.2020 | Mon | CB Day 28

Almost lost count of which day we are in CB ðŸ¥´ so many throwback pix which i want to serve as a record. Hope I can quickly post them all up. CB yet so busy, when can slow down and do nothing? ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ Repurposing food again. Made San Lo Hor Fun the other day and had some leftovers. Today I made a quick Wat Tan Hor Fun gravy with lots of veg n king oyster mushroom to go with it. Quick lunch for me & hb while Kimi Ng had a ham & cheese wrap.
