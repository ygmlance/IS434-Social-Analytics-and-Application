Made it for the last few hours of @shopbackgo #gocookoff challenge🐓💪✨ adapted the recipe from @shopbacksg using existing ingredients in the fridge✨ #sustainablecooking 🌿⚠️SWIPE FOR RECIPE⚠️💕
I love how the key ingredients can be replaced with other ingredients✨ and you can still get a flavorful plate of chicken rice 🐔do share below if you have other ideas on how to zing up your chicken rice 🐔 🍚✨😂 you still have a few hours left to join the fun by @shopbacksg ✨
