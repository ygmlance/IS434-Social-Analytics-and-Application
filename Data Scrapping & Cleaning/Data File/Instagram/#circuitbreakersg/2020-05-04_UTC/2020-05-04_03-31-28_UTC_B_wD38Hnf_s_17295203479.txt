Pumpkin tortilla soup adapted from @loveandlemons.  So satisfying and delicious!

I hate chopping up pumpkins because they can be difficult. My tricks are:
1. Sharpen the chopper. I just sharpened my chopper last week and it was a huge game changer.
2. Chop into half, take out the seeds and then rub some extra virgin olive oil and roast at 200C for half an hour.  The skin easily peels off and the flesh is easy to cut up.
