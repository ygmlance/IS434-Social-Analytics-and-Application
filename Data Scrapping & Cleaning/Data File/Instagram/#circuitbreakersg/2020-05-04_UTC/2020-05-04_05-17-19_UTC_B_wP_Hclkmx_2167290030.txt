DAY 28 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
PIDE

When everything else in life takes a backseat, and the future is full of uncertainity, we turn to the little things in our everyday life, to give us that daily dose of excitement. And one of those things in our everyday life is variety in food!!
Everytime my sons ask ... Ma, whats for lunch? Ma, what are you cooking? ... I want the answer to be something that will make them smile. 
Something new, something different 😊
This was dinner last night.

We have Pide quite often at restaurants in Arab Street and at Satay by the Bay, but this was my first try to make it at home. Have been wanting to try it out since my visit to Turkey last year. Finally did. My babies loved it, and found it perfect, but I  would give myself a 5/10 for the bread, and a 9/10 for the filling and 5/10 for the look 😎
I used mince beef filling and egg & cheese filling. The bread was not my recipe, just saw one on the net. Not fair to mention who, because I dont know if the recipe is not good, or it was me who didnt do a good job. Realization - its basically pizza base recipe. May have some variations like most recipes do, so the next time I make pide, I will use my moms pizza base recipe. Will share that with u all soon. 
Till then peeps, keep cooking! Keep safe 🤞🏻
