🏠 Handover & Takeover of HDB 4-RM Rental Unit in Pasir Ris ⠀
⠀
I had a Zoom appointment with my clients a few days ago. I was facilitating the handing and taking over process of their rental unit to the new tenants.⠀
⠀
Naturally, there would be some limitations when it comes to online communications. It would be difficult to see if the unit is properly cleaned or if there is anything that needs fixing before the new tenant takes over. And it's such a pretty strange experience for me because I'm used to be the one doing the inspection. But now I have to rely on the tenants to inspect everything for me.⠀
⠀
However, I am extremely thankful to my clients for being very patient and detailed with the process 👍🏼⠀
⠀
Alhamdulillah, I have a good working relationship with the landlord’s agent as my current tenants have been staying there for 2 years and the new tenant, who is also one of my current tenants, is taking over the unit for another year ☺️⠀
⠀
Thank to you all parties involved! Thank you for facilitating and accommodating to making the process a smooth one 🥰⠀
