Brunch today, was a Southern Indian Fish Curry Fried Rice! Yes! You read it right, Curry Fried Rice! Onions and minced garlic were sweat in the wok, beaten eggs were added, and just as they were about to be cooked, refrigerated leftover rice was added, along with a swirl of fish sauce. The mixture was stirred well, and chopped fishcakes, bean sprouts and chopped Chye Sim, or Mustard Greens were added, and the mixture stirred/tossed well. Leftover Fish Curry gravy from Fridayâ€™s prata breakfast was added in small batches, and mixed/tossed well, using high heat. Served hot, with a topping of fried shallots and fried whitebait! Fragrant and tasty! ðŸ˜‹ #fishcurryfriedrice #friedrice #friedriceparadise #stayathome #eatathome #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #nowastemeal #usingleftovers #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
