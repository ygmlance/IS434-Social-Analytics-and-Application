Day 28 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg - 4 May 2020 - #nofilter #lunch of #homemade #guotie #锅贴 #dumplings - Not happy with my first attempt despite spending so many hours making everything from scratch. Dough was slightly too thick, filling portions were too small and I think I fried a tad too long, and with too much oil. Lessons learnt. #stayhomewithascott #stayhomestaysafe everyone! #homecooking
