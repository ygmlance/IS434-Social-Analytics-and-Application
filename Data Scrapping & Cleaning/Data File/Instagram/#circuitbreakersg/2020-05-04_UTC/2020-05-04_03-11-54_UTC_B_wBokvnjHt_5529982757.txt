Did some pan frying of #salmon fillets until nicely browned but the meat is still tender and juicy. I threw in some cherry tomatoes, scallions and leek and finished it off with a sweet-savory glazed Teriyaki Sauce with honey. Itâ€™s easy and absolutely no fuss on this Monday #lunch Day 28 of #circuitbreakersg
