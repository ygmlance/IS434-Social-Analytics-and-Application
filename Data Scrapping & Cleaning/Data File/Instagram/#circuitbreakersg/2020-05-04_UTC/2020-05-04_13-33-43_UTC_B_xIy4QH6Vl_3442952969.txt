When the CB period started, we stocked up on a few canned beans thinking theyâ€™d last forever. ðŸŒ± Lately, they seem to be making an appearance on instagram, so we were inspired to put them to use. ðŸŒ± This dish is the epitome of comfort food, admittedly a bit more suited to winter, but comfort food none the less. ðŸŒ± We sautÃ©ed garlic and onions in olive oil then added cannelloni beans, shitake mushrooms, baby zucchini (from our Nouri veggie box) and dried boletus mushrooms from Latvia. ðŸŒ±The homemade artichoke broth was reinforced with some finely chopped kombu. ðŸŒ± Once in the bowls, we drizzled some homemade herb oil on top to add depth of flavor. ðŸŒ± Thank you @ruta_madaraja and @ivoveiss for the tasty mushrooms. ðŸŒ±
