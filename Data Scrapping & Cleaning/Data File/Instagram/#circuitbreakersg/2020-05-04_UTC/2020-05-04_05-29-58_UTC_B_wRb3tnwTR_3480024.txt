Cir Breaker Day 28 Lunch for the Mister. 
We bought the Freezepak chicken nuggets yesterday, and of course after seeing @leslie.koh's post, we had to try them out.
And OMG, these are so legit, so crispy outside and tender inside after air frying. 
Chomped down with our stash of McDonald's curry sauce, these babies really did taste 95% like the real deal. Plus the double cheeseburger that has been in deep freeze, reheated and still tasted 99% as good, the Mister is having a food coma now.
