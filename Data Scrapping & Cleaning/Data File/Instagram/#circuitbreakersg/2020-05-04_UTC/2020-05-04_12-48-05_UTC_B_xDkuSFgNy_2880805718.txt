Mornington Peninsula Brewery Pale Ale 🇦🇺🍺
⁣
I really like this one. Pours a pale gold with a lovely dense head, with nose and notes of citrus and a clean, refreshing finish. The use of wheat malt contributes to a light, smooth palate and imparts a gentle touch of acidity that makes this a highly-sessionable brew. ⁣

Glad I finally got to try a @mpbrewery beer, courtesy of @templecellars. I will definitely keep an eye out for their other creations!
