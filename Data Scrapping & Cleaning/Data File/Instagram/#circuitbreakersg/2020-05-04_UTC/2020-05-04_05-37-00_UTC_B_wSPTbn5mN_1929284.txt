CB 28 of 56 ( halfway mark). Todayâ€™s homecooked lunch was Japanese Curry with rice. Didnâ€™t look nice here because I ran out of ðŸ¥• carrots.  Kept the extra curry sauce to cook curry pasta soon ( ha, just have to find some ways as pasta sauces are Out of Stock in the marts). #CBday28 #circuitbreakersg #homecookedlunch #stayhome #stayhomeandcook #japanesecurry #workfromhomemeal
