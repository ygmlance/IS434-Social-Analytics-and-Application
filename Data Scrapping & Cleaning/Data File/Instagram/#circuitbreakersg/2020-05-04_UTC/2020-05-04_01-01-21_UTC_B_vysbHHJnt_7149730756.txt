As we stay home during the circuit breaker period, we can still go green and do good for our planet this #PowerGoodMondays.

Earlier last month, our #ChangeMakersSG @greennudgesg had to postpone their Collection Drive - an initiative to help Singaporeans go #ZeroWaste with their household items.

However, this setback hasn't stopped them from doing their part to encourage Singaporeans to take on green practices with their set of Green Tips to try out!

Let’s do our part to foster a greener Singapore amid these challenging times. Drop a visit to Green Nudge’s Instagram to find out more about their Green Tips!
