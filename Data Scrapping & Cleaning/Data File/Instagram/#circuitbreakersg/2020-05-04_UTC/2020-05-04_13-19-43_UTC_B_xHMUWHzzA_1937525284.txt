Sally Lunn bread fresh from the oven! Trying to recreate the bread I ate at Sally Lunn’s Historic Eating House in Bath 🍞 can’t wait to slice into it as it smells so nice😋 #sallylunnloaf #sallylunnbread #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakerbaking #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomeforsg #bread #breadbaking #carbsarelife
