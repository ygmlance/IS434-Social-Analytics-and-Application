We hope everyone had a good rest over the long weekend!

Have you heard the good news? Our government will be slowly opening up the #circuitbreakersg restrictions from 12 May onwards! We hope that you’re as stoked as we are for life to be back to normal soon 🙌🏻 Here’s a #covid19 survival guide put together by our team to remind you of the proper measures to take and masks to use when you’re out and about; we have been seeing a lot of masks dumping at very low pricings from sellers who are trying to clear their masks from non-registered manufacturers so we urge you to beware and buy wisely!

Let’s continue keeping the community spread numbers low and the virus at bay 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
