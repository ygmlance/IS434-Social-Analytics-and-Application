04 May 2020. It was supposed to be the end of the #circuitbreakersg (from 7 April to 4 May) before the extension was announced on 21 April.

We have been staying home for 4 weeks now. It hasn’t gotten easier trying to cope with #wfh, preparing meals, breaking up fights and being an IT support. It’s hard trying to have a decent work conversation while sharing a study room with 2 other kids having their #hbl at the same time. I received an email from Zahn’s Kindy this afternoon about having a weekly zoom meeting (not compulsory) and I deleted it right away.

While I am thankful for having more time with them, it’s all so challenging when the younger ones need my attention. I remember during the first week when I broke down, after yelling at them to stop fighting, while having a discussion with my colleagues. Never have I ever cried in my entire career (except when my CEO passed away)! Today is equally hard. I gave Zahn 2 strokes after repeatedly telling him not to misbehave.

I know we are in this together and I know I am not alone. If you could, please share how you cope! #momguilt
