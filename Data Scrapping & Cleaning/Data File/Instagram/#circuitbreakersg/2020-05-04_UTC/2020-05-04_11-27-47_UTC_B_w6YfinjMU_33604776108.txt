Taiwanese braised pork rice (滷肉飯) and Japanese-style marinated eggs (味付け玉子). First and last time Yi-2 made this dish was in 2017 because it's really quite a labour of love, requiring constant stewing for about 3 hours.

Yi-2 sounds like a robot doesn't it? The three of us have names with "Yi" in them, hence the name "Yiiitadakimasu"! .
