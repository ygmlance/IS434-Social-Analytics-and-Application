Traditional old school buns - coconut and Japanese red bean! 🥥
✨
The coconut filling was filled with an intense gula melaka aroma, while the red bean filling didn’t taste too artificial, but they were very very sweet. I didn’t like the bread though, as it was too chewy till the extent of being rubbery and the yeast smell was way too strong. Is it I don’t know how to eat traditional buns alr? 😂
