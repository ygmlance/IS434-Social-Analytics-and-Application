Western cuisine is the theme for tonight's dinner ~ bbq pork ribs, boiled brocolli, french fries & mushroom sauce. I also did a remake of @jae.explorer 's favourite western food from the hawker centre ~ salmon with fries! Thinking that he would be so happy with his food, he totally REJECTED it!😭😭WHY? coz he says he wants to have a fancy dinner and not the dinner on the kiddo plate!?? So, his "definition" of a fancy dinner is that the food should be served in any plate except the kiddo one! 😂😂😂 I also kneaded a batch of cutie mantou today at the request of the lil one! Guess which did he ask for? 妈妈有求必应哦！(words of the hubby😉😉) #igsg #igfoodies #sgmummies #sgkid #homecooking #sghomecooks #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakermeals #stayhomesg #stayhomeday28 #westernfood #mantou #playingwithdough
