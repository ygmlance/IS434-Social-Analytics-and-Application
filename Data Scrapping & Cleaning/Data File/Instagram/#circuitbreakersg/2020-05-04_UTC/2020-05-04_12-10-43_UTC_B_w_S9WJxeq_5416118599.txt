Terra SG has partnered with CP-Meiji to bring our hands-on sustainability education programme for students undergoing home-based learning (HBL) during this “Circuit Breaker” period, as an important reminder to stay sustainable while staying at home.

With more household waste being generated during this period, our video tutorials will teach students how they can upcycle disused CP-Meiji products into items that they can use at home, such as the carton pouch and the mask holder.

View our in-depth step-by-step upcycling video tutorials here:

- Meiji Plastic Carton Pouch: bit.ly/meiji-upcycledplasticpouch

We hope that these videos will not only educate but also inspire our young minds to rethink the possibilities of our waste.
