🌧️CB Day28 - Lunch Time 🌧️
.
Still weather is so gloomy...is it have Monday Blues???
.
Having Marrow with Tang Hoon and Canned Sardines...pairing it with my leftover oatmeal.
.
When I was a kid, I never like oatmeal. Only elderly likes oatmeal, that's why it's called 老人麥片(layman terms for Quaker Oats). As age catches up, I started to appreciate oatmeal, I think it's so yummy 🤤 and easy to digest! .
Oops! 🙊🙉🙈 sign of aging!
