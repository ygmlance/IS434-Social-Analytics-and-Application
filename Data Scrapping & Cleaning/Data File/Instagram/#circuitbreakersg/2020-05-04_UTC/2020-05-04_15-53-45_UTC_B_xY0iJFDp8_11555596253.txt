The original #circuitbreakersg was supposed to end today.
.
Iâ€™m just thankful we can operate our CHI outlet after closing it for 2 weeks. It was a tiring process to call MTI and Enterprise SG to receive standard generic replies and I felt snubbed by our landlord that Iâ€™m not trying hard enough to get the approval which other tenants did ðŸ˜’
.
Iâ€™m not alone in this as many other businesses are stuck in limbo.
.
Iâ€™m not alone in this and I can feel the support of my Foreword team who are very cooperative and seeking to contribute tirelessly to whatever work we need to do.
.
Thankyou.
