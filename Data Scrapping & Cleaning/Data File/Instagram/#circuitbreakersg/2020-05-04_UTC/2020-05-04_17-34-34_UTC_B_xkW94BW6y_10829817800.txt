May the fourth be with you ! 🤩 Finally May is here and we’re halfway through the CB ! Here’s my recommendation for CB wine which is good value and easy to drink ! 2015 Meurgey-Croses - Macon Uchizy. (WS88) Full of stone fruit, peach aromas with a hint of citrus peel. Balanced acidity and mineral toward the finish. Pleasant food wine and especially lovely to match with the truffle flavored mushroom pizza and Holy Cow rice roll (Tajima striploin, shrimp tempura, kimchi peach emulsion) from @akirabacksg !  Their signature Tuna pizza is temporarily unavailable so I had this mushroom pizza. It never disappoint and full of truffle aroma was bringing my appetite back !!! Just need to call them an hour in advance and food will be ready to take out (or free delivery over $60 too) Super duper good choice for my Chardonnay and the food was still fresh (and in good shape ) when I open those at home !!! Plus you can enjoy 20% discount with promo code for both Madame Fan and Akira Back so don’t miss it out ! The wine is available @chopesg and  https://shop.grandcruwines.com or DM me for the special case offer !!! Chloe’s Score 3.8/5  #wine #winelover #winestagram #wineofinstagram #wineoftheday #sgwine #sgwines #sgwinelover #sgfood #sgfoodporn #sgfoodlover #foodstagram #foodiesg #savefnbsg #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #chope #gcwinessg #akiraback #akirabacksg #와인 #와인안주 #와인스타그램 #싱가폴 #싱가폴맛집 #싱가폴라이프 #락다운 #28일차 #배달음식 #배달맛집
