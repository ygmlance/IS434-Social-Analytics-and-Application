The COVID-19 circuit breaker in Singapore has had a big impact on society and the economy. As a vulnerable group, the LGBTQ community is likely to be affected negatively by the societal stresses. As such, the Heartweavers are holding a dialogue for members of the community to share their experiences and support each other. 
We are honoured to have community leaders from more than 10 LGBTQ groups attending our online dialogue, Breaking The Circuit, Breaking Your Silence. Together, they represent a diverse spectrum of the LGBTQ community. We hope individual participants can benefit from the safe space and support that these community groups offer during these difficult times. 
Participants in the dialogue will be anonymous. It will be held on 9 May 2020, 3pm to 5pm, via a Zoom conference. [Update: Registrations for the dialogue have closed.] .
