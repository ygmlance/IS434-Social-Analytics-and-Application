It's hotpot time!

With the "circuit breaker" ongoing in Singapore, my children have not left home since their last school day on 8 April 2020.

The children continued school with home-based learning, while I continued to work from home, spending much more time preparing for my students' home-based learning.

Hubby, on the other hand, has more free time working from home. He decided to put in more efforts in planning for meals and cooking.

As we're all at home, we're spending more time together as a family now and enjoy our quality meal time together. This was our dinner on May Day, planned and provided by hubby.

The children worked together to prepare the ingredients and we enjoyed cooking and chatting over the hotpot. It's a fun way to bond over food!

How's the situation like at where you live?
