🍲Day 28/56•StayHome Dinner 
Let's eat Army Stew tonight! I've been craving kimchi soup since last last last week (ya, really long ago!) and no luck at replenishing kimchi supply from the few supermarkets near home 😩 finally hubby bought a tub fr a Korean mart when he was running errands 😆 really a tub! Now I can eat kimchi everyday!

This portion's for 2A1C, Mini K obviously couldn't eat this...I made steamed egg & grilled chicken leg for him 😋 .
