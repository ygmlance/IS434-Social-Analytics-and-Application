Decided to #eathealthy this #circuitbreakersg #Monday and ordered myself a #hakka #lunch of #thundertearice from @thundertearice.sg (thank you for the note). I opted for brown rice and enjoyed it with all the toppings offered: peanuts, driedshrimp, chyepoh (or preserved radish) & fried ikan bilis along with chopped #vegetables and tofu. I just love mixing the rice and ingredients with the #basil ‘tea’ ! The thunder tea rice was #satisfying and #yummy ! #eatclean #loveyourlocal #savefnbsg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #latergram
