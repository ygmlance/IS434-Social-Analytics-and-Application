Day 28 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (4 May 2020) #nofilter #quickdinner - #udon with #porkstew that I made 1 month ago and froze; saw the beef stew my buddy @koolrebecca made and had a craving for stew, so I used up my last bag of my #guinness  #porkstew from my #frozenfood stash, #yummy and #easypeasy ; earlier, I also pan-fried the rest of the #guotie #锅贴 #dumplings not in the fridge, with less oil, to ascertain what went wrong with the batch for lunch; turned out slightly better but ultimately I think it was the flour that was the problem - lesson learnt. #stayhomewithascott #homecooking
