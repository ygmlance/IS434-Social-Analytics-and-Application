Posted @withregram • @levelsingapore Don’t have dumbbells or kettlebells but still want to retain muscle mass and work on good movement?⁣
⁣
Our Virtual Strength— Bodyweight Conditioning class works with you to use odd objects around your house to build muscle, improve lifting technique and increase muscular endurance in a way that’s different from High Intensity Interval Training.⁣
⁣
We’re moving away from the searing heat of HIIT training to focus on the good ol’ low and slow. They say you get more flavour that way, and we’ll show you how.⁣
⁣
This class runs for 60 minutes, and is led by Verónica Hernández (@levelupwithveronica)⁣
