If youâ€™re running a restaurant, hawker stall, cafe or any sort of F&B outlet - tag @meatlessmondaysg in your posts and stories and we would love to help share your promotions and delivery menus with our followers. 
Donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re not a vegetarian outlet - the only condition is that you offer a minimum of three meatless main courses.

Feel free to tag your favourite F&B outlet. Let's get through this together ðŸ’ª
