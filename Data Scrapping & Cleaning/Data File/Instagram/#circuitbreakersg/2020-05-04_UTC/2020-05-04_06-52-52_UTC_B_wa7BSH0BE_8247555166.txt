Hawker food for our weekend stay home dinner, all from East Coast Lagoon Food Village! 🏖
✨
Tried the food from almost all of the popular stalls there apparently, and over ordered as usual 🙊. My favourite is the fried carrot cake! The carrot cake was of the right texture and perfectly fried without being overly greasy. One of the best fried carrot cakes locally for me. Do you prefer white or black carrot cake? I prefer the white! 🥕
