Hooray!! It's the last day of home-based learning for now. No more rushing like crazy to ensure the kids do and hand up their homework properly every weekday. It was still a mad rush today to get everything done before lunch and juggling between getting groceries online (you know how fast delivery slots get snapped up ðŸ˜…), helping the kids out with online submissions, ensuring the toddler doesn't get into trouble and more.

So it was @thesoupspoonsg to the rescue! I had stocked up on their soup packs in case of emergencies on days like this when there's just too much to be done. So I heated up the SG chicken and mushroom ragout soup pack and added some bear pasta to it because the kids really love pasta! A healthy and delicious lunch was settled for the three just in time. Phew. ðŸ˜„ Happy kids with happy tummies makes a happy mummy!
