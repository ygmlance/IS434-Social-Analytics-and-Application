Besides working out, home baking, cooking, taking care of kids, doing household chores and working from home, you can release all the negative energy during this circuit breaker by doing daily meditation.

Take a moment to slow down and tune in to hear what your soul, body and mind need.

I have started my daily meditation since 2 months ago by using the app @calm .

Calm is the #1 app for Sleep, Meditation and Relaxation. Join the millions experiencing better sleep, lower stress, and less anxiety with our guided meditations, Sleep Stories, breathing programs, stretching exercises, and relaxing music. Calm is recommended by top psychologists, therapists, and mental health experts.

There are 5 benefits of dailyüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è meditation according to science.

1 ÔºâMeditation can strengthen the body, restore the body's sub-healthy state, and enhance the functions of the internal organs.Especially for chronic diseases and stubborn symptoms.

2 )When you sit still, your mind is focused on one thing, the breathing becomes smooth and even, the total amount of air entering the lungs through breathing is relatively stable, and the amount of oxygen entering the heart is also relatively stable, which facilitates the regulation of blood pressure.

3 )Meditation can improve the temperament of life and shape a healthy and beautiful posture.

4 )Meditation can relieve stress, release anxiety, tension, irritability, and restlessness, and make the whole life feel calm, joyful, comfortable, and at ease.

5 )Meditation can open up inner wisdom, guide people to reflect on themselves, be aware of the existence of life, and achieve liberation.

6 )Long-term meditation will make the mind clear and sharp.

Make meditation your daily practice, and it will soon turn into a habit. 
Let‚Äôs take a deep breath together! .
