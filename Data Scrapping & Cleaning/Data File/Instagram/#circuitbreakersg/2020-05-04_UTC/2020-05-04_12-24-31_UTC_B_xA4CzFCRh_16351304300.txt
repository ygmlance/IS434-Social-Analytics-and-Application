Located in a corner of Potong Pasir, Penguin’s Kitchen brings authentic Thai food to the table. We spoke to Peng, chef & owner of the shop. 
When asked how he became a chef, Peng shared a funny story of how his first attempt at cooking while studying in Bangkok caused his friends to get food poisoning. Inspired by that experience, he decided to drop out of university and go to culinary school instead. After culinary school, Peng  went back to university and started work as a food scientist. It never occured to him to start his own restaurant then. 
In 2012, after marrying his Singaporean wife, Peng moved to Singapore. Together, they decided to open a small stall named ‘Thai Jing Jing’ in Jalan Besar. After moving the stall to Hougang, they decided to close the stall due to the lack on manpower. 
In 2019, after gaining more experience, Penguin’s Kitchen was born. When asked why the name Penguin’s Kitchen, Peng answered that it was actually a play on the phrase ‘Peng in Kitchen’. Like all other businesses in the F&B industry, Penguin’s Kitchen has definitely not been spared the ripple effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Circuit Breaker. Ever since restaurants were forced to convert to the delivery or takeout model, business has dropped by 75%. As a parting message to our followers, Peng would like all of you to know that Penguin’s Kitchen is still committed to providing quality Thai food for everyone.
