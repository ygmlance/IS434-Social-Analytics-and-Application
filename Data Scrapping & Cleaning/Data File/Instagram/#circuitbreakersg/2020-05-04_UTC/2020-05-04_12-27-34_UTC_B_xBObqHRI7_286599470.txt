Believe it or not, but my brother-in-law Luigi gave me the instructions on how to cook risotto. I was a very good listener. 🤣From his recipe of adding red wine over 15 years ago, to my own versions with champagne and vodka. This evening it’s my turn to cook. It’s risotto with Belvedere Intense vodka,  lemon pepper and broccoli, topped with sautéed garlic chicken and a fish pie for dinner. What better way to top it all off with an Amarone but first; a melange of craft beers from a fellow Italian? Grazie @claudioberry81 for sorting out the beers!! 🙏😊 Risotto. Is it because I’m Chinese??😂
