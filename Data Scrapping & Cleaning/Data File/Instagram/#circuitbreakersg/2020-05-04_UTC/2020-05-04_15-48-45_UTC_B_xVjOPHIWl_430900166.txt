I have really been feeling this the past few weeks. This pandemic has almost forced businesses worldwide to a standstill,  while our healthcare personnel battle round the clock to contain the covid19 virus and save lives! The tears, heartache, the fear of the future and the anxiety is real. So when the Circuit Breaker lifts eventually... we have to face up to new realities. Social distancing will be the new normal. Staggered shifts? WFH? More masks? More hand sanitizers? More protection? More safety measures? More negotiations? Nobody has all the answers, coz nobody has been down this road before. Weâ€™re all newbies here & weâ€™re all in this together. Maybe itâ€™s an opportunity to rethink, reset, re-direct our efforts and try new ways of doing things. Old ways wonâ€™t open new doors. And since weâ€™re forced to enter this new phase together, why not make a splash while weâ€™re at it?! ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦
