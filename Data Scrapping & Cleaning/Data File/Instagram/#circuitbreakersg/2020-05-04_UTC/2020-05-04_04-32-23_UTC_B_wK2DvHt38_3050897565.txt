Yesterday was Farmland day. With McDonald's Singapore closed we wanted burgers, but are not the sort to make patties from scratch. So #beef #patties and #fries were Farmland, buns from @friendsofgardenia, cheese from @emborgasia. Caramelised #onions and #mayonnaise are a must for me. Plus my favourite seaweed chicken.
You know what? McDonald's or even BK probably cheaper! 
Also I always thought #Farmland was some super American brand but totally impressed its apparently local?! Just realised when I googled.
