Dinner this evening was steamed rice, with a dish of stir-fried Nai Bai, and a Chinese-style Prawn Sambal. The sambal was put together by sweating minced garlic, cubed onions, sliced ginger and red chillies, till fragrant. Dried shrimp sambal chilli paste and a spoon of sugar was added with a little bit of water to dilute, then medium-sized prawns were thrown in. Tomato wedges, and spring onions were added, along with a squeeze of calamansi lime to finish off. Super tasty! ðŸ˜‹ #stirfriednaibai #prawnsambal #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #stayathome #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
