COVID-19: Safe work measures post-Circuit Breaker
Progressively open the economy; with proper safe distancing (SD) measures 👩‍💻 Even prior to circuit breaker, work activities on site reduced by 70%, with many telecommuting ➡ This should continue post circuit breaker - some sectors will open up earlier than others. Govt will work with companies on SD measures ✅ *Companies should implement:*
- SD measures
- Safe rest areas - Technology to track and trace
- Testing of higher risk groups - Better cleanliness and hygiene standards, esp high touch areas ✅ *Have business continuity measures*
- Workers in different shifts and work sites; don’t mix and interact outside work
