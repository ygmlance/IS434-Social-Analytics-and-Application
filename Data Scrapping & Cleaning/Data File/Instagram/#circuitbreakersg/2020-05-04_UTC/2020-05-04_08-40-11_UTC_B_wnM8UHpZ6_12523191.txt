this was Zachary this morning, with poop in his diapers, struggling. for whatever reasons, he didn’t want to be changed. he cried while we roughhoused him throughout the entire change screaming murder. sorry, son, mama could’ve done it better.

he’s speaking pretty well for his age and that may be why everyone expects even more for him. we forget he knows limited words, we forget he can get overwhelmed with big emotions too and that he may not know how to express them, we forget he’s not even 2. we forget to be patient.

this little being must have felt even more upset because mama didn’t understand :( surely my experience resonates with other parents, and his with other kids. i hope you remember to take deep breaths the next time it happens, i hope you choose to comfort your little one, i hope you will remain calm. i hope you understand our kids need to learn self-regulation and they can only learn it through you. you are their best role model.

When little people are overwhelmed by big emotions, it’s our job to share our calm. Not join their chaos.
