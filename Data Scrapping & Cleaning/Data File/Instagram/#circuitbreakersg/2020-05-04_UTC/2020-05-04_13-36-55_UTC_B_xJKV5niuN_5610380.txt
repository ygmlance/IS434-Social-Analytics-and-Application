We were supposed to end the circuit breaker measures period today but it is extended for one more month. For the past 4 weeks, there were ups and downs. It was tough to juggle work and family at the same time. I was lucky to have a supportive and hands on hubby who does a fair share of the housework. My five year old is also doing her part by tidying up her room every morning and helps me with the laundry too. We also celebrated the 2nd birthday for the baby in the family, which was a simple but lovely affair. One more month to go - creating memories while trying to maintain our sanity at the same time.  #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #stayhomewithchildren #familytime #memories #covid19 #sgkids #kidsactivities #kidsactivitiesathome
