Something #colourfulandcheery from my last trip to #kyoto to brighten your Monday, especially those of us who happened to still have the #Mondayblues . Over here in #Singapore , our original #circuitbreakersg was supposed to end tomorrow, but it has been extended till 2nd June. Students will be going back to school in a monthâ€™s time. Hopefully. #crossingfingers #screwyoucovid19 #mariianchiasees #mariianchiatravels #throwback
