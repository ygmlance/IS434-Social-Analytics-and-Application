I 💖 electronic dance music.

So watching @AboveandBeyond do their thang onboard a refurbished junk (never been on one) sailing on a seemingly endless Victoria Harbour (not been there for a while 😭) as the sun sets is a real treat! It's essentially EDM + HK + cruise without motion sickness, LOL. Besides the drone footage of the watery environs bordered by an ever-brightening skyline, I also dig the local scenes of daily life the video editor has sprinkled throughout the 1-hour experience. 🙏

Moreover, the split-screen function of my phone—a joy of modern tech—enables me to craft this post while the video is playing. Before it comes to a close, here's a selection of my #StayHome activities for the past 10 days:

Consuming Japanese multimedia
Chastising @realdonaldtrump via IG
Flipping and cleaning my mattress
Watching #PlanetoftheHumans
Enjoying A&B DJ sets (see above)

Donating to an outbreak-related fund
Awaiting @radiohead 'live shows' on YT
Compiling a list of things to (Carou)sell
Contemplating travel review writing
Documenting (wild)life around me
