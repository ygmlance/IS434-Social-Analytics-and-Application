04.05.20 Tea break - Say... B.A.N.A.N.A...🍌 The kids’ Grandpa a.k.a my dad brought us some mangoes and a bunch of baby bananas. It was all good when I realised some of the bananas had started falling off the branch. This mean, we need to eat them up as soon as possible but with 10+ bananas, I doubt we can 😅 So I used half of the quantity and made them into Banana crumble muffins! Both kids love these muffins with the 👦🏻 asking if he could eat 1 more 😆 Recipe is adopted from one of my favourite baker @ankko__ #whatibaked #whatimade #teabreak #baking #homemade #homebaker #bananacrumblemuffins #muffins #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #橘子麻麻的廚房 #自己做 #烘培 #香蕉脆皮馬芬蛋糕 #防疫 #隔離生活 #煮婦人生
