| CB ~ Day 25, part 2 | thai #tomyum soup
Blessed with a surprise Thai food dinner on Sunday - a thoughtful #carepackage from a long-time friend who wanted to send us a food gift.
.
It came with a bowl of Hot & Spicy Clear Tom Yum Soup with a good serving of straw mushrooms and fresh, well-seasoned chicken chunks. The Tom Yum Soup was redolent of all the Thai aromatics which brought an array of sunshine on a gloomy day. It reminded me so much of the first Tom Yum Soup I ever tasted at a heritage Thai restaurant; sweet, sour, aromatic and punchy all at once. Definitely an appetite-pleaser, can you smell the aroma?
.
Accompanied with Shrimp Paste Fried Rice - something I've always yearned for but can't seem to find a good, authentic one that I like. Brimming with prawns and squid, it ticked all the right boxes. Well-executed with great 'wok-hei' finesse and tantalising sambal belachan heat (see 7 posts back).
.
Washed down with a cup of Iced Lemongrass Tea. So fresh and fragrant.
