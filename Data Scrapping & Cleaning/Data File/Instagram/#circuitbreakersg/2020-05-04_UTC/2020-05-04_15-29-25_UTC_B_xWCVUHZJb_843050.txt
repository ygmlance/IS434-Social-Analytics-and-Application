A lovely surprise that came knocking on my door this morning while I was having Zoom class with the little girl. 2 early Mother’s Day bouquets from the kids, by the Hubz.

It’s only in the afternoon when I finally sat down for a breather, that I took a closer look at the bouquets. These were dried flowers! It was then that I recalled I had made a passing remark recently that I would prefer dried flowers these days so I could use them to liven up the house. And this time dried flowers it is!

Thank you for listening to me, even when I think it’s trivial. The past month has been a challenging one that I’ve felt hard pressed on all sides, but you always remind me that I’m not alone. ❤️❤️❤️ What a beautiful way to start the holidays! .
