“This is home, truly, where I know I must be.” Sad but true, this may not be so for everyone. 
Domestic violence has been on the rise globally due to lockdowns and increased time spent at home, and Singapore has not been spared. However, it could be difficult to know what Domestic Violence looks like, how to seek help and what we can do collectively as a community. This visual has been prepared to help everyone know more, in a succinct manner. 
Let’s look out for one another during this Circuit Breaker. If you are or someone you know is experiencing family violence, seek help.
