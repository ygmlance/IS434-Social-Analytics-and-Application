At 5pm the doorbell rang while I was still working and my parent was at the door. Sending lauk #kariikankuraumasin 
They are bored, one has just retired and with the #circuitbreakersg the only activity they enjoy together is cook. And being them, they always find excuse to leave the house, to send food to us daughters. 
Give up scolding them. I can only tell them to avoid crowded places.
