Japanese Curry Rice! Mom marinated while our helper fried the pork and chicken cutlets. I cooked the curry sauce as usual. Adding in a secret ingredient that we learnt from ABC. ðŸ˜œ Yesterdayâ€™s lunch, we tabao-ed dim sum and noodles from Parkwayâ€™s Imperial Treasure. #circuitbreakersg #dinner #homecooking
