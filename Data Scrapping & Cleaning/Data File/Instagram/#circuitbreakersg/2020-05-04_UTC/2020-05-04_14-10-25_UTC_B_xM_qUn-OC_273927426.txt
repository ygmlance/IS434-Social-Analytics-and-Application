At the country level, looking at the statistics, it reflects the slip ups and how detrimental over confidence can lead to.

At a corporation level, not all major corporations are BCP ready for office jobs to WFH.

At a personal level, parents get to bond more with kids, run that little extra laundry and cleaning at home, while still at the laptop but also working longer hours.

But every cloud with a silver lining. We will probably all turn out to be better cooks than before and moving alot more of our groceries online for efficiency. I know alot of us are reprioritizing priorities too after this circuit breaker, knowing what's more important to us now. .

Mummies double hatting as SAHM and Working Mum, the struggles are real. Hang in there. Though I already can't differentiate the weekdays from my weekends, the light is at the end of the tunnel as today is the last day of HBL with kids. May the force with you!

Whilst this circuit breaker extension should not have happened, I'm going to embrace every minute with my kid, while this last. How often do you get to work and have kids with you at the same time?
