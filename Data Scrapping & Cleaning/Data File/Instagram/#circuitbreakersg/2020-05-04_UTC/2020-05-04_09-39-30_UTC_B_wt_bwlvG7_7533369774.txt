#throwback🔙 to January 2020 when our office became very #hengonghuat with the Lunar New Year decorations 🍍🧧🍊. Another month of the Circuit Breaker measures, and it is more important than ever to stay safe and stay home to protect the vulnerable.

Let's continue to work together and flatten the curve so that this ends soon and we can see our friends, families and colleagues, and enjoy the things we once took for granted (even the small things like decorating our office 🙊).
