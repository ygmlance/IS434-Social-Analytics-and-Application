Circuit Breaker🔌 Day 28 / Star Wars Day 2020:
May 4th 2020. Today would have been the day the original Circuit Breaker🔌 would have ended.

But no, that did not happen.

In times like this, Grand Jedi Master Yoda would have said, "No longer certain, that one ever does win a war, I am. For in fighting the battles, the bloodshed, already lost we have. Yet, open to us a path remains. That unknown to the Sith is. Through this path, victory we may yet find. Not victory in the Clone Wars, but victory for all time." Victory we may yet find. Not the victory to celebrate the impending end of the Circuit Breaker, but victory for all time against the Coronavirus🦠. Nonetheless, for all the Jedis and young Padawans out there who are still fighting on - May The Force Be With You!⚔️🛡️💪 #StarWarsDay2020 #StarWarsDay #MayTheForceBeWithYou #MayThe4thBeWithYou #MayTheFourthBeWithYou #SGUnited #COVID19 #FightThisPandemic #CircuitBreaker #CircuitBreakerSG #CourageToCareSG #CareToGoBeyondSG #AlliedHealth #AlliedHealthSG #Rehab #RehabSG #Healthcare #HealthcareSG
