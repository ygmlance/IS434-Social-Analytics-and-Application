In The Sound of Music, Maria made a journey to Captain Von Trapp’s home, In The Sound of Myself, I made a weekly journey to grocery shopping during circuit breaker in Singapore. “I Have Confidence” is my most favourite song in the entire musical and I like Julie Andrew’s movie version the most, so here it is, in the style of the movie. 
This shall be my memory of once upon a time in my life to “Stay Safe, 
Stay Home!” #circuitbreakersg #staysafestayhome #singingcover #musicaltheatre #thesoundofmusic
