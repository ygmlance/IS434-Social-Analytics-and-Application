Day 27. Last day of HBL. Woke up to a morning shower. We took it as a shower of blessings. ðŸ˜‚ An interesting sky colour. Breakfast - A no carbo diet (cos we forgot to buy bread)- mushrooms and bacon omelette, avocado puree, grapefuit and kiwi fruits. Late lunch - Air-fried  lemon and spicy mid-wings, broccoli and multi-grain. The day ends well. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #spendingtimewithfamily #instadaily
