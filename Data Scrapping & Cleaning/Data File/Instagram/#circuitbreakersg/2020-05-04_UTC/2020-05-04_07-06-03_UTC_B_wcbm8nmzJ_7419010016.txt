Get your child to learn about how mucus and phlegm trap germs through playing with slime. Make your own chemical-free and edible slime with just a few ingredients! 
You will need:
1) 1/4 cup chia seeds
2) 1 and 3/4 cups water
3) Food coloring
4) 3 to 4 cups of corn flour 
Step 1: Mix the water, Chia seeds and food colouring together, and refrigerate mixture overnight. 
Step 2: When ready to play, add 3 to 4 cups of corn flour. 
Step 3: Keep kneading and stop adding corn flour once slime mixture stops being wet and can be easily peeled off hands.

Allow the younger kids to immerse and explore the different textures through this sensory experience. For the older kids, you can extend their learning by explaining that the chia seeds act like germs that enter our bodies. The slime works like our mucus/phlegm, which trap the germs and remove them from our body as we sneeze or cough. These reactions protect us by preventing germs from entering our body which may cause infections.

Disclaimer: As this is an extremely sensory activity, reactions may vary from child to child. You can try providing tools like spoons and shovels if your child is afraid to touch the slime. 
Once again, do tag us if you tried the activity to share with us how your kids react to the slime!
