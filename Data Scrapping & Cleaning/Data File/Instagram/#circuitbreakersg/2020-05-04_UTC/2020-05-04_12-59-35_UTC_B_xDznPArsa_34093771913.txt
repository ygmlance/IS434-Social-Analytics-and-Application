Saturday nights, light grey Silverado
Drive it cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom •

I remember telling @myngggs that I don’t like Khalid’s songs and everything of his, sounds so gloomy. Here I am, 3 years later, eating my words and doing a cover of his song. 
I still find the lyrics gloomy but it’s a good song. 
Enjoy your Monday Night!
