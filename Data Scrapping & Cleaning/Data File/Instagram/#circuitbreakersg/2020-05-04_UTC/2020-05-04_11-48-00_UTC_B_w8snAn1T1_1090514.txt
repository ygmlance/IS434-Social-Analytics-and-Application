The chicken stroganoff that did me in. Because the supermarkets ran out of fettuccine! .

What was supposed to be a 30-minute one pot dish turned into a 1.5 hour endeavour because I had to make pasta from scratch. It just takes flour and eggs to make pasta, so I thought, “I got this”. But no, I didn’t. Just so you know, making pasta from scratch without a machine is way harder than it looks. Almost killed me. I had to enlist @josho1981 ‘s (thanks babe) help because kneading the dough and rolling it thin both required more strength than I could ever muster in this lifetime. .

Anyhow, good thing the dish turned out well. I would have been so pissed if it didn’t after all that effort! #quarantinedays #lockdowndiaries #circuitbreakersg #covid_19 #whatsesthercookin
