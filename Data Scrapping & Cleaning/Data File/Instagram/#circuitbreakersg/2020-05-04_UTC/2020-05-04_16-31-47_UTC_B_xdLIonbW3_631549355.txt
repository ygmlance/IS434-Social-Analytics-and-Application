°•○●PISTACHIO PESTO●○•°
We should really just call this pistachio pesto the magic green sauce because it literally elevates everything you put on it.
This pistachio pesto has a bit of heat incorporated with it and it’s just so luxe.
Luxe like something you would find in a fancy restaurant over a giant piece of steak or a little ramekin that is included in your dinner with crusty bread.
I looooove pesto so much. It’s just one of those sauces that you can literally put on anything and it’ll instantly make that dish, vegetable, whatever, that much better.
Like I said, MAGIC SAUCE.
