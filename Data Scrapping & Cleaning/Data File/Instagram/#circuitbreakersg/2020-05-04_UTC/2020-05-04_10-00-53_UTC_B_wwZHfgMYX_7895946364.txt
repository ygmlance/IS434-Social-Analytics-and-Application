Has Circuit Breaker sent you on a binge-eating frenzy? If you’re guilty, (don’t worry, many of us are too), you need NomadX Connect. ⁠
⁠
NomadX Connect is a series of activities organised by us to bring like-minded folks together to connect and clock in one heck of a solid workout at the same time. ⁠
⁠
Back by popular demand, join Jiamin (@jyanyoga) virtually as she conducts yoga lessons during this stressful period. Classes are scheduled at 6:30 PM every Wednesday from now throughout May and they’re free! ⁠
