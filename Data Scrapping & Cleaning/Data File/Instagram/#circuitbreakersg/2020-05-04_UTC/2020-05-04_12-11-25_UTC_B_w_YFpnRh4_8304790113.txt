[Day 23] Funtime Challenge Theme: Love ❤️
.
.
“Love is like a precious plant. You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself. You've got to keep on watering it. You've got to really look after it and nurture it.” - John Lennon .
.
We had some sensory rice art fun with our love theme! The set up is simple but so much fun. First, i cut some heart shapes out from Kraft paper. Then, glue was applied onto the cut outs! Lastly, it’s sprinkle time for the little one. .
.
✨Tada! And the rainbow heart is ready.✨
.
.
P.S.: After the rainbow rice hearts were done, sealed them with more glue and let dry. You can paste them onto cardboard and create some lovely Mother’s Day card for grandma!
