May the fourth be with me! 😜 Homemade brunch treat to self today. Lucky the sunny side-up turned out well with the yoke still runny but not raw. Wasn’t expecting this picture in such eventuality,  but it was spontaneous assembling and therapeutic to just have fun with creativity during this CB period. And because it’s my birthday so it makes this brunch all the more ‘special’ since we are all now ‘confined’ at home. Nonetheless even in this challenging times, God has been good and provided even more in abundance than ever! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️
“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Matthew 6:25-26
