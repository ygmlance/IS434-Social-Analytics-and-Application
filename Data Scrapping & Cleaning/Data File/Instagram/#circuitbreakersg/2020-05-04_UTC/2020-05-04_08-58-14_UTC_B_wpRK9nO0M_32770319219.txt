It's nearing a month of staying apart... We hope you've liked our weekly art features so far! Many have asked us how to submit your art works, performances or livestreams.
.
ðŸ‘‰ Check out our guidelines on how to submit your works at https://www.apart.sg/guidelines
.
We look forward to receiving your submissions so we can share more of these works to everyone - let the arts bring us together while we continue to stay home this May!
