A throwback photo of our time in Kenya, when Ashepa was just starting up. Gazing into the distance where we watched giraffes and zebras gently striding across the plains. Soaking up the African sun, the glorious greens and sounds of nature. 
We had originally planned to be in Kenya this month, working with our artisans on our new collection. This might not be possible, but we are finding new ways of connecting and collaborating. Safely and creatively. 
Looking back, we would be lying if we said we expected Ashepa to be successful enough to have a team of artisans. It had been a rollercoaster ride but we are proud to represent Africa and give our artisans a chance to earn a fair income from their craftsmanship. 
Please check out our website and their beautifully unique pieces. They make wonderful gifts for you, your family and your friends. The team (!) really appreciate your support.
