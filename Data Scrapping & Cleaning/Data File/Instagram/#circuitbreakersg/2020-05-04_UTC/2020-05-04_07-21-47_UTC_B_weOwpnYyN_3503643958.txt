Incredibly, Brazil nuts have more selenium than any other food! Just one to two a day will supply the recommended daily intake for adults (55mcg). Selenium is an essential mineral that is vital for your immune system, thyroid gland, and cell growth. Brazil nuts are also beneficial to the body in many other ways such as supporting thyroid function, lowering the risk of heart disease, and boosting the bodyâ€™s antioxidant system.

Brazil nuts may provide some impressive health benefits, but it is best to eat them in moderation as too much can result in selenium toxicity.
