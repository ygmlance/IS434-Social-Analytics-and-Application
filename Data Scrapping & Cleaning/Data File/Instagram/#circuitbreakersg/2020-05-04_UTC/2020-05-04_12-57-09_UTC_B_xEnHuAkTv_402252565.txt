Mother’s Day is going to be quite different this year. As we see Covid19 pandemic evolves and circuit breaker measures in Singapore extended, Mother’s Day family outings to brunch/high tea/buffet, family get-togethers in homes with in-person hugs and kisses will have to be postponed to probably year 2021, especially for those of us who don’t have our moms staying under the same household😢But this doesn’t mean Mother’s Day has to be canceled this year 💕What’s your creative celebration / gifting plan for this special Mother’s Day? 😍
