The Moms said she felt like having a dish that she could eat alongside mash. Naturally my mind went to a comforting braised meat dish (last time I made this, we had it with pasta). .
.
I’m not much of a drinker at home, but this braise is soo good that I keep a bottle or two or red handy just in case the supermarkets have some nice stewing cuts in stock. Mash was the requested base, so that’s what I did.

I decided to go decadent this time and made a lusciously rich mash (I use granola potatoes) enriched with butter and milk that I had infused with some rosemary and black garlic. I also decided to scrap the skins (which I normally keep), topped it with some grated gruyere; touched it to melt/brown the top which also brought out some of the oils in the cheese. .
.
Let’s just say, we rolled back to our respective rooms after polishing off our plates.
