Demon Guardian in Wat Phra Kaew Grand Palace 📍Bangkok, Thailand
..
Wat Phra Kaew, Temple of the Emerald Buddha and is within the precincts of the Grand Palace.
..
One of the most important Buddhist temples in Thailand, located in Bangkok’s cultural centre.
..
Artwork and architecture of the temple and grand place is very beautiful.
..
The first sights you'll see upon entering Wat Phra Kaew are two 5m-guardian demons/yaksha with origins in Hindu/Buddhist mythology.
..
The Emerald Buddha in this temple is only about two feet tall, it is one of the most significant buddhas to the Thai people. It is believed that worshipping the Emerald Buddha will bring good luck.
