Day27 of #circuitbreakersg : ✨ Life is the collection of Memories ✨

It is dream to every child to make their parents happy and proud at one point in life, though for some it happens early in lifetime and rest in the later but nevertheless every child strives at its best to make it happen. I’m so happy finally my parents visited us here and the timelane of around 3 weeks is so precious and to be cherished for lifetime. Don’t lose your hope if something doesn’t happen the time we are expecting it bcoz at the RIGHT time RIGHT things will fall in place 😇. This happened in last December that too when the very auspicious new beginning of life came into our lives so grateful and blessed🧚🏻‍♀️. After working tirelessly over the last long weekend, today been tired so much. Thus prepared the most comforting #breakfast and #lunch 😴
