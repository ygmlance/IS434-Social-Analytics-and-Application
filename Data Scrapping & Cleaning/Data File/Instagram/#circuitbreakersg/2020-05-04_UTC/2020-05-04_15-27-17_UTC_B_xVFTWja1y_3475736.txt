Day 28 of circuit breaker, it ABC time. Since young, I have been showing Leodys ABC flashcard or book every few days. Recently it show result. He started to read some alphabet letters when I am setting up his ABC magnet. The actual video is longer than 1 minute but he got tired of saying the letter for the behind letter so I cut it off. Leodys, you are growing well. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #hbl #homebasedlearning #abc #abcreading #atoz #wfh #stayhomsg #stayhomforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #hangonmonz
