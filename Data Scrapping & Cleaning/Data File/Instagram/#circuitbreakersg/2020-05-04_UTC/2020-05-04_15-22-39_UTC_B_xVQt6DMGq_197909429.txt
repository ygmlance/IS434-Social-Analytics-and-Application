We usually have iftar with extended family at @furamasingapore every year. As you know, this year is different.
.
But the kind folks at Tiffany Cafe made sure we didn’t miss them too much. This time, they came bearing Mediterranean & Asian Ramadan sets, something for everyone in the family.
.
We had 2 sets for 2 people. What. A. Feast.
.
There was mee goreng, chicken rendang, stir fried fish with ginger & spring onion, seasonal vegetables, mango pudding, baked pasta, chicken kebab, baked salmon, tiramisu... I can’t even list them all.
.
More than enough for a family of 5, for iftar AND sahur. And my friends know, my kids can eat.
.
So grateful for the beautiful spread. You can order for pick up or delivery, easy peasy, at furamacitycentre.oddle.me
