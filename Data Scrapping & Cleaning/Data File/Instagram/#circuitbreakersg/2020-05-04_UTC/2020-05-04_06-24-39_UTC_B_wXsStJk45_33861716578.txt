Soymilk Grass Jelly with Taro Balls | 豆奶仙草芋圆｜

When dessert stores are closed during CB, you make your own dessert! Recipe inspiration from @cookwithsusan 🥰. This recipe has a lot of agaration. This is one recipe that you gotta cook by feel. And.. no kitchen cheats for this recipe. #cannotcheattheprocess

Making of Taro Balls 
1. Cut taro and sweet potatoes into small cubes. Steam & mash them. 
2. Add 2-3 spoons of sugar while they’re still hot. 
3. Add in tapioca flour. We don’t have a fix ratio. The amount of flour required for taro and sweet potatoes is different. Start with little, add more as your knead. 
4. Knead to form a soft ball, add more flour if your mixture is too wet and more water if the mixture is too dry.
5. Different amount of flour creates different texture. More flour = more chewy.
6. Roll them. If it doesn’t crumble and doesn’t stick to the surface, you’re good to cut them into small bites. 
7. Dust them with corn flour to avoid them sticking to one another.

This is good if you have excess of taro/ sweet potatoes. You keep the taro balls frozen up to 1-2 months!

Cooking of Taro Balls
1. Heat water until boiling point. 
2. Put taro balls into boiling water. 
3. Remove them once they float. 
4. Put them in cold water for extra chewiness.

Serving Ideas for Taro Balls
Taro balls can be served with so many different desserts! They’re like tangyuan! We served ours with Soymilk and Grass Jelly (Cincao). 1. Soymilk made by my bro 😋 , can always get packet soymilk. 
2. Dice ready-to-eat Cincao 
3. Put Cincao & Taro Balls into the serving bowl. Pour in the soymilk. 
4. We added honey because our homemade soymilk is non-sweetened. .
