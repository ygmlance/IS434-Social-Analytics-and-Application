We know today was supposedly the last day of #circuitbreakersg.... but Singapore, hang in there! 🇸🇬| This is officially our first music cover together as a band and during this crucial time we have chosen the song "Home" by Kit Chan to remind Singapore to stay strong together during this period and also to thank the Singapore Government, our frontliners and everyone who played their part during the Circuit Breaker to help alleviate the covid-19 situation in Singapore. ♥️ |

Bringing you a FreshOuttaBedSg production from the comfort of our own homes!🏡 |
We hope that you all enjoy this one.🙆🏻‍♀️ |
Don't forget to like and share too! ✌🏼|
