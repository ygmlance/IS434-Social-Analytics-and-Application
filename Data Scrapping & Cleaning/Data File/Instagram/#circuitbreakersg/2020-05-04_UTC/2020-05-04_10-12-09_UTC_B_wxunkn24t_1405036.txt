Day 28.

Thankful to have the extended family all making time to come online and sing a birthday song for our little one!

Some were technically challenged. Some made contactless deliveries of gifts to our home. Some made time for a trial run to make sure things will run smoothly.

So much love is given to this little one of ours!! Family is the best!
