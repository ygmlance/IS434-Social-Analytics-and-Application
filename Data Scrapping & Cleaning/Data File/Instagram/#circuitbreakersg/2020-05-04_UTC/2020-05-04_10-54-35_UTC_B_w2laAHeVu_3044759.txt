During the 2nd week of CB, I thought since I have time, I shld try to DIY a mask. .

Last Fri, I finally get down to it. I picked an old skirt with pleats, thinking it'll be easier but it proofs otherwise 🤣

Anw I realised I need to iron out the existing lines, I ended up putting aside cos I'll br working over the weekend. .

Today I finally decided to get it over & done with but at the end of it then only I realised the rubber band is sewed wrong direction & had to re-do again 🤦🏻‍♀️ Re-do it & tada~~ my handsew mask! 
A little tight but I think it's ok since this will be in use only when I go buy 7-11 to buy breakfast/ ShengSiong to buy groceries & yet don't wanna waste 1 surgical mask .
