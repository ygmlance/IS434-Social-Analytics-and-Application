Throwback to an exploration at @hubersbutchery 2 months ago (at the beginning of March, before the semi-lockdown started in April and the world changed beyond recognition). How I miss those days when we could wander around to shop for food ingredients, and have unlimited scope of ingredients with which to cook our next meal. Those days seem so long ago.
.
Hope we return to normality soon, or as close to normal as we can manage, in such a time. Stay home and stay safe, everyone!
