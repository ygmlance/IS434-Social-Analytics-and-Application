Not trying to start a gambling den here; just getting more card decks for my grip strength training 💪🏼

𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗴𝘁𝗵 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹. While this may sound odd to some, who draw a clear distinction between strength and skill, the reality is less straightforward. The generation of strength begins in the nervous system, which sends signals to our muscles for them to contract. This can be seen as a skill in itself, which gets better with practice. ⁣
⁣
And then there is the application of strength. How to position the body and joints, in what direction to push or pull, etc. These are aspects more traditionally thought of as skill, which also gets better with practice.
⁣
Your actual strength with regards to any particular function is the amount of potential strength from your strength generation capacity that you can effectively apply. This is why even people who are generally strong sometimes struggle with new movements - they lack the skill to apply their strength in specific ways that they are as-yet unfamiliar with.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲. If you want to get stronger, you can do something as simple as tensing your muscles as hard as you can, even without any external resistance. Over time you will be able to generate stronger contractions, which translate into greater strength output.
⁣
And if you want to get better at doing something in particular, practise as specifically as possible. Of course you can throw in some forms of accessory work, but it's difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate the need for specific practice.

Which brings me back to these cards I bought. My goal is to be able to tear a full deck of playing cards with my bare hands. While I've been doing other forms of grip work, I still have to adhere to the principle of specificity. So there goes 4x$1.80 for my hobby.
