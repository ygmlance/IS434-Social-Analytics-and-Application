How's your CB?
.
What have you been doing this whole Circuit Breaker?
.
Me, struggling with work-life-balance as well as time management for games and housechores. .
.
Being a usually productive person, I would have thought that I will create a lot more creation than I do now, at home.
.
It's more like majority of my time were being used by work from home, cooking and dish washing. 🤣🤣
