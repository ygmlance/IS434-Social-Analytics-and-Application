[#TheHedgehogAtHome/ #Recipe] Finally managed to cafe-hop... to my dining table! 🤣 Here's my perfect breakfast with creamy Scrambled Egg with Cheese, multigrain toast, avos and berries. Also some @MissionFoods.SG Corn Strips for added crunch. Swipe ⬅️ for more pics.
.
I paired my breakfast with @TWGTeaOfficial's Sencha green tea. Do you prefer coffee or tea in the morning? 😋 Have a great week ahead! It's another short week for us here in Singapore 🇸🇬.
