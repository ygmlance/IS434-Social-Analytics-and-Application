Day 28 of #circuitbreakersg
.
Old Town or New Town? According to UNESCO, both are highly recommended as the harmonious juxtaposition of these two contrasting historic areas gives the city its unique character.
.
The Old Town is filled with many crisscrossing streets and narrow wynds leading to courtyards. On the opposite end, the New Town has an articulate collection of carefully planned buildings, and is populated by uptown retail stores.
.
Our stay had a perfect view of the New Town, and a night photo would definitely justify its beauty better.
