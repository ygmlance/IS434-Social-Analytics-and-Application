My K1 baby girl packed a pencil case last night and exclaimed that she's ready for primary school. The word search book that we bought just before the circuit breaker has come to good use~ it didn't keep her occupied for long though ðŸ˜… The word search book is for her big sis but she's just not into her own phonics activity book.

Chicky pants tailored by mum-in-law, cloth design picked by big girl. The girls have one or two pairs each... I can't remember. ðŸ˜…
