i am reminded today about the importance of good produce. despite the rather pink appearance of this steak suggesting its medium doneness, this striploin was a real workout for the jaw and the muscles of mastication. not to knock on cheap meats, but when you pay $12 for a 500g cut of striploin, a high marbling score is probably the last thing to expect. 
that said, i did enjoy the beefy flavour of the meat and the added aromatics (rosemary, thyme, garlic) were quite fragrant. paired with a mound of caramelized onions, it was quite a treat.
also happy that i got to make mcdonald’s-style skinny fries. i don’t think a pan-fried chip will ever be as crisp as a double deep-fried one, but i think i managed to get about 50% of the way there! there can only be room for improvement!
