May the Fourth: Circuit breaker was supposedly to end this day. Instead of going back to school, holiday swapped in. Home based learning baton over to home based holiday. I was initially full of faith about breaking the first part of circuit breaker on time, but circumstances threw in the ‘buy 1 get 1 free.’ Our kids were overjoyed until they found out there’s a holiday swap. A perfect explanation of 先甜后苦, taste the sweetness before bitterness.

We are midway through, and we will reach the finish line in no time. May the Force be with you! And me!
