Day 27 HBL = Day 28 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Squat with single arm row
#7dayabchallenge

Tried another 45 min Hasfit Tabata Training with weights and it was brutal... Oh man.. 3 min warm up, into the workout and 5 min cool down. Still not sure which one I refer... I'll try another version next time. 
And I'm a true blue #blogilates fan still, I started their 7 Days Abs Challenge and its not easy.. Haha.. Need another 20 min of workout time.. Most of you will cheer me on, thanks! 
It's Monday and last day of HBL! Woohoo.. (but my work still continues ok) 
And its May 4 so... May the 4th be with you to  #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
