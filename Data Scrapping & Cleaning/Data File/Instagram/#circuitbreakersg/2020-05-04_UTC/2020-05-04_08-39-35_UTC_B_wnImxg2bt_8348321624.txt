Lemongrass Pandan Tea is loaded with antioxidants, helps to reduce cholesterol and induces a feeling of relaxation. There are so many health benefits. I love both the aroma of lemongrass and pandan leaves so boiling them together is a nice and powerful combination. I added peach gum to this drink and skipped sweetener. ⁣
