WEEK 8 AT HOME 🏠
.
Good news, I am not going batty. In fact (dare I say) I quite enjoy being at home. I’m getting used to:
.
👩🏽‍💻 working from home
🥊 my kids constantly fighting
👩🏽‍🍳cooking meals that don’t suck
🏠 the upstairs neighbours apparently skipping 24/7 in their lounge
🤸🏽‍♂️finding time to move my body Everyday
💇‍♀️ my hair looking like dry, sad, matted curls
💄 not wearing any makeup ever
☕️ making my own coffee instead of buying
🧳 maintaining a list of places we will travel to whenever things go back to normal
🏃🏽‍♀️daily walks and runs (half the time I choose to run just so I don’t have to wear a mask)
🐶 my dog liking me the most out of everyone in the house for the FIRST TIME
.

We’re in this for another month, so tell me... what are your positives during this period? I know lots of things suck for many people, but what little things are you finding enjoyment in? ⬇️
