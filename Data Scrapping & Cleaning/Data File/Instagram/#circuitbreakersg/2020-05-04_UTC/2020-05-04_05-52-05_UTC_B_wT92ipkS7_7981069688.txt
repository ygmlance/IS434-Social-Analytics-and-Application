Anthony Williams - Life Time, 1964. Tony was just 18 when he recorded this album as lead. Just a year ago he joined Miles Davis second quintet after impressing with his cutting-edge approach to drumming. 1964 was the year when several iconic avant-garde albums were released like Eric Dolphy’s Out To Lunch, Sam Rivers’ Fuschia Swing Song and Tony was involved in all of them! Well this is his album and he’s joined by a serious post-bop lineup. Dive into the unpredictability of free jazz right here!  #anthonywilliams #lifetime #samrivers #herbiehancock #bobbyhutcherson #richarddavis #garypeacock #roncarter #bluenoterecords
