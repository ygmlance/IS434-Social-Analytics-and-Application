Covid has changed me. Never thought I could get so much pleasure out of a pencil and an eraser. Never have I ever doodled for such an extended period of time. Didn’t even draw much as a kid. You know that carefree feeling of dance like you don’t care, this is how I feel these days. I started these doodlings with the disclaimer I can’t draw. Now I really don’t care. I usually run away from social media. But I am actually enjoying instragram and along with the way, I have ‘met’ some cool people who share their art, their pets, crafts, their food and for a few minutes in the day, I forget I am stuck at home like you guys. Thank you. CB#28 #sgcares #sgunited #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #overcomeasone #stayathomesg #bunny #bunnylove #rabbit
