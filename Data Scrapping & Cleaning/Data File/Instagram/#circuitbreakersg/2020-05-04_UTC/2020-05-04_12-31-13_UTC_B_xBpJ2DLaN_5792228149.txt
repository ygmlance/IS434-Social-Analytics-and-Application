So tired from work that I didnâ€™t bother to cook rice. Fried a bowl of cabbage with dried shrimps and garlic, and flavoured a can of peanut stew with herbs and chilli flakes. But these are also perfect to go with a small espresso cup of Japanese peach wine. #needtounwind #covid19 #circuitbreakersg
