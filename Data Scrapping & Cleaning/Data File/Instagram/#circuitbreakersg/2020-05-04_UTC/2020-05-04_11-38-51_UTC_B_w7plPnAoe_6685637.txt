I haven’t posted anything in forever, and this sketchbook is now finished. It’s covered the whole year since I’ve been in bible school. 
I’ll be posting sketches from this, and some stories of how I drew or just thoughts about the drawings everyday. Something to keep myself going in this time of Circuit Breaker, something to make me work towards. 
I might stack the posts, so there will be a few pictures, like this one is the back and front of the sketchbook. It’s NOT a muji sketchbook so you won’t be able to find it. It’s a stillman and birn, and it can handle watercolor so some of the sketches will have watercolor later. I love the size of it, being small, and it handles ink like a pro.

Sketches coming real soon!
