#STAYHOME (SORTA) RECIPE: Spaghetti alle vongole using Cloudy Bay’s wild New Zealand diamond shell clams from @culinasg (also available via FairPrice). These are sold lightly blanched but still require a fair bit of cooking before they open up to reveal their sweet, clean, briny, plump flesh. Pretty good, though I’d rather get the raw moon shell clams from the same brand next time (those can’t keep as long but boast better texture & flavour). Honestly, I cooked this using instinct & didn’t really follow a recipe. I used lemon juice in place of the usual wine for a change. Here’s my sorta recipe (pls adjust to taste). ********************************************
Clam Pasta (Sorta) Recipe

Serves 4 - 5 pax ********************************************INGREDIENTS:

350g - 400g spaghetti 
2 big bulbs garlic, sliced thinly

1kg clams, washed

2 - 4 tbsp lemon juice + extra to taste

dry chilli flakes, to taste 
a large handful of baby spinach (optional)* 2-3 packets Italian flat leaf parsley, chopped

Sea salt, to taste *********************************************METHOD:

Boil pasta in heavily salted water & follow cooking instructions on packet. Undercook by 2 mins.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil in wok/frying pan over medium-high heat, add garlic and fry till soft and fragrant. Turn up heat to high.

Add clams & stir for bit. Add tomatoes, lemon juice, chilli flakes. Season generously with salt. Cover pan with lid. Stir occasionally till clam shells open. 
Drain & add pasta, plus a coupla spoonfuls of pasta cooking water (leftover from boiling pasta) and a generous drizzle of olive oil.

Throw in spinach if using. Toss to mix, taste & adjust seasoning with more lemon juice, salt (maybe a tiny dash of sugar), if necessary. 
Stir in parsley and allow pasta to cook for another minute or so till it absorbs the clam juices & is al dente. Serve immediately.
