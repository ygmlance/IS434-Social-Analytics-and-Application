Tribajam Goat Curry (reminds me of biryani), Seafood Cakes and Saut√©ed Vegetables from one of our favourite restaurants, @limehouseasia in Outram. We also ordered the Jerk Chicken Skewers (not shown, but really tasty). They are on @deliveroo_sg and @foodpandaasia, but you can also order from their website.
