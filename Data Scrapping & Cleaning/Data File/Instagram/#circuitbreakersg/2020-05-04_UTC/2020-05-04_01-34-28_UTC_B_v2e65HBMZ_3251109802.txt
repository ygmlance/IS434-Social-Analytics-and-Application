Throwback to when we were in the French countryside picking applies in the farm.
⠀⠀
When all this is over, all I want to do is fly and just stay in the countryside for a while.
⠀⠀
I’d like to believe I can adapt anywhere I am planted, but I thrive best when I’m in nature. It’s where I truly blossom and I wish we were with our families in the countryside and gardening together, harvesting the olives and prunes to make olive oil and jam.
⠀⠀
We may not get any time together this summer of 2020, but we will always remember how we fostered solidarity during this time of crisis, way beyond our family units.
⠀⠀
What do you look forward to when all this is over?
