#CircuitBreakerSG D-28 【 Recipe 】
Someone asked can we not have steamed food for tonight 🤭

So... dinner is Tonkatsu with Japanese Curry, served with Japonica Rice. Something that everybody agrees on, happy tummies 😆

Sharing the recipe of Tonkatsu Japanese Curry which my family loves.

Tonkatsu
🔅 Pound pork until tender and marinate overnight with salt, garlic powder & pepper.
🔅 Coat pork with flour, beaten egg & panko breadcrumbs.
🔅 Fry in heated oil for 1 min or so on each side depending on thickness of meat.
🔅 Remove and let it sit for couple of min to cook in the remaining heat.
🔅 Double fry to get the ultimate crispiness.

Japanese Curry
🔅 Brown onion in heated olive oil.
🔅 Add carrot to the pan and cook slightly.
🔅 Add water according to package and let it simmer.
🔅 Add Japanese curry cube and stir till dissolved.
🔅 Ready to serve when the Carrot is cooked to desirable doneness.

Have been cooking 2-3 times a day on top of working from home. Hope to win a Mayer appliance to ease the preparation & cooking process.
