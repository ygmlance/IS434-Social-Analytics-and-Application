Day 28 of #CircuitBreakersg
~~~~~~~~~~
I seriously could eat pasta everyday, especially pasta carbonara! Creamy sauce plus lots of Parmesan cheese and bacon, just these few ingredients  can produce a great meal to uplift the spirits!
.
Because most pasta was sold out, I tried a new size of spaghetti. No. 5 from @SanRemoSG which is way thicker than my usual angel hair but also more “solid” than usual spaghetti it seems. @edward365 liked it so much he had thirds. No regrets!
