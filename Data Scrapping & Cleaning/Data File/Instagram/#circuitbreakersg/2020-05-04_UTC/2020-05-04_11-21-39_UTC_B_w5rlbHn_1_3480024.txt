[Homecooked] Cir Breaker Day 28 Dinner.

My old airfryer was spoilt, so I bought a new one, my second airfryer, and I was reminded of one of the first few dishes that I cooked with the airfryer. 
Decided to make these cheesy prawn and egg tofu balls (in the 2nd photo) again, and they turned out very yummy. Proves the recipe is still a keeper afterall. 
Served them with a chilli mayo dip, and added a side of muar otah and poached Shanghai greens in oyster sauce to complete the meal.
Oh, and those pretty green florets that I used to decorate the cheesy prawn balls platter are actually the stem bases of the shanghai greens, which I cut off since the Mister does not like eating tough vegetable stems. They look like perfect green roses yeh?üòç
