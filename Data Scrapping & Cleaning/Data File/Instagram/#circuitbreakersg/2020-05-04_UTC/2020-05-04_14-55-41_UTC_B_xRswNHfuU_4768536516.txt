May the 4th be with you - 2020 Edition. Saw my Facebook post memory in 2019 and decided to dig the light Sabre out from the cupboard to let this cheeky one play with it. Itâ€™s amazing how much she have grown. I can tie her hair into 2 buns to look like Princess Leia instead of using a towel! More fun (and challenging) days ahead! #funmoments #may4th #starwars #familyfun #stayhome #covid19 #circuitbreakersg @thatunclesam @thatagentm
