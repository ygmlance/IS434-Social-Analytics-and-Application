And so, day 28 of Singapore's COVID-19 "circuit breaker" has finally arrived... Tomorrow was supposed to be the start of work, school and normal life for many until the government decided it was in the best interests of the Singapore community to extend the "circuit breaker"... This is as good an opportunity as any to cook more and clean the house... You see, this Queen of Procrastination can't procrastinate much when I cut off @netflixsg for my own good!  Don't worry, Netflix... I will come back to you soon when the house is clean! üßπ‚ù§Ô∏è
What's for lunch on day 28?  I'm addicted to my low carb egg, cheese, chia seed and coconut flour pancakes!  Served today's ones with tuna onion mayo, lettuce and tomato for @iamivanlau and the Greek in me wanted a dollop of Tzatziki and Taramasalata on mine! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
