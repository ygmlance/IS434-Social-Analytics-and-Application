We have been silent for a few days since we stopped fulfilling orders due to the enhanced COVID-19 measures. Tbh, it felt kind of good to neglect Instagram for a bit although we do have this nagging worry that we will be forgotten in this busy social media world (small business problems) ðŸ˜‚
.
We are still brainstorming on our next steps but for now, we are just contented with writing those long-overdue blogposts, checking out new ceramicists and drinking tea. And yes, more #ceramicistswelove will be back up next week!
.
If you are awaiting some good news from usâ€¦ the next line of products to be uploaded are in the process of being measured and uploaded. Some of you may have already gotten some sneak peeks of it and we are super excited to share this batch with you guys!
