No equipment needed. Just a phone for the workout video, a big towel or exercise mat and 10min of your time (20min if you go two rounds). Just sharing my workout for today which I thought was pretty good for cardio and lower body strength which are important for our paintball game endurance and burst at breakout. Each set was 40 seconds with 10 seconds in between. Those who did this same workout seemed to have found this rather easy but it wasn't easy for me. Haha... well, it can only get better!
