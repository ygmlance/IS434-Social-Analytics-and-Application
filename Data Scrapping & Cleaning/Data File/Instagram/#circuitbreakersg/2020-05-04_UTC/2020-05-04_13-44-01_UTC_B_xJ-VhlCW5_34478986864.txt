This is the first casualty we know of in our area... I'm sure there are many more (also to come ðŸ˜¢) @jekyllandhyde.sg in Tanjong Pagar is closing in June. We had ordered a bottle of lychee martini to show our support, but ultimately, with all the #circuitbreakersg measures, it sure is hard for bars to survive. We have fond memories of being there â€” hope they will surface somewhere else soon!
