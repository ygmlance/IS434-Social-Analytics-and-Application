I made my first Pandan Chiffon Cake! Got the recipe from my Mom and had her guide me over the various steps to make sure I did things right. 
This recipe doesn't have baking powder. But if aerated enough with the meringue, I believe the shape would hold well. 
Baked it for 40 to 45 minutes-ish but the cake was still kind of wet/moist. Supposed timing should have been 50 minutes. So after cooling down and unmoulded, I baked it again. Try not to do that at all since the colour of the cake would change.

Not a perfect cake yet because there's a layer that's still dense. (3rd photo). Gonna try again and with more flavours!!
