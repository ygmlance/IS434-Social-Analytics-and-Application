I received a lot of DMs asking me about our new paddling pool so I thought maybe it’s best I share it in a feed post :)⁣
⁣
We got this Gelato van pool from @amazon.sg at $50.80 (it’s a bit cheaper now but whatever la!). It’s free shipping above $60 for us as we have the Prime membership. If you don’t have, you can sign up for free trial and cancel after if you don’t think you will use it.⁣
⁣
TBH, kids are not those that would sit down and paint or color for a for more than 5-10 min. So this pool has really been a lifesaver since we got it. ⁣
⁣
This CB, it’s been so nice to watch them play together. It’s one activity that they won’t fight at it (oh yes, this pair of siblings fights daily!). They would splash together and does pretend play in their little pool. ⁣
⁣
For now, we use it twice a day at the moment. Morning before Fia’s nap to wear them out and once more before dinner to work up an appetite! Luckily the pool is quite shallow, so the cost of changing water daily won’t be too crazy. ⁣
⁣
Let’s hope they still find this pool exciting by the end of CB. We’re gonna milk this activity as much as we can for now! ⁣
⁣
Oh ya, dm me if you want the link for this pool! Of course, if your apartment is bigger, get the bigger ones!⁣
