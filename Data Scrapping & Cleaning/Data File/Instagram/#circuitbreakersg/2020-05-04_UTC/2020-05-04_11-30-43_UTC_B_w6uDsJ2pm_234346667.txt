【Recipe】it’s been awhile since I last cooked my usual 2 dishes 1 soup dinners. 很久没煮两菜一汤了。

My own rendition of Chap Chye. Since I don’t have dried sweet beancurd and dried lily bulbs, I make do with what I have in the fridge 🙈😁 Honestly those two ingredients gave the most flavour! But we use what we have, not rush out every time we are short of an item. ～忍～ #stayhomestaysafe

Still tasty nonetheless, and I love cabbage anyways haha. 
Spicy silky Mapo tofu for my other dish. Another one of those classic dishes that we’ll never get tired of. 麻婆豆腐
