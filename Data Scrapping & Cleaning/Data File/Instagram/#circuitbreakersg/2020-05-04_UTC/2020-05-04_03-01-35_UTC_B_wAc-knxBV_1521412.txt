Sheldon was so happy when I said, “let’s play a new game, float or sink today!” I got Sheldon to choose what objects he wanted to be part of the game and also got his help to set up. 1.5 hours well spent on this activity! 😊 #sgtoddler #sgbaby #instatoddler #instababy #toddlerfriendly #toddleractivitiesathome #sheldonsim #2yo #29monthsold #activeparentssgchallenge #homebasedlearning #playtolearn #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #floatorsink
