Sweet #sunsettingsky #viewfrommyflat it's the end of 4 weeks of #circuitbreakersg and we are onward to the extension period

As numbers have fallen over the past week, community spread also dropped and contact tracing is much better. We all want easing of restrictions and hopefully we can go back to working and continue to earn our livelihood 
#aprayer for our govt to have the wisdom of the next steps of easing during the extension period before 1 Jun and there will be smooth transition for especially the workers and the self-employed for all sectors. May the gloom over the country be lifted!
