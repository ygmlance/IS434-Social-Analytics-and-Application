#CircuitBreakerSg Day 28! 2nd month into #WFH and #Stayhome! One month to go! Hang on everyone! We can do it! 💪🏻Today’s breakfast I decided to have something healthier! Overnight oat loaded with lots of fruits as I have not been eating much fruits recently. 😋

How I make overnight oat:
1/3 cup whole grain rolled oat
1/3 cup fresh milk
150g plain yogurt
2 tsp chiaseed

1. Mix all together and chill overnight in fridge.
2. To serve, top with fruits and nuts of your choice and a drizzle of honey/maple syrup.
