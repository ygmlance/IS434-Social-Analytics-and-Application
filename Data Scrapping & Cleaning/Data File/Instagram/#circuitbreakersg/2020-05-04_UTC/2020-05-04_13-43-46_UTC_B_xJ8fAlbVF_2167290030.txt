DAY 28 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
POHA CUTLETS

I was scrolling through Insta yesterday and came across a post by @desi_platter It was poha cutlets. Although the cultlets are not made with cooked poha, I asked her if I could use my leftover cooked poha. Thankyou Mugdha, for the recipe, the tikkis were really good. 
I added boiled & mashed potato, grated ginger, green chilli, coriander, chat masala  and salt to the leftover poha (yesterdays post). Made tikkis and shallow fried it. 
Super good way to use left-over poha ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
