So a few weeks ago, a friend of mine challenged me to write an original haiku for my daily calligraphy! Took me awhile but here we go ðŸ˜„ also, youâ€™ll get a triple whammy of calligraphy today since I missed out on posting for the past 2 days haha. Let me know if you guys like my humble poetic attempt! #handletteringdaily #haikupoetry #circuitbreakersg #lifeinthetimeofcorona
