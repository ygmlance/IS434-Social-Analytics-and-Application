✈️ DOODLES ON PLANE ✈️ HuHa were still active and I needed them to wind down before their bedtime 🛌 Instead of our routine reading 📖 of books 📚, I wanted them to doodle ✍🏼 their thoughts 💭 Since doodling helps our little ones express their emotions, improve their focus, builds memory power and honestly I was intrigued by daily @greg.o.doodles entries 💕
.

It has been a while since we last doodled and I felt it was timely to include it as a part of our wind down routine. Hu took the lead as teacher and I listened to all his instructions as the obedient student except for the spelling part 🤣. Ha also had her fun of doodling and poking the paper 📝 
We doodled about home 🏠, myself 👩🏻, himself 👦🏻, elephant 🐘, cat 🐱, ball 🎾, jet ✈️, Hu's Spider-Man 🕸 water bottle and ice. Once Hu was done with his doodles, he folded it into a paper plane ✈️ to test his throwing skills before we called it a day 💕
Happy weekends guy and stay safe always 💕
