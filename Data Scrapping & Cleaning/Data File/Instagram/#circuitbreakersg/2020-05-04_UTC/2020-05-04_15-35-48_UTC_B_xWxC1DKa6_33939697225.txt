Lunch was a simple affair today. I converted the leftover meatball sauce from yesterday into a creamy pomodoro sauce, served on top of the Simlets' favourite alphabet pasta. Topped with the remaining meatballs. Voila, lunch is served. #simletseat #homemadefood #sghomecook #toddlerfood #healthykidsfood #instafood #ikeameatballs #pomodoro #pasta #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
