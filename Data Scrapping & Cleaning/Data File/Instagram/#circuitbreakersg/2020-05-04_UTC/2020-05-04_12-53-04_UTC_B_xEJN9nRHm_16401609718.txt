🧪 INVISIBLE INK 🧪 
First you don’t see it, next you do! Is it magic?
Decided to incorporate #everydayscience 🧪to our Mother's Day activity for some #messyplay fun! 👏 .

All you need is water 💦, baking soda, turmeric, rubbing alcohol, paint brush and paper. We didn’t bother with exact measurements and went with the flow instead just like how we did previously. 
But for those who prefers measurement here it goes:
Water 💦 (1/2 cup)
Baking soda (1 tablespoon)
Rubbing alcohol (1/2 cup)
Turmeric (1 teaspoon)
Qtips or brush
Paper
.

We did this fun science "magic" last September as well and it was a big hit with Hu. 
Mixing a base (baking soda) and an acid (alcohol) together creates a chemical reaction. The chemical reaction causes a change in the color making the invisible message appear. Turmeric is a natural pH indicator. It changes colour when reacts with a base which results in the secret message to turn red/purple in colour 💕
Happy experimenting with your little ones💕
