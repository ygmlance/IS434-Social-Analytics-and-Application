One of the best we've had so far 😍 Black pepper crayfish (same flavor as crab, but no need to peel!), golden fragrance prawns, salted egg chicken, sambal fried rice, salted fish bean sprouts and fluffy fried mantous from @momma_kongs in Chinatown. Awesome local flavors! Order from their website (oddle). #sgfoodie #sgeats #singaporerestaurant #circuitbreakersg #savefnbsg #sgdelivery #onemealaday
