Saltine toffee bark with cranberries and almonds! Now a favourite with my family. It looks and tastes deceptively fancy but it's so easy you will literally go like this ?üòê? ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
It's basically a crunchy saltine cracker layered with gooey (or crunchy - up to you) caramel, chocolate, and whatever toppings you like. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
1. For the caramel: melt a cup of sugar in a pan, then add cold butter chunks. If you like your caramel kind of like crunchy candy, stop here.‚Å£‚Å£
2. If you like chewy caramel add a splash of heavy cream. ‚Å£‚Å£
3. Place saltine crackers in a single layer on a baking sheet, then pour caramel over it. Spread so it's even bc no one wants a cookie with no caramel‚Å£‚Å£
4. Bake for 5 mins at 130c/270f ‚Å£‚Å£
5. Take tray out and scatter chocolate chips all over. They should melt. Spread spread spread. Sprinkle on toppings while chocolate is melty so they stick. Chill in fridge, or if you have no space bc quarantine, chill it under your AC or fan it impatiently. ‚Å£‚Å£
6. Crack it into ~organic shapes~ and pretend you bought it from Dempsey hill for $25 ‚Å£
