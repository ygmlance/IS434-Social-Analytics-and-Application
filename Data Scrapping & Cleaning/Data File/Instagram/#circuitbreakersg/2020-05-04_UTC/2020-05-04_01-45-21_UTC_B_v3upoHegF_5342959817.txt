Chive Pancakes:
Flour, egg, salt, water and chives. Mix everything into a light batter, not too runny and enough to coat the chives. Spread the mixture thinly onto a heated pan to get a crisper texture. Serve with a dipping sauce of vinegar, sugar and soy sauce. Adjust the taste to your preference.
Good as a snack or as a light meal on its own
