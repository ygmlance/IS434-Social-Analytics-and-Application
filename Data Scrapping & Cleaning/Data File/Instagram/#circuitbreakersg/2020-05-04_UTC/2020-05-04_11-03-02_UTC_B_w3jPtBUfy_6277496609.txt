Airfried takoyaki makes for a very simple, fuss-free snacks. It’s not exactly the same as the Osaka street snacks but it’s kinda similar in terms of the the chewy internal texture. What I did: add 1 cup of boiling water to 1 cup of flour and 1 tablespoon sugar. Mix well. Then I added a cup of finely chopped veggies (cabbage, chilli, parsley) and finely chopped chicken sausage (should add sotong for a real “tako” but no time to defrost so modified version). Scoop with an ice cream scoop and pop in the airfryer at 180deg c for 20 mins. At halftime turn it around a bit to make sure all sides are cooked well. Oh I also used the baking pan that comes with the airfryer and put a tablespoon of butter in it (which melts in the heat and cooks the  takoyaki nicely .
