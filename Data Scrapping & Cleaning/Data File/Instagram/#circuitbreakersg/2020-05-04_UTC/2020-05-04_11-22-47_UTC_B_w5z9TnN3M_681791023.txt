Day 28 CB Dinner - Protect our earth 🌏 by cutting food waste in our fridge; whatever bits & pieces left to make our dinner tonight. It’s the last day of the 4th CB week, I shall end my journey of documenting CB meals in my humble home 😃 We all managed to pull through 4 weeks.. another 4 weeks we can do it! #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomechallenge #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #covid_19😷
