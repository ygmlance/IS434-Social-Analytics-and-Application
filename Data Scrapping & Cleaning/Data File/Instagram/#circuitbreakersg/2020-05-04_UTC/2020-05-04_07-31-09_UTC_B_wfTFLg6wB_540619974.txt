Peranakan fare has a lot to do with eating together, but in light of the circuit breaker, perhaps mealtime experiences have changed. And we'd love to see how you're doing it. How do you arrange your food? Do you bring out special plates? Do you lay out the boxes in a certain way? Share your best #AtHomeWithCOMO moment with us and you could win a S$100 COMO Dempsey dining voucher! Here’s how:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1. Take a photo of your Candlenut meal.
2. Post on Instagram with the hashtag #AtHomeWithCOMO and tag @candlenutsg.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
One lucky winner will be announced at the end of every week. All the best, and we're looking forward to all your foodie moments.
