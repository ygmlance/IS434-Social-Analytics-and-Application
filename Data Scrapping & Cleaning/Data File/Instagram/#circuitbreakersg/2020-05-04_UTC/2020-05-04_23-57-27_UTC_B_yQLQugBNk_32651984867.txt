3 Ways your neck and Décolleté Reveal Your Age?
Crepey Skin and Loss of Firmness
Irregular Skin Pigmentation
Skin Sensitivity and Scarring

The skin on the neck and décolleté is one of the most neglected areas on the body—and one of the areas that can reveal your true age.

Like many, you likely follow a daily routine to take care of the skin on your face. However, most people forget to protect and treat the skin on their neck and décolleté by covering it with clothes, cosmetics products, or a daily sunscreen. Similar to the face, sun exposure also ages the neck and décolleté. Failing to protect and treat this skin can cause premature aging to occur.
