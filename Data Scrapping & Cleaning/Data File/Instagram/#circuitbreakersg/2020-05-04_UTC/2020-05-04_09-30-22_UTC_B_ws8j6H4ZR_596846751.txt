Internship experience 
This is an unusual routine when the Circuit Breaker just started on 7 April. Most of the days I'm working from home instead of at the farm. This means that I do not get to interact with customers as often as I would like. However, I do get more free time in the morning!
With more people staying at home, there is lesser traffic coming into the farm. Nowadays, only a few of our loyal customers will come by to pick up produce every other hour. The customers that do come by leave promptly whilst observing the strict rules we have placed for social distancing. As a frontline worker in this tense period, I'm spirited by the cooperation and mutual support that our customers are giving!
I hope everyone else is coping well and taking the Circuit Breaker seriously! 4 more weeks to go!
