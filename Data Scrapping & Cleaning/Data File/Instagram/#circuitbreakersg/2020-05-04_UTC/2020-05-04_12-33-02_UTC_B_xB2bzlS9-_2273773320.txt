| CB ~ Day 28 | korean #friedchicken 
Been craving for Korean Chimaek for a while now, so here's our kitchen experiment no. 3.
.
Of (A) #homemade Korean Fried Chicken and (B) #homemade Spicy & Sticky Korean Fried Chicken (KFC), with Hite 🍺 to accompany.
.
First, we marinated the KFC fillet our way, with minced garlic, fish sauce, oyster sauce, balsamic vinegar, L&P and hot paprika for an hour.
.
Then we dredged the first lot in potato starch, egg-wash and Baker&Cook bread-crumbs before deep-frying (the smooth & darker ones in the pix).
.
The mechanics for lot no. 2 was similar to the above, except that we used crushed Potato Chips instead of bread-crumbs (the lighter-looking, textured ones).
.
Served with pickled daikon, honey mustard and hot sauce, and an optional squeeze of lime.
.
For the 'Yang Nyeom' or Spicy & Sticky Korean Fried Chicken, we tossed the fried chix in a mixture of Gochujang sauce, tomato sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, fish sauce, minced garlic, sesame oil and honey before sprinkling on sesame seed.
. 
Korean Chimaek kitchen experiment no. 3 accomplished. 'Mashisoyo!'.
