This bowl of Pulut Hitam (black glutinous rice dessert) brought back childhood nostalgia. It has been one of my favourite dessert since young - my other favourite would be Bubur Terigu. Mum makes a mean version of the dessert and is a favourite among family and friends. Store-bought version has never been able to won me over.
