[GIVEAWAY] Turned our house into an indoor gym yesterday and quite liked the space, privacy & not having to wait for someone to finish their set. Also liked that i had the hubsters around to photograph me in my new gym outfit instead of struggling to take #gymselfies in some quiet corner & feeling like a weirdo. 🤣 Introducing the “straining to look at my own bum” pose, followed by the “flamingo” and “yes, shiny red ball, i see you”. 🤣🤣🤣 Also super excited to share the love with you... enjoy 20% off each purchase when you shop at @gymwearmovement with the PROMO CODE: Cheryl20 ONLY for the month of May!

PS: If you like what I’m wearing, the top is called “peekaboo” and the bottoms are “camo 7/8 tights”. Super comfy & absorbs sweat great too 💦! .
