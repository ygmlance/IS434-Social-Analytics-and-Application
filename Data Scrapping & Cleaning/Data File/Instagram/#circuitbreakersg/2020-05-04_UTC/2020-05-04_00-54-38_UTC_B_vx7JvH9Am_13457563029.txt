There was a day I wanted to be undisturbed in the kitchen when my little girl decided she would pound the egg shells we have saved for our plant compost.
.
“Mama, l’m also so busy preparing food... for my baby plant.”
.
I have to say, she surprised me - I didn’t realize she could play this way while I got busy!
.
Since then, I’ve used this set of mortar and pestle to occupy her whenever I needed uninterrupted space in the kitchen.
.
These are ways we have infused sensory fun using the motar and pestle, to smash and grind:
🌿 garlic for dips
🌿 egg shells for compost
🌿 herbs for cooking
🌿 lemongrass for drinks
🌿 nuts for salads (you can put them on ice cream too!)
.
The possibilities are endless and the products so practical - this also allows my enthusiastic little helper to be an active contributor at home!
.
Shown here is 👧🏻 feeding her “baby” with our egg shell compost. She called herself “mommy plant” 😂.
.
If you want to infuse practicality to sensory play/ motor skill development, then you may want to get a set too.
.
👶🏻 tried to play with it but he hasn’t developed enough hand strength - still, no harm exposing him to this fun “toy”!

🌿I bought this set from @fairpricesg xtra (at only $4.90!) and I really recommend it. If you are planning to get one, choose a set that is not too heavy for your child (for good grip) and has relatively more depth (as opposed to play sets) so that the ingredients do not fall out easily.
