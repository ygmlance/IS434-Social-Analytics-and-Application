To the world, you are a mother but to your family, you are the world ❤️

Being a mum means being my kids' everything, their world, their heroine, their strength and their pillar of support. Thanks to my mum who loves me unconditionally and always be my best supporter, my best friend, my best teacher and my warmest home, my mum is more than just a mum to me, she’s my world and thanks to her, I’m the world in my kids’ eyes.
