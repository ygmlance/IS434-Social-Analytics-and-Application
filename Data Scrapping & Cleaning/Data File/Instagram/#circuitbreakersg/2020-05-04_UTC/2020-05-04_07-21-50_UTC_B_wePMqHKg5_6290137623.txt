Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, Hand Sanitisers have been pretty much a staple in all our lives - almost everyone has a bottle in their bags, and in their homes or workplaces. Can you just imagine the number of single-use plastic bottles being thrown away everyday? 😱 To encourage more people to buy in bulk to save packaging waste, we’ll be reducing the prices of our food-grade Hand Sanitiser refills to make it more accessible to everyone! 🙌🏼
.
Developed by our friends at @thesimplygood (from the team at UglyGood), a local social enterprise set up to shine the spotlight on plastic waste, their skin-friendly (pH7) Hand Sanitiser kills 99.99% of bacteria and viruses with a simple formula: 70% food-grade ethyl alcohol, deionised water and isopropyl alcohol - that’s it! No sulphates, chlorine, EDTA, parabens or other nasty chemicals you find in conventional sanitisers, but just as effective. This product works great as a disinfectant spray as well! 😉
.
While alcohol is a necessary active ingredient to killing most types of germs, bacteria and viruses, the folks at SimplyGood have made a conscious decision to invest only in premium food-grade ethyl alcohol (or FCC ethanol...very different from regular ethanol) for this product, making it safer for use on food contact surfaces (i.e. utensils, dining areas) and for sanitising hands before handling food! 🌿
.
The SimplyGood Hand Sanitiser will be available as a refill via our online shop! In line with our efforts to reduce packaging waste, we’ll be repurposing the empty drink bottles and milk cartons from our cafe to send the refills to you. Please rest assured that the bottles will be washed and cleaned thoroughly before use. 💦

Also, remember that hand sanitisers are a great alternative when you have no access to soap and water, but whenever possible, maintaining good personal hygiene and washing your hands frequently is still your best bet! Stay safe and healthy everyone! 💚
