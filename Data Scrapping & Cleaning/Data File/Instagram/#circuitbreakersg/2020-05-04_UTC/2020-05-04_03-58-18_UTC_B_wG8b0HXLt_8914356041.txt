🦐 SPICY SHRIMP RAMEN
- add soup pack and 500ml water in a saucepan
- bring to simmer then add in shrimp and cook for a minute or more until cooked then remove and set aside
- next add in noodles stirring on and off and  cook for about 4 minutes
- you can pop in some greens like bok choy our broccoli during the last 30 seconds
- assemble and serve immediately

📝 VERDICT
Personally I prefer Tonkotsu flavor because the shrimp taste is too strong for my liking
