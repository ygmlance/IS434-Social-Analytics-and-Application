🕖Dinner:
-Bak Kut Teh
-Stir-fry Long beans and diced carrots with X.O sauce
-Baked Enoki Mushroom with garlic and scallion.

The cooling weather on this gloomy evening makes my husband crave for a bowl of classic comforting garlicky peppery pork rib herbal soup, aka Bak Kut Teh.
Added an extra handful of garlic cloves and pig stomach, simmered in low heat.

let’s Jiak !
