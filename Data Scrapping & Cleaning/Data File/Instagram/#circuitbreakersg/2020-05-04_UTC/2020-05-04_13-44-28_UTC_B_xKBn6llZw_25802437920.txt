; {Circuit Breaker Day 28}

May the four be with you.

Super excited (to the point of immediately video calling the bf) to have my kalimbas completed! Been working on painting them for a couple of days.

Thankew so much to @kalimbahub for the crazy fast and efficient customer service!

On the back of each kalimba, I wrote in pencil first and then painted over the beautiful pre-chorus and chorus of ‘Highlands (Song of Ascent)’ by Hillsong.

Considering everything that I’ve been through in life, this song always gets me emotional tbh. This lovely beautifully written song was introduced to me by my bf, when his church band was rehearsing this song earlier this year.

I always feel like I can’t draw. I love drawing but I’m crap at it. So for the one with the pre-chorus talking about God’s grace, I painted my doodles with a black background. The doodling style has been part of me since my poly days.

As for the blank kalimba, it had the chorus and that’s it. I tried to think what to paint in front, but I realised the essence of the beautiful chorus was enough. Also helps that I suck at painting/drawing hahaha.

Can’t wait to try this instrument!
