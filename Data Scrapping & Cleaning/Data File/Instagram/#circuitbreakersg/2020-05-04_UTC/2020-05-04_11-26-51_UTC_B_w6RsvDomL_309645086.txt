We have good news to share ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚, starting May 12th we are back in business. 
With all the social distancing and safety measures in place keeping in mind the current crisis situation, we will be able to bake & cake and be a part of your celebrations as well as entertain your sweet cravings. 
As most of you are aware , the new normal is super long queues outside the supply stores , as well as "if you are lucky you will get it" mode for online orders. Hence kindly give us some lead time so that we are able to provide you our best service, short notice will be very hard to pull through. 
Absolutely excited to get back to work next week and hoping things improve on all frontiers very soon. 
Now to this cake story. A big milestone celebration that had to be downsized to just family only cake cutting . So we did our best to customize this 4" chocolate mudcake and make it memorable. A edible image banner in front, lots of berries and ferroros decorated this chocolate mudcake filled and frosted with dark chocolate ganache. We couldn't source a miniature gin bottle in time so yours truly did it on fondant. Loved how this cake turned out.
