Mustard green rice 芥菜饭 or Dua cai png (in Hokkien), a traditional rice dish that usually contains mustard green (duh), pork belly, Chinese mushrooms and dried shrimp. 🍛 .

Another childhood dish of mine. 😀

It is an easy one pot dish - stir fry all ingredients in a wok, add in the rice to mix, and then transfer to a rice cooker and cook according to the instructions of your rice cooker. ✌🏼 I added minced garlic, minced shallots and minced ginger in the stir fry as well and it was really yummy! 😋 .

It’s not easy to find mustard greens from the supermarket these days so I used preserved mustard greens which I picked up recently and frozen pork belly in my freezer. I generally don’t like using preserved or frozen food but in times like this, I’m actually grateful that I could whip up a childhood dish with the ingredients I have. #gratitudediary
