May the force be with you, because May the 4th ain't the end of Circuit Breaker but we will get through this. Who would have thought a triple scoops of ice cream would be such a joy, especially during a time like this. 
Btw, with each extra scoop you add, the extra scoop gets ridiculously cheaper. If only there's such a thing in SG.
