Good Friday. 
Covid-19 Circuit Breaker - Day 4.
If you want to exercise, you can do so at nearby parks alone or with household members, but please practise safe distancing. 
If stay down south, go to south.... if stay in the west, dont take public transport until the east to exercise! 😅
Stay safe, stay healthy! 🙏🏻🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️🐩😇
