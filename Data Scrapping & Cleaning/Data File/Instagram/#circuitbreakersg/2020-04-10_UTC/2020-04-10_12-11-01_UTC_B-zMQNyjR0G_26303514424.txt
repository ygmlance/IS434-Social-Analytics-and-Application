@thewoofagency Tyson was the last dog left in the pound to be bailed out in a recent re homing exercise. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä

Tyson was due to be put down but the lovely people from Exclusively Mongrels notified CAS that he was the last dog left in the pound and they put out an appeal for a foster home. Tyson's luck was shining and they managed to meet Sally and Kevin who very kindly opened their hearts and home to Tyson. Tyson did go off for a home stay after that but managed to run off as the family didn't close their gate. He was found after four tough days. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä

Thankfully, he has now found his forever home and has a little sister, Fudge. They love to explore hiking trails and go on adventures as a pawmily. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
