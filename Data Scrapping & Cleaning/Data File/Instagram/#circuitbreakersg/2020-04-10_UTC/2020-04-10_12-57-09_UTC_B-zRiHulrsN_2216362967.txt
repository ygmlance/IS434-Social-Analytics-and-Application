Butadon with chawanmushi â›©
.
Butadon:
Stir fry sliced onions for 1 minute, add in pork slices and stir fry till almost cooked. Pour in seasoning (3 tbsp mirin, 4tbsp soy sauce, 4 tbsp sugar, 6 tbsp cooking sake), simmer and reduce the sauce to your preference.

Chawanmushi needs further experimenting as I've substituted too many ingredients for this recipe. ðŸ¤­
