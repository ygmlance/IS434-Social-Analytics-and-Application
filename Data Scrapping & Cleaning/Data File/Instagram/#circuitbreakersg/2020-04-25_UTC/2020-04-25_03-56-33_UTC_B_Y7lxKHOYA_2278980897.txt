A number of stewards and stewardesses have joined the ranks of SMRT station staff as new Transport Ambassadors.

SIA cabin crew have also been working at local hospitals like Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, as Care Ambassadors.

Grounded SIA staff have also been helping out at the National Call Centre to address public queries on the collection of masks
