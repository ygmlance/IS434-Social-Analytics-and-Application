#AtasQueen @gaincitysg As part of Sing Together Singapore!
. 
Gain City pays tribute to our frontline health and migrant workers as they brave and battle the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.
. 
Staff of Gain City together with thousands of people joined a singalong belting out Singaporean most well-loved tune Home.
. 
Staff waved torchlights at their windows and balconies with cheering and applause.
Our homes, our skies and our hearts were lit tonight ðŸŽ†.
. 
As a home-grown brand we are glad to be part of this moment. Thank you Singapore
On behalf of everyone at Gain City, weâ€™d like to say a big thank you to all frontline healthcare workers and migrant workers. Our hearts and prayers are with you!
