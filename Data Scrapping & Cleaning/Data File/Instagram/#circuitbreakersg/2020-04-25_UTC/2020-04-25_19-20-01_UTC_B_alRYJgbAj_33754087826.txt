Leftovers stir fry

With the same dough used for the mee hoon kueh. I decided to make some thick noodles with that.

Swept up the fridge with other leftover ingredients and cooked up a hearty meal.

There is a certain kind of beauty and satisfaction using leftovers to create something delicious ðŸ˜‹. What are your thoughts on using leftovers in cooking ?
