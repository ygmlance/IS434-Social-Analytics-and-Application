Didn't manage to gather much craft or art supplies before #circuitbreaker started so I'm trying to make do with what I have. Here's a 5-min paper plate bunny mask with really close eye holes and a random piece of scrap paper which Ellie insisted on pasting. But she seems to like it so 🤷‍♀️ #yay #smallwins .
