🍌Banana Bread aka quarantine bread- the bread that everyone would have at least tried to bake once during their quarantine (Aint I right) I’m not complaining because I love banana bread so much!! Especially so with the addition of poppy seeds for texture and that added crunch⁣
⁣
My recipe was inspired by the ones I tried in Maui, Hawaii! Never forgot the taste ever since 💗💗⁣
⁣
Ingredients⁣
🍌1 3/4 cups cake flour⁣
🍌1.5 tsp baking powder⁣
🍌1.5 tsp baking soda⁣
🍌¼ tsp salt⁣
🍌3 large eggs⁣
🍌3/4 cup castor sugar⁣
🍌3/4 cup brown sugar⁣
🍌1 cup mashed ripe bananas About 3 medium⁣
🍌3/4 cup vegetable oil⁣
🍌1/2 tsp banana essence optional⁣
🍌1 tbsp Poppyseeds optional⁣
⁣
Instructions⁣
1)Preheat oven to 175 deg celcius 2)Whisk baking powder, baking soda, salt and cake flour in a bowl. Set aside 3)Add mashed bananas, oil, brown sugar, castor sugar, banana essence and eggs into another bowl and beat until light and fluffy. I beat for approx. 1-2 mins. 4)Mix flour mixture into egg mixture and whisk until smooth. Do not over mix. 5)Fold in poppyseeds 6)Bake for 30-40mins until toothpick inserted comes out clean. At the 20 min mark, if top of cake is browning too fast, cover the top of the cake with aluminium foil or place a tray on the top rack to prevent the top of the cake from over browning⁣
