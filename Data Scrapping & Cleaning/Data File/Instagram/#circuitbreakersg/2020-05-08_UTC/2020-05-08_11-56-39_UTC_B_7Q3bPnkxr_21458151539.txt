Husband taste test PASS! It is really the closest we can get to Klang style BKT. Soup pack from Tean's Gourmet, meat of choice and cooking instructions are on the pack. We added an extra step to 'clean' meat with low grade shaoxing and coarse salt rub and get rid of any unpleasant meat odour. Do you know Indonesian pork is always the preferred pork? Australian, Msian and Brazilian pork always has an odour. So the rest of the step follow package instructions and before serving add additional ingredients of choice like taukee, enoki, meatballs etc.
