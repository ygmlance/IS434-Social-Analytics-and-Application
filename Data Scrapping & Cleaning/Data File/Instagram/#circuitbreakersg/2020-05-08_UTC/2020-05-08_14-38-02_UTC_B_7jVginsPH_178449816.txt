This here is Banana Chocolate cake made with Nutella. I used the same recipe that I shared a few photos earlier, except I substituted the chocolate chips (since it’s sold out) for Nutella and I added extra eggs. It is a bit more spongy than the earlier cake which is more pound cake like. This tastes good too and I love the sponginess of it.
.
Tip when substituting Nutella in your bakes: Because Nutella contains a lot of palm oil, it sort of shrinks a little. So put more Nutella than what the recipe calls for for chocolate. And only do this for hardy cakes eg banana cake where no matter what you do the cake will be decent.
.
Oh and coat the banana slices w sugar. I forgot so mine don’t look caramelised.
