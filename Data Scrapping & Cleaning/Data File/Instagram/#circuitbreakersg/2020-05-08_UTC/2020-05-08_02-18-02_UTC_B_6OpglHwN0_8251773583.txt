For the next few weeks, we are inviting some folks to share what they have been creating at home during this period. Kicking off this series is Jill (@jillposta )!

After learning to spin on a drop spindle, I took a 2-hour private lesson with Craft Atelier. I bought some raw wool and rented a spinning wheel home to practice. All this happened just before #circuitbreakersg kicked into place. The circuit breaker month have extended to two and since then, I have dyed some of that raw wool using the techniques I picked up from @parkourkitties Self-Striping Sock workshop (also hosted by Craft Atelier). The video shows me drafting and spinning the first 50grams. Swipe left to see work-in-progress and the final product. Spinning is addictive! Thanks, Craft Atelier!
