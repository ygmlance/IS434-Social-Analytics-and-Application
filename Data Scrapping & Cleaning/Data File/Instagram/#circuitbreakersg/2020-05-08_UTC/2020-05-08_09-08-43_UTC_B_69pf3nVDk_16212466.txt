Made a wonderful lunch with some ingredients which I bought from Singapore Home Cooks group buy. 👍🏻👍🏻 I simply did a Fried Rice with garlic, canned crab meat, eggs and seasoned with a little premium fish sauce. Tobiko (Flying Fish Roe) and chopped spring onion will be last to be introduced to the rice because you don't really want to cook them. 
Heat up cooked Unagi and savour with fried rice. Add more Tobiko for more satisfaction. Yummm Shiok!! 😋😋😋
