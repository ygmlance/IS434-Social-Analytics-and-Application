This quotes is from Mr Hoon Thing Leong CEO of Kim San Leng F&B that I saw in KSL website http://www.kimsanleng.org/ which I find a great saying. 
The founder of Kim San Leng is Mr Hoon Moh Heng -father of Mr Hoon Thing Leong. The less educated but hardworking man start from zero to a coffee shop owner -owning 30 more coffee shop. Mr Hoon Thing Leong who always helped out his father in the coffee shop since he was a child, follow in his father footsteps and took over the business. 
3 years ago, KSL had launched the online delivery- Dabao Now! which now had turned out to support the business during this circuit breaker due to covid19.

Sometimes we tend to be too commit to our plan but the abilty to make changes might help us in future.
