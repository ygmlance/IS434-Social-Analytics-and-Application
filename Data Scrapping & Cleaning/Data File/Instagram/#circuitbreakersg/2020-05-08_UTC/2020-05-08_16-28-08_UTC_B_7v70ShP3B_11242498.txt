We become rich when we exert all our efforts to acquire the most valuable asset, the need towards our Creator, Allah. By wanting Allah is by wanting to be pleasurable to Him; by knowing that being able to serve Him in any kind of acts is so worthy that we find our heart is full of contentment only by longing to be at His service. Let us strive more on seeking forgiveness from Him in this second half of Ramadhan. O Allah, grant us the rizq to serve You on Lailatulqadr!
