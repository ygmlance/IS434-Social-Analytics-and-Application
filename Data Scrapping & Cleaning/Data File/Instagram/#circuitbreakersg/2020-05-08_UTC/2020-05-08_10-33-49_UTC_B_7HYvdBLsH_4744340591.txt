Big big thank you to @yuzureads for lending me Starless Sea! She lent it to me before the lockdown and extended lockdown begin in Sg and as I read it I realized Morgenstern has a flowy dreamy style of writing for some chapters (which I really liked in the past and tried hard to emulate)~ the book feels metafictive to me â€” writing about reading and writing â€” and I still havenâ€™t gotten past half of it because, well, other books and distractions. ====
The Boy Who Steals Houses is simply amazing it made me cry really hard towards the end, Drew captures loneliness and the desire for familial warmth in a beautiful, relatable and heartbreaking way. ===
What have you guys been doing lately and what have you been reading? Do share with me so I can look it up as I continue to rot away in the lockdown! ðŸ˜…
