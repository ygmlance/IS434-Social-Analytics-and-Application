Experimenting on some Crumble Brownies, S’mores Brownies and homemade Speculoos Brownie 🍯 wooo.

The homemade speculoos butter didn’t quite work out in the brownie.. 😪 so.. we’re still out of speculoos flavour for now :( S’mores & Crumble Brownies still needs a little more experiment but it’s nearly there.. 🤭hee. Lemme know if you guys will be interested in them!

On the other hand 🤚🏼 , we’re 4 days away before we get to resume business and I’m really excited to start again 🥳 We have start taking in orders, so DM us to order 😊
