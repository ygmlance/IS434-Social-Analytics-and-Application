This is what happens when you don’t go out and stuck at home and have a sweet tooth like me 🤦‍♀️bake bake and bake then eat eat and eat 🤷‍♀️here is my latest try. German Christmas Cookies. The recipe has cardamom but I baked them without as I didn’t have it at home. Still they were so yummy! I wonder if cardamom is must or you bake without it? Oh and I didn’t have time to make them crescent shape as it was a family movie time and I didn’t wanna miss the movie 🎥 #family time #vanillekipferl
