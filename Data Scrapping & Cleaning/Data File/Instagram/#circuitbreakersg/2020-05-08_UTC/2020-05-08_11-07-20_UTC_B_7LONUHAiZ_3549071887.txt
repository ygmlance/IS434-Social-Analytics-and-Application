CB Day 32

Roast chicken with rosti potatoes, fruit salad and sauteÃÅed brown mushroom. Chicken was so flavorful despite only marinated half a day. My first attempt of rosti is a successful too. Super yummy. Think my cooking skills having improved during circuit breaker.

Salt n Pepper
Ground garlic
Ground onion 
Ground ginger
Dried Rosemary 
Dried oregano
Olive oil to drizzle 
Butter slices

Rosti potatoes
Boil potato till soft. Shred. Season with salt, pepper and rosemary. Fry shredded potato in olive oil and butter till crispy. .
