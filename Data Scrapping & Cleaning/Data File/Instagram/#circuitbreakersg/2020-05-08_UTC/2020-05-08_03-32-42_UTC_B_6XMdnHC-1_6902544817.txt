Somehow Soto Ayam reminds me of my trips to Amsterdam. One might think the soto ayams served there are mediocre however due to the large colonial presence the Dutch had in Indonesia it resulted in many Indonesians migration to Netherlands.The indonesian fares there can be as authentic as the ones you can find in Indonesia
