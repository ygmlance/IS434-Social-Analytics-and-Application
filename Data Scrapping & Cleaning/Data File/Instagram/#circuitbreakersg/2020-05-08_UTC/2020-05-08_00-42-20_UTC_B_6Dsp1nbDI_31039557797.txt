â–  Hey guys! Here's a Lunge Matrix for you today!
This Lunge Matrix will work on your Single Leg Movements, whilst hitting your Core Musculature & Stability, as you maintain balance and control throughout the movement. If you are using a load, it would give those shoulders a good burn too :)
Check out the demo. Try it and let me know how it goes! And as usual, dont forget your warm up and cool down. â–  Lunge Matrix
â€¢ 3~6 Rep / Side, 60~90s Rest, 4~6 Rounds
â€¢ ONE Rep Matrix = Overhead Squat > F. Lunge > Trunk Twist (both ways) > R. Lunge > High Knee Press
*Ensure all moves are controlled, & dont forget to breath as you move
.
â–  How?
- Perform 3~5 Reps / Side
- Rest 60~90s, complete 4~6 Rounds
- My advice is to try out the Lunge Matrix with bodyweight first, then adjust the load to ability
- I am using a medicine ball here, but you may use any other implement (i.e. dumbbell, kettlebell, weight plate, bag of rice, water bottles, flower pot ðŸ˜†...)
