May 2020 - Working from home with Daddy @alexwong3261.
.
Between the two of us, we do at least 1-2 online calls daily. It's exhausting behind the scenes as Ada could be well-behaved here, or throwing a tantrum. While colleagues are happy to see her, I am struggling to be attentive and give my fullest attention. As a result, I have to take more calls at night, or correspond again the next day. It's an awful cycle, but we managed to our best.
.
This period of #circuitbreakersg has allowed me to learn more about raising and teaching a child. I've clearly taken things for granted because I assume she learns a lot more in school, and no need much more at home.
.
Turns out, I'm pretty bad at putting her down for day naps. So I'm carrying her for up to 2 hours straight twice a day! Bonding - yes. Tiring - also yes. ðŸ˜…
.
Though I'm tired all the time, seeing Ada eyes light up when I read to her, or carry her, or tickle her, makes me feel so happy - oxytoxin! Rough days are rough, but no offence taken despite the number of times I get poked in the eye and hit on the head with books.
.
By the way, Ada's beginning to walk unassisted! Really very proud to see this milestone. Guess CB isn't so bad afterall...
