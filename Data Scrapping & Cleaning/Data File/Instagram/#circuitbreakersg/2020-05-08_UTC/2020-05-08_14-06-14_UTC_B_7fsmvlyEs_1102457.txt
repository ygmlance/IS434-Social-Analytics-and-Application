#CircuitBreakerSg Day 32! One pot collagen fish soup for dinner! The rich tasting milky fish bone soup was made from scratch, just seasoned with fried sole fish powder and shaoxing wine. Loaded up with thick sliced fish, minced pork, egg dumplings, prawns, oysters and lobster balls to make a bowl of hearty fish soup. So good and comforting! ðŸ˜‹
