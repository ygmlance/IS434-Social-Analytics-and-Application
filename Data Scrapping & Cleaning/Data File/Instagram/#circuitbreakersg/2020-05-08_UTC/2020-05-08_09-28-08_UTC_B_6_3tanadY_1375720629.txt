Cinnamon Buns 🍞 肉桂面包卷

Haven’t make bread in, probably 5-6 years, after being traumatised by too many failures in the past, and shifted my focus to cakes.

Thanks to @purpleccloud guidance and advice, I managed to get these soft and fluffy babies the first time! Still some improvements to work on but at least I’ve regained some confidence. Try again! ❤️

以前做面包失败太多次，就专心做蛋糕，大概有5-6年没做面包了。这次有朋友的帮忙和提点，让我第一次做就做出又软又松的面包！当然还有些地方需要改进，但至少找回了我做面包的信心了！继续加油！💪🏻😁
