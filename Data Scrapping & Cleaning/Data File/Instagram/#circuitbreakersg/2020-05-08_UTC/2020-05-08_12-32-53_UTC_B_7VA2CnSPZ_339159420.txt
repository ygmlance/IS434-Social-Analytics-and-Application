#Circuitbreakersg Day 32
.
Every pizza is a personal pizza if you add your favourite toppings
.
This quick & easy pizza is easy to make and kids can get involved too
.
Start with a @missionfoods.sg wholegrain wrap as a base. I like to use wraps since they are thin and thin-crust pizzas are my preferred choice
.
Spread some red pesto sauce and simply add your own toppings. For this, I added spicy sausage slices, tomatoes and kale, topped with some mozzarella cheese and oregano & basil spices
.
Pop it into the oven (toaster) for about 10 minutes and you've got your own homemade pizza!
.
What sort of toppings do you like on your pizza? . .
