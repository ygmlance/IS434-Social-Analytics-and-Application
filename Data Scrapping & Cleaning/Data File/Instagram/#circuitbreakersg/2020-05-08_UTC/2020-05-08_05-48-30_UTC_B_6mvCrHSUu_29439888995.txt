How are you doing? Staying home these days makes us more aware of our core calling: designing to connect. As humans, we all need connections, and at work, research has shown that productivity can be traced to ideas raised in both formal and informal conversation. 
We may be working in isolation these days, but don’t forget to reach out to your workmates for a chat, even outside of your formal online meetings. We’re here as well: come talk workplace design with us, or just to say hi!
