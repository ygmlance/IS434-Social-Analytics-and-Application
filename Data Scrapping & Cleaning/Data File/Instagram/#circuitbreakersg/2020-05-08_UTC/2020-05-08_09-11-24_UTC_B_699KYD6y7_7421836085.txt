Its Day 2 of "The difference between getting your Bazi analysed and not getting it done".
In this example, Both Person A and B have a potential health issue. 
Person B lived every day with the same routine and was unfortunately diagnosed with a critical health issue. 
As for Person A who went on a Bazi Consultation and identified that potential health issue. He changes his routine to work on correcting the potential problem. Fortunately, the problem is not critical, and with the help of medication, Person A won the battle.

Do you want to do like Person A and work on those potential health issues?
