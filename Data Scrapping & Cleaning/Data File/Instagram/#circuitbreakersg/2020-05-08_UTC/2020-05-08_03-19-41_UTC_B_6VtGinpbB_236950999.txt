Homemade Muah Chee [ Glutinous Rice Ball ] .

Slightly chewy n soft texture coated with black sesame n ground peanut. Simply addictive .

Making Muah Chee is so fun! Great way for family bonding... one cut, one coat n another one did the plating ðŸ¤© Iâ€™m so glad that during this circuit breaker, we spend more quality time together #imblessed .
