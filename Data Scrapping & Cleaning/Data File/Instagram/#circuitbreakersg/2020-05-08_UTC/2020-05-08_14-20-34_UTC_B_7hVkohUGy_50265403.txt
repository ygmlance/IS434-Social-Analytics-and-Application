Edible gold at reasonable prices, just in time for Raya ✨

I’m looking forward to Raya bakes coming up once business resumes on May 12th!

But I cannot imagine the queues you’d have to go through to get your supplies. Having to lug it all the home is another problem altogether 💆🏻‍♀️ Thankfully there are plenty of options now available on the website @classicdelisg! 
Get your supplies such as nuts, pasteurized egg whites / yolks, chocolate, butter and whipping cream delivered to your doorstep.

Have fun shopping with my discount code ‘10SARAH’ for 10% off all your purchases this month 😉
