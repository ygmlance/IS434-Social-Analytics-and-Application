My first holey Artisan loaf 😍😍😍.... took almost 6 hours to work on this. Now I understand why this bread, which has only 3 very cheap ingredients flour water and yeast cost $5 per loaf. Never had been able to set aside 5,6 hours watching over this baby at home on a normal day so all thanks to coVid-19. The finished product is simply satisfying 😘. Can’t wait for breakfast tmw, best match with slices of cut butter-cold!
