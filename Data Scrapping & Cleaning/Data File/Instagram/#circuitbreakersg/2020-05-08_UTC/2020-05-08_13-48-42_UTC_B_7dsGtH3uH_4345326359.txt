The New Normal.
I am grateful that I am still able to connect with my fam and besties during this period, through technology. My old folks at home are getting the hang of video-calling and somehow they seem to be loving it. Of course they still miss the weekly gatherings.
We might be miles away but i guess when there's a will, there's a way, we can still connect with one another. All we need to do is to enjoy such moment and have fun video-calling during this CB.
