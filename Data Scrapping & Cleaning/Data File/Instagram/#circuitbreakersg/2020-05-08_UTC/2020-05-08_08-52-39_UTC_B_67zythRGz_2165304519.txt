CB day 32
1st attempt making bread and so happy it’s a SUCESS !!!
It’s sure a long process. Had to make the #TangZhong last night and let it cool overnight. I hate getting my hands dirty when make food but kneading and rolling the dough seems very therapeutical. Have so much fun making this so Soft and Fluffy bread. .
