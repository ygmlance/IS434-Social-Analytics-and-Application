As we wind down another week of WFH, from #selfquarantine, it’s useful to process our thoughts and emotions. This is likely going to be a marathon, not a sprint. If we wish to sustain ourselves, we need to do things in a sustainable manner. And often, DOING things differently starts from LOOKING at things differently.  Look out at the wider perspective while taking a few unhurried breaths. Things might start to look different for you in the coming week.
