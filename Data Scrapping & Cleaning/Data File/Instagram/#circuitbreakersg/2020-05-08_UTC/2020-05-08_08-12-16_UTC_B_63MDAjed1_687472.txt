Selfie Friday 😛 it’s been awhile that I will post the photo without any IG filter or make up - okay a bit of lipstick cos I got for free to day 😜  @meamayketnipha 😘 thx u ka. .
Since we been introduced to IG culture, the filters become our essential thing and when I scroll down to see old pics - I cannot find my actual looks and nature skins self. • So today posting to embrace my stay home period that seem to rarely kiss the sun 😅 and I don’t complain that 😊☺️ #nofilter #bareskin #myskincolor #innerself #embraceyourself #selfisolation #stayhome #circuitbreakersg
