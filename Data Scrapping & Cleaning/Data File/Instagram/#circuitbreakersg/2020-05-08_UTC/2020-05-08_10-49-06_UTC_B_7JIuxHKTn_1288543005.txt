Tonight's dinner is Hokkien Mee - a Southeast Asian dish.
.
It consists of egg noodles, rice noodles stir-fried with egg, prawns and squid, and serve with bak choy.
.
I used instant #AsiaJoy Hokkien Prawn Noodle Paste for the sauce.
.
Candice loves it totally and finished up her dinner in 5 mins. #recordbreaking time. She asked me to cook again another day. No need to buy from outside next time. üòÅ
