Circuit Breaker Day 32 - Haven't been using my eyeliner & wearing my work dresses for more than a month since circuit breaker. A good "break" from these but I'm wanting so much to get back to my usual work schedules...because I love what I've been doing! Never my habit of posting "goodnight" message but tonight I just feel like doing it...I'm feeling way too bored with working from home! Please do not get me wrong ~ I've all the while been a very independent woman in my personal life & career. I love doing things alone...but this COVID-19 situation is making me feeling too restrictive at work. I'm longing for this to be over soon. I tell myself - stay Positive, stay Patient, stay Adjustable & Adaptable to changes that I cannot control. GOODNIGHT World! I wanna wake up to a BETTER TOMORROW!
