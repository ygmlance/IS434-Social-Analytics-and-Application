Oh...my favourite hawker to get my fried Hokkien prawn noodle is from Chomp Chomp but it is always a minimum 45 mins wait. 😔⁣
⁣
Decided to try making my own to our own liking, a little drier type version. ⁣
⁣
I also skip the lard as I don’t have it.  But I guess that can also be made up with a good broth. ⁣
⁣
Overall, everyone at home loved it 😋⁣ Pretty happy with the results given it’s the first try. ⁣

Let’s feed our loved ones with the best! ❤️❤️❤️⁣
