Was craving for some garlic bread so I made some garlic bread spread! It's so simple it only requires 3 ingredients that you may already have on hand!
.
. 
Butter (softened at room temperature), garlic and English parsley.
.
. 
Mince and chop garlic and parsley, and mix them into the butter. And that's it! Spread the mixture onto some toast and place it into the toaster (until golden brown) or oven (200Â°C for ~10mins/until golden brown) and garlic bread is served!ðŸ˜‹ These babies smell heavenlyðŸ¤¤
