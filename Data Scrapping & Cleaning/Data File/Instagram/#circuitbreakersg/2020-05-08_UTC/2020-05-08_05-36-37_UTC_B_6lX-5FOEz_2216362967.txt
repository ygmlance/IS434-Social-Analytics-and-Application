Peri-Peri Chicken with Potatoes & Capsicums â€¢ all-in-one casserole
.
Preheat oven to 200dc. Place potato and capsicum chunks into casserole, sit Peri-peri marinated chicken on top (best if marinated overnight or at least a few hours & I like to give the meat a few jabs), cover with a foil, and pop into the oven for 45 mins.
Remove foil, broil for 10 mins to brown/caramelise the chicken (the skins especially!). Serve!
.
.
Note to self: Skins not caramelised enough. Increase broiling time to 15 mins or turn up the temp if time remains at 10 mins.
