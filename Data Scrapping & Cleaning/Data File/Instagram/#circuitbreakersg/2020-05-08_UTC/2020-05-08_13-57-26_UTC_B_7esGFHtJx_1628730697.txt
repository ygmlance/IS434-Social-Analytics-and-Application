Ken met the O-R3 today. Itâ€™s a security robot introduced by PUB and deployed at Pandan Reservoir to remind visitors to practice safe distancing.  It speaks in the 4 official languages. Was cute at the beginning but I can see how it will feel like a broken record pretty quickly. Not sure if itâ€™s capable of issuing summons on the spot for non compliance. Didnâ€™t hang around to test it ðŸ˜œ
