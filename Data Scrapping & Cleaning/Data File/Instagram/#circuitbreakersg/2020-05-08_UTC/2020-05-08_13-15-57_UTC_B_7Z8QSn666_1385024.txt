Anyone is starting to enjoy the #circuitbreaker now? ⁣

During the start of it, I was so sick with this circuit breaker thing as HBL/kids and my workload was driving me nuts. ⁣⁣

I think in between the last month, my feelings about all these kinda changed. Maybe because I stop trying so hard to make sure everything are in order. Maybe because I’m getting used to this #stayhome lifestyle. Maybe because business been poor and I’m less busy with work lately. I’m starting to really enjoy this Circuit Breaker. Mind you, now getting less sleep and kids still drive me nuts. But I’m am really appreciative of the ample time now to spend it with my husband and children. ⁣⁣

I may get pulled away by the little hands every 5 min when I’m in front of my laptop, but being present with them trumps missing them while working in my office.⁣⁣

In exchange of the late nights to finish my work now. I get hours more hugs, kisses and meaningful conversation with my little ones who are growing up faster than I can blink. All these, are priceless to me and I think I will miss it when it’s time we go back to work as per “normal” again.
