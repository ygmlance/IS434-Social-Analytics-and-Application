Roast Meat 🍖 for Early Mother’s Day dinner from @fook.kin tonight. Firstly I wanna say I’m sorry I too kanjiong take photo & eat I forgot to rearrange the dishes in the front row 😅, anyways their Chicken Rice - Rice 🍚 very Xiang (fragrant)!
-
Secondly I love the Fatty Char Siew best, while my hubs love the Roast Duck & “Sam Zam Bak”. The meat platter came with lotsa’ dipping sauce so we can savor each and everyone differently.
-
Thirdly, my girls whacked their Bak Chor Mee 🍜 super fast and almost cannot stop eating the Deep Fried Lotus Chips w Salted Egg Sauce but I had to stop them cuz’ all coughing. 😅

Loved the dinner tonight, not paid to share this post but I got abit of mood to do it in the name of Mother’s Day weekend. Hehe. I think they’re fully booked for this weekend but if you your order this weekend Fookkin will be gifting FREE MSW Mochis with orders. 😉
