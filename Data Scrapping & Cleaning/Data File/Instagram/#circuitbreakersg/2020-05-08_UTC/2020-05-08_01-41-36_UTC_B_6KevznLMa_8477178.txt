Not gonna take credits. This idea of creating a 🦋 from leaves does not come from me haha. It was 👦🏻’s HBL which 👧🏻 was more interested in completing haha. Again we went to that (one and only 😅) grass patch behind our home to pick up leaves for this project. 👧🏻 arranged the leaves to make up a butterfly, added in blue sky and i helped to draw a few flowers. I thought we did a pretty decent job...what do you think? Haha!
