Day 32 of #prettypaper and #circuitbreakersg! Also an update on our Eid collection: we will still be launching one this year (yay!) and you can place your orders, but we will only send them out after May 12. This means there is a high likelihood it will reach you in time for Eid if you are in Singapore and you place your orders early. As for international orders, we will still be accepting them, but do take note that your orders will definitely not reach you in time for Eid. Also, due to disruptions in international postage and delivery services, please expect some delays on the arrival of your items: it might take anything from 2-6 weeks later than the normal 8-10 working days for the USA, for example. So please take note of this before you place your order, ok? Above all, please be kind and patient with us small businesses, as we are all trying our best ❤️ thanks so much for your support! #lifeinthetimeofcorona #eid2020 #sampulraya
