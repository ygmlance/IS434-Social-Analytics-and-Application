#Circuitbreakersg day 32

CCB fatigue has taken over so everyone is edgy. Like EDGY.... ðŸ¥º

Being cooped up in the same house takes a little more than compromise. Itâ€™s about not taking anyone for granted & simply enjoying each otherâ€™s company. 
Taking the edge off with some delectable dessert made with whatever is available in the fridge once again. 
If you have plain flour, butter, eggs & milk, u can make too.

Dessert of the day : ðŸ”º Crepes with maple syrup, whipped cream (hand-whipped, very tired u know) , fruits, chocolate shavings & a sprinkle of icing sugar. ~
