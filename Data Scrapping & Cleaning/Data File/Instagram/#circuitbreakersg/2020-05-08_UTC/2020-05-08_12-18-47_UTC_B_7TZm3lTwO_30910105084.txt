Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 32:
Tested another technique of making korean braised ribs with the pressure cooker instead of cooking it over the stove. Quite happy with this method as it reduces the cooking time, although it still requires more than an hour to complete. Meat was almost falling off the bone - so tender!

Love how the king oyster mushrooms I added in absorbed all the wonderful flavour from the sauce. Delicious!
