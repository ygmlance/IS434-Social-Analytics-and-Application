15th Ramadan,Finding comfort in stillness. Guess we’re all still in the middle of Raya contemplations. Not sure what’s in store for us nearer to the day. No Ramadan bazaar has already left us quite a mark. To think of not having the family to get together on the day of syawal at your grandparent’s seeking forgiveness is another. Yet, all the propaganda showing you to buy new traditional wear.. Sampul Raya for the kids or bulk of fizzy drinks at wholesale prices lifted that mood in you. Mak-Mak will still be getting our fav. traditional kueh in lesser amount of bottles though (stakat buat makan sendiri, jadilah) and whippin up Raya dishes, pun stakat makan sendiri kat rumah. And today all we have is Tawakkul- reliance on his plan for us. Staying consistent to being resilient during this Ramadan and continue praying for light of hopes. #specialramadhan #circuitbreakersg
