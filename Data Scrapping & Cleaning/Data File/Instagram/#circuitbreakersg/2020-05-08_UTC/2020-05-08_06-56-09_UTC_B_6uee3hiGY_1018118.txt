It’s been a month plus since the start of our nation’s #circuitbreakersg and it definitely has changed our lives. For someone who enjoys a social gathering over food, I certainly miss hanging out with my friends and family over a delicious meal.
.
This Ramadan, @klooktravel_sg has partnered up with some of your favorite halal-certified food establishments to provide delivery, takeaways and meal-kits to make our iftar preparations even a lot easier. It’s still important that we observe social distancing measures while supporting our local F&B places, so head on over to @klooktravel_sg to see what’s available for you to order.

I certainly enjoyed this set of beef satay from Best Satay No. 7 & 8 from Lau Pa Sat! Oh I really do miss sitting down in front of the barbecue pit with smoke wafting through the air, but this satay goreng is enough to fulfill my cravings. The satay is available in beef, chicken or mutton and each kilogram of satay goreng comes with 500g of peanut sauce.
.
Pan fry it with a drizzle of olive oil, or stick it in the oven if you’re a little lazy (not judging cos it is Ramadan and fatigue can hit!), and serve it as a side to your family meal for iftar. Even better, order some for your family this Sunday to celebrate Mother’s’ Day! Who says you can’t have fun during this Circuit Breaker?
