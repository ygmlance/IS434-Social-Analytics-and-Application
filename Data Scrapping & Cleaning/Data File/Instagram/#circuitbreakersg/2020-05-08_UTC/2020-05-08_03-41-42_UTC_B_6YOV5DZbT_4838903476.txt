Meiji’s Hello Panda biscuits are some of the most classic and beloved Asian snacks, with a history stemming from 1979
The biscuits are made of shortbread and filled with a delightful cream spread. On the exterior of the biscuit, you might get one of a 100 different panda impressions doing random activities (though sadly, my most recent pack wasn’t printed very clearly)
Their real draw is their taste, though. I can’t decide whether my favorite is the strawberry or milk flavoured one
Recently, I also tried their new coconut flavour and their double chocolate flavour which I’d not tried before. The coconut one is delicious and reminds me rather of kueh bangkit. Meanwhile, I didn’t like the double chocolate much because I felt that the chocolate biscuit didn’t complement the chocolate cream well. The chocolate kick you would get from the normal vanilla biscuit and chocolate cream ones faded away
