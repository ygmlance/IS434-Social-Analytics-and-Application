used the paper roll we saved up to build a tower 
went on a car ride (is it all kids love to go petrol station? She loves to go to the convenience stall there)

went outdoor today! There’s so much to explore although it’s just our roof garden below. We found a snail and kept as pet then we saw 2 other different kinds of snail!
