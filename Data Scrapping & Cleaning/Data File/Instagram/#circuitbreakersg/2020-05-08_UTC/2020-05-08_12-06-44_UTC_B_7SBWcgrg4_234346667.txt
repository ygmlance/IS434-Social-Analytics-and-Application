【Recipe】Another day coming to an end. Am glad it’s finally weekend again. #circuitbreakersg day32 #sgunited

Nothing fancy for dinner but more of a comforting meal ☺️ Pretty much what I aim to serve up nowadays. 只要大家爱吃就好了 #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
Braised pork belly rice 卤肉饭，served with Bak choi and over chicken style steamed rice. 
Using the same pork belly recipe but I sliced it up for easier consumption.

A little more work compared to other dishes yes but it’s well worth the effort😉. Love that sticky collagen rich gravy and tender melt in your mouth pork belly...人间美食🤤

Have a restful night everyone. #要记得回家吃饭🐝
