Afternoon tea today, was 1/2 a bottle of Inedit Damm, a Belgian-style Witbier from Barcelona, Spain, and brewed with input from El Bulliâ€™s Ferran Adria. Mild sweetness, with bread yeast, orange peel and spice notes in the mid-palate. Quite light and still relatively fresh, despite being a 2017 bottling. Tasty and refreshing, perfect after a 10km mid-afternoon walk. ðŸ˜¬ #ineditdamm #witbier #afternoontea #drinkathome #circuitbreakersg #stopcovid19
