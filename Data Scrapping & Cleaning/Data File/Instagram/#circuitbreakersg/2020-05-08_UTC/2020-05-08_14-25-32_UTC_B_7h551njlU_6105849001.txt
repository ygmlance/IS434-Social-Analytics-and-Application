Sewing is a lifelong skill
.
Much like driving, cooking or picking up a sport etc, sewing is something that once learnt, can never be forgotton
.
Once you learn the basics, the only way forward is to improve upon, build on and make use of these skills
.
Spent some time replacing the velcro on the straps of all the chairs' cushion pad covers. They've long worn out and mum was already using paper clips to hold the straps together so the cushions stay in place
.
Circuit breaker stay home is proving to be a good time to tidy and mend things around the house, that we've all been putting off
.
Start small and share with me what you have done during this time of staying home!
