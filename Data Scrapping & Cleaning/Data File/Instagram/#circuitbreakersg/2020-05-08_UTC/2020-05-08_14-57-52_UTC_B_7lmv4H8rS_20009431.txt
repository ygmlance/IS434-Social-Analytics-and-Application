This one got to go out for a couple of hours today - a first since #circuitbreakersg started on 7th April. She was mighty pleased for the opportunity to be out even if it was for the purpose of visiting the dentist for an emergency appointment. ðŸ¤¯It was rather ironic to see her lying on the dentist chair, legs clearly relaxed as the dentist gave her the numbing jabs while I turned my gaze away, cringing. ðŸ¥´ #caterpillarAnya
