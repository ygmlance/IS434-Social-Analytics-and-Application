My husband was laid off a few days ago, a very unfortunate and difficult decision the company had to make as they were badly impacted by Covid19 travel halt. I couldn’t sleep that night and was bracing for how bad things will get but God has been pouring out His grace upon us, we are overflowing with thankfulness.
We are learning to praise Him, when He gives and also when He takes away.
