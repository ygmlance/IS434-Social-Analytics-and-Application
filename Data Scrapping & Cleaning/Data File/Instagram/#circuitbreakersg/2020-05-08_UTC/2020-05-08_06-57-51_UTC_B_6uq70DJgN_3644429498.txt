Day 32 of Circuit Breaker.⁣
⁣
I have been drooling at the pictures from @leptonyxscript whenever he visits @ahhuateochewnoodle.  I have always wanted to try the noodles but the location is so far at the West!!! Imagine my excitement when I knew that they have islandwide delivery during this circuit breaker period! ⁣

Didn’t get to place an order last week as they are closed on public holiday. I finally placed my order for this week as they deliver to North-East today. ⁣
