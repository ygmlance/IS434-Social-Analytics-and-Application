#CircuitBreakerSG D-32 „Äê Recipe „Äë
I was eggcited to receive some Salted Egg Powder from @EmakuIndonesia . So here's Salted Egg Prawns for dinner tonight.
üç§ De-shell & de-vine the prawns. Wash & pat dry. Marinate with salt & pepper.
üç§ Coat the prawns with beaten egg followed by corn flour; shaking off the excess. Fry the prawns and set aside.
üç§ Melt butter in a hot pan. Add garlic & curry leaves. Stir fry garlic till golden brown and add chilli padi.
üç§ Add salted egg powder and stir fry till bubbly. Return prawns into the pan. Mix well and dish up.

The other 2 dishes are Beansprout with Whitebaits and Tomato Omelette.

Enjoy your #dinner too!
