Beach day calls for my own cup of iced chocolate drink 🥤🍫 while I watched my kids play before Circuit Breaker!.
.
Yes I actually made my own drink with @GoldKili Chocolate Gao Siew Dai, kept it in a thermal flask and served it in my collapsible reusable cup, which came free with every box of 25 sachets ✌🏻.
.

Iced chocolate is my favourite drink to have when I just want to relax! Chocolate is a natural antidepressant which has a calming and mood-enhancing effect. Perfect for anyone who needs a happy boost, especially for busy mums like me 😅.
.

At home, my kids love to have it in the morning for breakfast.
.
Thankfully this chocolate malt drink is approved as the Healthier Choice with lower sugar, and is trans-fat free!.
