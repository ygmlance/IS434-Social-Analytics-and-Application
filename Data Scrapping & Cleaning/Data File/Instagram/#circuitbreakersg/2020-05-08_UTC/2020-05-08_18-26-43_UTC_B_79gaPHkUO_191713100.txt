🕢Dinner：
-Chicken curry over Rice
Did I mentioned overnight curry tasted so much better and delicious !
Cooked a big pot of curry chicken the day before and left it overnight, The flavor of a curry usually improves overnight as the spices were absorbed into the gravy and meat giving it more flavour. 
Chicken curry is usually serve with naan, prata, baguette,rice, noodles or sliced bread.

My husband always loves his curry with rice or prata.

let’s Eat, Jiak, Makan, Chi !
