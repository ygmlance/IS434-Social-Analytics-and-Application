Throwback to cakes from @cielpatisserie for supper before the circuit breaker! 🍰
✨
Had the strawberry shortcake and Oreo cheesecake, but was disappointed yet again. Sigh their cakes used to be so good. Gave them another chance but the standards were still quite subpar, especially the strawberry shortcake which became so bland but yet cloying somehow. The Oreo cheesecake fared better, but also got rather heavy on the palate towards the end. Personally find it to be a tad too creamy. I think I prefer the one from @catandthefiddlecakes now! 🧀
