sweet treat
.

fried ‘nian gao’ ~ sticky rice cake 炸年糕
.
swipe swipe pls- the process of frying, trying social distancing these sweet bites😄
.
these ‘nian gao’ are wrapped with spring roll pastry. some are with a slice of pumpkin n some without. they are crispy on the outside n gooey sweetness on the inside. it’s best pair with a cup of hot green tea or chinese Oolong tea🍵
.
Mmmm...not forgetting my little granddaughter (miss charlotte) i made five even smaller bites to let her try😄👧🏻
