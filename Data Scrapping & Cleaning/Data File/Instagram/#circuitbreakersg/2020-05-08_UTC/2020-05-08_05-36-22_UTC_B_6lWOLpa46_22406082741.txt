You didn’t gain the excess weight within a week so why would you expect yourself to shed it in that period of time? 🤷🏻‍♀️
. 
This mentality is one of the biggest barriers many face during their health & fitness journey.
.⠀
The more you resist these foods, the more they haunt your thoughts. And the more they haunt your thoughts, the more they control your actions.
.⠀
Instead of restricting yourself from these foods, give yourself permission to slowly introduce them into your diet with a goal of waiting until you’re hungry to eat. A cookie here and there won’t stall your weight loss, but being caught in the binge-restrict cycle. . 
Consistency is key so as long as you constantly remain in a caloric deficit, your determination will pay off! ☺️👍🏼👍🏼
