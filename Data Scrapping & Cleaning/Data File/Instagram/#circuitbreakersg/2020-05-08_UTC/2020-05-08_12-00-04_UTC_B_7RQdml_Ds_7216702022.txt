Love Lockdown

An intimate night of poetry, music and stories on finding and keeping love during a lockdown.

To paraphrase Kanye:
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
It’s $300, if I stand too close
And that haunted me, as i stay home

Circuit breaker measures have many of us working from home but how does one love from home? Get up close and personal with poets Marc Nair and Venezia May, singer-songwriter Shak'thiya Subramaniamm - Shak and Host Ajay Govinda as they spill the beans and share their tales of love, make-ups and breakups!

Aunt Agony is in!

Sometimes, you can’t talk to the people you know and maybe you feel you could get some from another perspective. Our online bards will be opening the hearts to hear you out as your personal Aunt Agony.
If you're looking for ways to spice up your love life, ask our experts for advice. Slide into our DM or shoot away at ajay@wordforward.org

Don't worry, we won't reveal any dark secrets. Selected letters will be read out at the event, anonymously
Tickets are $5 via the link below.
