Steak Fried Rice for the next day. 
The great thing about fried rice is that it is still gonna be great the next day. Just heat it up again in the pan and let the flavours wake up.

In my second video I decided to be more experimental and change the camera angle a little, with a close up POV shot. I think it is more visually captivating and at the same time having clarity in the steps to the recipe.

What do y’all think about the close up POV angle?
-
Every video is really satisfying to me. Having that vision in your head but can’t seem to have the right words to describe at that point of time.
All that thought being manifested into the video, to me it gives me a strong ‘creative high’, making the hours of work and editing being so worth it, or rather seeing it as just part of the creative process rather than work.

Hope y’all enjoyed watching my videos as much I did making them.
