⬇RECIPE⠀
⠀
Introducing brainless cooking day! 😜⠀
⠀
Kung Pao Chicken - Veganized (serving size, 2~4 minions or 1 GIANT 😆)⠀
Veg Roasted Chicken - 15 pcs / est. 200g? (@fvfssg, 天福)⠀
Instant Chopped Garlic - UP TO YOU! (@fairpricesg )⠀
Chilli Padi Red - 5 (haha, my family loves spicy but if you don't then, UP TO YOU!) (@greenies.sg )⠀
Kung Pao Sauce - UP TO YOU! (@fvfssg, KB)⠀
Oil (Olive & Sesame) - UP TO YOU!⠀
Spring Onion - for garnish (@greenies.sg )⠀
⠀
I like to add a tiny little bit of sesame oil with olive because it makes me happy. Stir fry the chicken pieces till you're happy and then put it aside. Stir fry garlic in low-medium heat > chillies > kung pao sauce > add some water > chicken pieces > done! 😎⠀
⠀
NOTE TO SELF:⠀
You love this but you honestly didn't think it tasted anything like the traditional kung pao, you should rename this to Spicy BBQ Chicken instead. STILL AWESOME, GOOD JOB! Future self, please try this sauce with the 'proper' kung pao ingredients again, thank you in advance! 😘⠀
