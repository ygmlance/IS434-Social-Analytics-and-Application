Got a request for an interview last week about how magicians are coping during this time of Circuit Breaker. The article is out! Thank you @thenewpaper ðŸ˜„

I was skeptical about being able to connect through a virtual performance online initially. But after doing a few shows now, i realise that it is possible! The connection is not just in the magic, it is in us to communicate our humanity through the medium.

If you are interested in the magic book i am printing, you can preorder it on the link in my bio :)
(Will be starting the print of the 2nd batch once we have 30 orders)
