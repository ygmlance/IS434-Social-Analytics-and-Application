🕞 Banana Cake 🍌🍰🍌
Ooops ! I did it again! 😬
I just can’t resist myself from buying more bananas and bake this Delicious, soft and moist cake that is ridiculously easy to make.

Paired it with a cup of lungo, the bitterness of The coffee balance out by the sweet and fatty flavours of the cake.
Make it a sinful, perhaps ?🤪
