Wasn't supposed to cook tonight but then realised I had better clear the fridge a little so we ended up with a 'chapalang' (colloquial local slang for a random mixture of various elements) dinner of all sorts of stuff... Pan-fried pork belly, veggie lasagna, pork meatballs and fried salmon skin for day 32's dinner... üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
