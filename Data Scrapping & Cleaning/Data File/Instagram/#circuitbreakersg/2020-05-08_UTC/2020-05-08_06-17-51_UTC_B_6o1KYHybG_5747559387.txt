Dear Students and Parents, thank you for registering your interest in our Free Online Ukulele Lessons! We have decided to make videos and upload it online so you can play them *AT YOUR OWN CONVENIENCE üòÉ* Before we start releasing our online tutorial videos of some songs to learn, we also filmed 2 videos to help you get ready for the lessons.

This is the first video, and it will teach you how to *Tune your own Ukulele*. This will be an activity on its own for one day of learning. For younger kids, parents will need to go through the steps with them. Do pause the video when you need to take time to understand the steps. 
Please contact your teacher if you need help. Also, stay tuned for our next video tomorrow, *‚ÄúUkulele Refresher Guide‚Äù*. Hope this video was helpful to you. Feel free to share this with anyone who wants to self-learn the Ukulele. Have fun!.
