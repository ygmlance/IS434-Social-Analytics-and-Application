Puff pastry with ham and cheese. First time making the puff pastry fully from scratch and I’m happy. 👩🏻‍🍳It’s so difficult to fold the dough in this Singapore weather, the butter simply melt too fast. The happiest part of baking is not only the process but the sharing with family 💕🍽#puffpastry #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakerbaking #lockdownlife #stayhomewithascott
