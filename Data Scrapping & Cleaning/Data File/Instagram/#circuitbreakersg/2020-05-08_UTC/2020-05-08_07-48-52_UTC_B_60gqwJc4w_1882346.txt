Their mission: To draw their mom and themselves 👩‍👦👩‍👧 My mission: To demonstrate the drawing to my class using #jamboard in #googlemeet #googleedu and to see their awesome work in #seesawchat and #flipgridforall 👩‍💻 This online meet took a record-breaking 45 minutes to finish!!! I am so proud of these 5-6 year old kiddos because they were so eager to finish their drawing. I think they endured my drawing session because they will do anything for their moms ❤ (normally, our online class lasts for 5-10 minutes due to their age and attention span) #saisrocks #cognitaway Advanced #happymothersday to all #momsofinstagram #aunties #titasofinstagram #teachersofinstagram who act as second parents, #pawrent and #plantparent 🥂
