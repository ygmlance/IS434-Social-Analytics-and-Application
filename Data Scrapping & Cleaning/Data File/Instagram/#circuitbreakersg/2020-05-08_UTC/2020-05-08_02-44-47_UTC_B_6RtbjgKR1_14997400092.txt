So which day of Circuit Breaker has it been??
Hopefully everyone's been exercising #selfcare during this period. 😊
-
Am definitely missing & not missing going out. Because I miss working out with my squad under the ☀️ and 🌙. Yet, I do enjoy the time staying at home as well. I had lesser takeouts, more time to workout (sometimes 2x a day), picking up new skills (esp. online technical skills), personal development, etc...
Basically I took care of myself, physically and mentally. -
Be it Circuit Breaker is ending or its gonna be extended, I believe we all need to practice self care.
