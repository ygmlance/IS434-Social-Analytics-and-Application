As part of the #stayhomewithgeneco series, we held an IG #PowerFamTimeFridays Challenge for families and received many creative green crafts! We hope all of you enjoyed making them with your families as much as we enjoyed going through your submissions!⠀
⠀
Here are the 10 winning submissions in this post, so swipe left to find out whether your family is one of them! You will each walk away with $100 worth of Dairy Farm vouchers! Please DM us for more information.⠀
