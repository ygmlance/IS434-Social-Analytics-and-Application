🍛CB Day32 - Lunch Time🍛
.
Today's lunch is prepared by me!
.
Cooked the Japanese curry after breakfast before I start WFH!
.
Keep warm in the pot and steal a 5mins toilet break to start off the rice cooker and throw the frozen chicken fillet into the oven! And wala! you get lunch.
.
🧚🏻‍♀️*POOF*🧚🏻‍♀️ You get a self declared "professional" looking Jap curry rice!
.
p.s Meat Monster Approves 👍👍👍
