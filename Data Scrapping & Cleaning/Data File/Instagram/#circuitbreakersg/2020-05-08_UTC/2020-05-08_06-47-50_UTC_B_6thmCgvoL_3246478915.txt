Still remember the overwhelming crowds of people queuing for their signature crabs after the restaurant was featured on Lian He Zao Bao? The Chicken Dance Auntie of flambe chicken? And the ready-to-eat crab vending machine? That's is the House of Seafood http://houseofseafood.sg/ I always thought that their restaurant only sell crabs but actually they have ZI CHAR as well as home delivery.

The founder-Mr Francis Ng.
In 1995, Mr Ng run his first business in car dealing firm with his hard earned saving. He saw the elderly picking up cardboards on the streets to earn a living, thinking to provide some help he offered the elderly money but was rejected; the elderly told him that she can support oneself. Whereas he decided to start a F&B business so to provide job opportunities for the elderly.
Without any experience in F&B and he can't distinguish between male & female crabs which he faced ridicule from the people around him. The negatively did not bring him down but motivated him.
Mr Ng show the attitude that the road to success is don't give up and focus on your goals.
