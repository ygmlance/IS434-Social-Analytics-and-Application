Thai style Pineapple fried rice with prawns in a 🍍

@cpfoodssg  Mexican wings🍗, so good! not very spicy, taste similar to Mcwings. 
Bibik’s Choice Yakitori 
The fried rice taste sweet with a hint of sourness from the pineapple. You can incorporate sweet ingredients to ur pineapple fried rice like raisins, chinese sausage and pork floss. It will taste well together with the fried rice🤤
