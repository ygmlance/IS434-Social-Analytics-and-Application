Day dreaming of a relaxing spa day? 
How about a spa day at home instead?
Don’t we all need some time to relax whether you’re working from home or constantly doing house chores? Kids doing home-based learning or simply bored being stuck home? Plus all the news stresses you out. 
Breathe. Relax. Recharge

Spa at home does not need an aesthetician or a professional masseur.

Here’s how to achieve:
Simply pop on your favorite facial sheet.
Light up a scented candle if you have.
Add a little relaxing music and Voila!

If you aren’t contented with just facial sheet and you think you’d need a full body massage, here’s how:
Lay down in massage position and ask the kids for help. They are the best masseur you can get. 😉

Not enough of pampering yet?
Finish it up with a little lip treatment.
