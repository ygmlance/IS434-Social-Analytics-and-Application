A very British tea this afternoon in sunny Singapore, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe day (official end of the second world war). Remembering with gratitude all those who fought in that war, wars since and who continue to fight for their country today. #veday75 #lestweforget #timefortea #noplacelikehome #circuitbreakersg
