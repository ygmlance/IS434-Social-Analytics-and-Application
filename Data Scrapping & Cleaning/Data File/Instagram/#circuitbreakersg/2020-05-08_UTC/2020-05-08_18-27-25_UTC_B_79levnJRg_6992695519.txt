Happy 14th Birthday to my Eldest... Today is Day 32 of #circuitbreakersg and to be honest i really enjoy this period of time... having hubs together is a bonus as he always works late home and sometimes OT on Sundays... .
Of course there are times we shout and scream at each other but we got back together again fast... we sleep together... we eat together... we play and watch movie together everyday... i will definitely miss this period when we goes back to our usual routine after CB... .
Im of course very stressed up with certain things at home this period too but thanks to my kids and hubs support and very nice dearies out ther listening to me... .
This is also the longest time im away from my family and i miss them so so so much... this is the only year im not there with my family for my Mom's birthday yesterday... but we had a video call with her and sing birthday song to her... kids were so happy and excited to sing to her...
.
Will treasure the next 3 weeks even more with the kids and hubs... .
