Fontana Di Trevi ⛲️
Watercolour on Paper.
———
Not a fan of structured and linear works because I feel very constricted and ‘boxed’ to a certain measurement and I feel it’s one way to make art-making feel very uninspiring. This was definitely tedious and intricate but I went by my own feels and gave it my own artistic take so please bear with me, cause I ain’t an architect. This is 1 of 2 from a Commissioned Work and I’m really grateful for the support I’ve been getting in this trying time. Working really hard to practice my craft so that I can constantly improve and definitely this one is not something I would reach out and do on my own accord. Always work hard towards your goal and the rest will fall into place. PS; This Place is really travel goals. One day!
