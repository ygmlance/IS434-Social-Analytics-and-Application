Focaccia bread!! My very first attempt at making bread was on Wednesday and I made a huge mess in the kitchen lol
.
.
Recipe (yields 2 medium/ 1 large focaccia)
- 2 cups bread flour
- 1 cup water
- 1-2tsp salt (depends on you)
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp dry yeast
- 2 tbsp olive oil ♡ mix everything together until you form a well-combined wet dough
♡ flour your workspace and knead for 10-30s ♡ rest the dough for 10min
♡ repeat this 3-4 times until you get a nice elastic ball of dough which passes the "window pane test"
♡ proof for about 1hour (or until it has doubled in size)
♡ flour your workspace generously again
♡ prob holes with all your fingers to form many small craters and coat with lots of olive oil (be careful not to flatten it too much of you may deflate the dough and it may be too thin to pick up and transfer onto your tray)
♡ line your baking tray with parchment and coat it with lots of olive oil
♡ transfer onto your dough onto your baking tray
♡ add whatever ingredients you please (add a sprinkle of coarse salt for a nice finishing touch)
♡ leave for final prove (30 min) and preheat oven to 200-230°c
♡ bake for 15-20min until golden brown .
