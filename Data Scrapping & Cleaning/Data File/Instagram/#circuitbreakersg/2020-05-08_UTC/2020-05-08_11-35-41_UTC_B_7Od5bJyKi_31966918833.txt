I heard people mentioned a Japanese food court call “Donkey Donkey”. Now I know it’s pronounced and written as Donki ! Came here by mistake as I was sick of hawker food at Yishun. Once got the chance to go to the town must eat something good and non-hawker 😅

花多眼乱... A bowl of rice with my favorite pork and half boiled egg is the best match! Aburi Pork it is!! One of the cheapest meal here. 🤣
.
I enjoyed the food sitting at the corner of the food court plus people watching. So many office workers came here for lunch. Some of them in a group, some of them sitting at the high bench if they are alone. High bench is facing the wall ! Why? So boring... 🤣
