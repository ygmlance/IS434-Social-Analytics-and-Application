‚úì Teochew steamed Chinese Pomfret ÊñóÈØß üêü

I use:
1. 1 Chinese Pomfret (cleaned)
2. Thin strips and sliced Ginger 
3. Minced Garlic
4. Red Onion
5. Cherry tomato
6. Dried mushrooms 
7. Hokto mushrooms
8. Salted plums
9. Salted vegetables
10. Salt

I cook:
1. Soak the chinese mushrooms in water until it softens. Then, remove the stems and thinly sliced them.
2. Pan fry the mushrooms with some minced garlic. Meanwhile, marinate the fish with salt on both sides.
3. Add the mushrooms on the fish with tomato, salted plums and salted vegetables. Also, add in some sliced ginger inside the fish. 
4. Bring the fish to steam for about 15 minutes.
5. For garnishing and enhanced taste:
Fry ginger, garlic and red onion until golden brown. Garnish these on the fish once it is ready to be served!
Note: Usually this is done just by steaming but try frying these for fragrance!
