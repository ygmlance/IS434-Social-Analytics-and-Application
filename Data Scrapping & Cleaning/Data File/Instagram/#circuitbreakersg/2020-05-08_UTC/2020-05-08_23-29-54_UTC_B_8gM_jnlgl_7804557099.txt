Beautiful morning skies for all #CircuitBreakerSG Day 33

Woke up to a beautiful pinkish sunrise and by the time i whipped out the camera, the hues of the sky had changed to this. ðŸ’š

Our fast paced lives do feel like that sometimes, you blink and the moment is gone. I guess thatâ€™s how the phrase â€˜In the Blink of an Eyeâ€™ came about. 
If this has been a difficult season for you, take comfort that as with all things that it will be over in the blink of an eye.

Meanwhile, have an amazing long weekend my friends! Enjoy this awesome period of pause, rest and time with loves ones.

Blessed Days!
