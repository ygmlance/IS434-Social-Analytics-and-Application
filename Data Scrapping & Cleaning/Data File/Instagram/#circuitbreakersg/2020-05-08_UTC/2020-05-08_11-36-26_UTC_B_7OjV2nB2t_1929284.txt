CB Day 32 of 56 . These two bottles must be like treasures now. For I still see a lot of IG comments from people living in Singapore mentioning that they still canâ€™t find pasta sauce.  I must appreciate that due to some work issues, I have to officially travel all the way down to Vivocity, which gave me a chance to check out the Marks & Spenser store there.
