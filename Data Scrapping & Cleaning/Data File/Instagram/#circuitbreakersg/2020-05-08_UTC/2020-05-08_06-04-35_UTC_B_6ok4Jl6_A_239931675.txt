With McDonald's not reopening anytime soon, there had been a lot of rave about people finding frozen food items that are similar to McD's.
Sis bought the highly raved chicken thigh patties which the articles say that has 90 over percent similarity to McSpicy.
So I replicate McD's McSpicy for lunch today with whatever I can find at home.. Also took step-by-step pictures of the assembling process ðŸ¤£
My verdict: Totally Yumz! ðŸ˜‹ Tried the patty on its own yday and found it too spicy.. But it is totally ok today with cheese, mayo and shredded cabbage..
