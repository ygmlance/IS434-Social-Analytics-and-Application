Day 32/56â€¢Stayhome Snack 
Do you know this cute lion? ðŸ˜€ 
I made Billy & Chalky, from the cartoon series "Counting with Paula" , IMO @countingwithpaula is a good show for preschooler! Mini K had been watching it on TV & singing the catchy song too! And he kept telling me he likes Chalky (on this plate) so much! ðŸ˜† but boy, Mummy spent more time making Billy compared to Chalky ah! .
Now showing Season 4 on weekday mornings @mediacorpch5 , you can catch it anytime on @mewatch.mediacorp too!
