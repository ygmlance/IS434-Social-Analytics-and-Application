My comfort food usually involves spicy and savoury food.

And Ramadan, and being under lockdown, means that I need to satisfy my cravings by making things at home.

Sambal gila gila (crazy sambal, as my aunt likes to call it due to the amount of chili padi she uses in it) is a variation of the sambal belacan, where it has onions and dried anchovies added to the chili, belacan (prawn paste), sugar and lime juice.

Everything but the seasoning are fried and then blended. Then the blended sambal is fried again and seasoned to my liking.

I'm really happy with how it turned out. Now I can have it with everything, and it makes a good base for fried rice too!

What does your comfort food look like? Do you make it regularly?
