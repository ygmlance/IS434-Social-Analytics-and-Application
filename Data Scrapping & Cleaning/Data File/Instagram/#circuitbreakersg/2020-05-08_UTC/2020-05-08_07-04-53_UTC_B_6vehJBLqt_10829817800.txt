Joseph Phelps Insignia 2016  is a blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 1% Malbec. Bottled in January 2019, aged for 24 months in 100% new French oak barrels although the oak influence is not overpowering. Saturated garnet-purple color with pinkish rim. The nose was shy when itâ€™s first opened and it took almost 3 hours to unveil itâ€™s beautiful black berries , clove, cedar wood and cocoa powder.  On the palate, it offers ripe plum, blackberry character with roasted coffee, cocoa and subtle flower to a long velvety finish ! An elegant wine with complexity and depth. The amazing thing about well-made Napa wine is that it is approachable when itâ€™s young due to the balance of fruitiness and acidity. Furthermore the tannin is rounded and well-integrated due to so called technology! ðŸ˜¬ RP99,
