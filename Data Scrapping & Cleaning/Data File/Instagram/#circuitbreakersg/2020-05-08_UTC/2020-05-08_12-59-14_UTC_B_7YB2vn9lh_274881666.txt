Mystery Thursdays III (Virtual edition)
Theme: Something old, something new 
Budget: ~$70 (for 1 pax)

A joyous celebratory meal with P who knew that I love having a good meal with great company. 😉

I knew that this meal is special when the person delivering it is wearing a crisp white shirt and black pants. Classic #StRegis.

“The old. Assortment of matured cheeses. Firm, and delectable. The new. Burst of fresh italian cow milk. Supple, and always a delight. The new old. Crustacean pasta plated on takeaway packaging. Garnished with great conversations, served to you on telecommuting platforms.” (P,2020)
.
Overall, a good meal with great company.🍸 #throwback #italy #JR #labrezza #Stregis.
