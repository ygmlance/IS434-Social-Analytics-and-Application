Applying FAIR principle into my daily practice as well.

Findable- Prior to passion, building awareness should be by appropriate person at appropriate & perfect timing.

Accessible- It should be accessible either internally or externally, to build control and strength.

Interoperable- It should be a standardized and annotated plan, which suits our needs and requirement.

Reusable- It should be part of essential elements to maximise the value and execute the plan properly.

CB period, allowing me to read, digest and applying the same concept in trial study into my daily practice. Every scientific breakthrough, there are countless hours spent shifting through vast amounts of scientific literature, analysing volumes of data, and creating linkages at the intersections of information. To have breakthrough in our practice, it also requires tremendous of experimenting, keep practising, improving our mobility & strength. Ultimately, “Consistency & Patience is the key”. Documenting my handstand clips for my future reference. The roadmap for my hand-balancing journey, a long long way to go. Yet I believe unified data sets would yield fruitful insights in future as long as I don’t quit. I love HS, as it helps to keep my focus and concentration at the moment when I have my practice.  #handstandpractice #handstanddrills #consistencyiskey #patienceisprogress #yogichandstands #circuitbreakersg #practiceafterclass #virtualhandstandclass
