As reviewed by our customers 💞:
"Sambal pomfret dish complimented very well with white rice. Fish was very crispy n the sambal crisps were flavourful," "The sambal fish is very good, very crispy with lots of well-flavoured sambal..." "The highlight goes to the Sambal Pomfret that is topped with a generous servicing of aromatic sambal. The combination of the spiciness and crispiness was rather shiok."
