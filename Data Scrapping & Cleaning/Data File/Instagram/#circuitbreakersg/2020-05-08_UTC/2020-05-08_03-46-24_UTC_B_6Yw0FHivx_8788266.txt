In other news: My taste buds are getting just alittle bored with the south east Asian cuisine or the usual salads I'm making day in and out etc. So~~~I have some ideas on tackling other recipes from the countries I have visited. :) .

Next up, I'd be trying to make Pita Zeljanica which translates to Savoury Pie with Spinach, Balkan recipe which is a dish native to the country, #Croatia (been missing travelling quite a bit so figured I'd bring the country to me) ðŸ¤£.
