Ramadan 2020 brings about a different vibe.
What would have been the routine Iftar with friends and family, splurgefest at the various bazaars and of course wastage, now represent a deeper appreciation for the awareness of those less fortunate.

The truth is for most of us, we face a loss in one way or another.
Loss of income or part of. .
Loss of catch-up time with friends and loved ones that we only can catch in this meaningful month..
Loss of our total freedom of movement..
And most distinctly, Loss of access to our various places of faith, devotion and solitude, regardless your belief. Hopefully, when we pull through this, it becomes our renewed way of life.
