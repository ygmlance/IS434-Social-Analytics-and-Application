What's one thing this circuit breaker made you realise that you can live without?

I'm honestly ok without bubble tea, dining out, retail therapy, going to the movies / hairdresser / library / karaoke and erm, exercising hahahaha ðŸ˜‚

But I miss my family and friends, dressing up, and basically just heading to ANYWHERE besides the supermarket or hawker centre without wondering if there's gonna be a long queue.

We're more than halfway through, 3 more weeks to go!
