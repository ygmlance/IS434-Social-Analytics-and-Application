Warning: Addictive and probably will all be eaten in one seating :-) Snacking is one thing I know I am facing plenty during the Covid-19, we tend to over-eat, especially when we get bored. With many people not exercising as much, it is important that we make sure we are eating the right stuff, not just snacking on the bad stuff! For that, instead of buying snacks, I make my own so I have more control over what the intake is.

So here is my little pleasure, something that only takes 15 mins to make, but lasts several days (not for
me haha) and is a great protein hit too. 
Here is a list of ingredients that I used to make my Protein Snack Balls: - 1 cup of Oats
- Handful of Dates
- Two scoops of Protein - 2 pieces of Dark Chocolate
- 2 scoops of Peanut Butter  and @prosnackssg
- 3 Tablespoons of Cacao -1 handful of Cashew Nuts 
This is a super simple recipe. 
Mix everything together - if it is too dry then add some water or coconut water to it. 
Make them in to any shape you want (balls, cubes, bars)
Put in the fridge for an hour and feast!

DONE!!!! Super easy and very tasty :-)
