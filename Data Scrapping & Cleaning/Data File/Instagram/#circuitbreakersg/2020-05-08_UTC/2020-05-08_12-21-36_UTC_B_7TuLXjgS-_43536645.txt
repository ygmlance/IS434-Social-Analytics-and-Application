Circuit Breaker Day 32: Had a sumptuous dinner delivered with ❤️. Though we can’t dine with our friends physically, we can make their day by sending them a meal. And support local F&B along the way. I’m going to share my blessing with my other friends & make their day too. #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakersgchallenge #stayhomeforsg #sgunited
