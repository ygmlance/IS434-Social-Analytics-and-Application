This is my comfort food. üòò

Today was a rare occasion that I was cooking at 6.30 p.m. and dinner was ready by 7.15p.m.! Ivan is from Spain and the Spanish dinner time is around 9p.m.! I was very satisfied with my Salmon with an Asian Glaze as named by online recipes. It is a very delicious and easy recipe. You just need soya sauce, ginger and garlic. Delicious salmon cannot be overcooked. If you have guests, just buy some spring onions to make it look nicer, just like make up. Ivan thinks it is fantastic and so do I.

The üçÖ scrambled eggs needs soya sauce and sesame oil. I gave it a twist by adding fish sauce. Fry the tomatoes first with the sauce before adding the scrambled eggs. Ivan thinks it is fantastic and so do I.

The last dish was a can of Lo Han Chai cooked with frozen broccoli. I bought both when the minister mentioned that Singaporeans might need to eat frozen vegetables. I don't know if he is joking but just in case. Ivan asked me where I got all the carrots, mushrooms and funny looking things in the Lo Han Chai as they were not in the fridge. I didn't want to tell him that they existed in a can as he worships fresh food. (If he reads this, he will know now.) I mumbled - outside the fridge. Ivan thinks that the Lo Han Chai sauce tasted strong and so do I. He was just being a very polite European. Tasted strong means not nice.

He is taking care of Daniel now while I am typing this to entertain myself - aka Me Time. Hope you enjoy my post. #mypineappledays_cook üòç
