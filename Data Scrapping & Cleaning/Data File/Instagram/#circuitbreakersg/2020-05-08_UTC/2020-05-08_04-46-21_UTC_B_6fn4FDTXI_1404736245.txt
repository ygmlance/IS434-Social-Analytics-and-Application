#Forky from Toy Story (yes, we are fans!) made special appearance in our artwork today. I totally love these tulips. Being a Momma with 'non-instinctive artistic capabilities ðŸ˜¬' (that is - I gotto try a bit hard!), my kids' exposure to artistic explosions at home include many a 'hacks' like these ðŸ˜…. They take so much pride in their work (and mess), and let me have a coffee in peace while they do it. And let's face it - there won't be a bbq/picnic in the park for a while now, so this puts Forky to some grand indoorsy use for now ðŸ˜…! #toystory #toystory4 #artwork #painting #paint #paintinghacks #kidsofinstagram #kids #painting #lockdown #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #stayhome #ShivInDaHouse #Ruhanster
