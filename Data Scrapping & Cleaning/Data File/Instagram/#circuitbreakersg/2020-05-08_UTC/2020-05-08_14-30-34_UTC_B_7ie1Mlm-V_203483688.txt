Today’s reduced hours bike ride - it was a beautiful day and nice and quiet in the ECP so I figured I’d see how far I could get heading East to the Coastal Park Connector. The cycle path once I’d left the park was a bit bleak, all concrete up to and past the naval base, but it was deceptively easy and flat so I didn’t turn back until I reached the corner of the island 4km shy of Changi Beach. I hadn’t realised what a massive wind assist I’d had until I turned around and found myself cycling into a strong wind all the way back which was absolutely brutal. A good 30km round trip though.
