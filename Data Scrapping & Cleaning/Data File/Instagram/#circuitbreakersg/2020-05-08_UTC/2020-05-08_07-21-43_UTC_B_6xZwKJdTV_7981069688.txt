Freddie Redd Quintet - Shades of Redd, 1960.  This is possibly one of the best composed albums from the era. Freddie Redd had just completed the score for the play The Connection and started to find some recognition for his work as composer and pianist. Redd has both #jackiemclean and #tinabrooks in mind when he composed intricate parts for them. The music doesn’t appear to see much improvisation but the detail is almost already perfect. It’s like music from a movie. Forces you to visualise. Reminds me never to overlook the lesser known jazz musicians.  #freddieredd #shadesofredd #paulchambers #louishayes #bluenoterecords
