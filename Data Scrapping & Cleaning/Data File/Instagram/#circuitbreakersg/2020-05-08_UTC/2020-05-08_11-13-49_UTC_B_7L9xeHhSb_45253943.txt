Some hiccups while preparing the ingredients - I actually accidentally switched the unit from grams to ml 🤦🏻‍♀️ I was like... “something is wrong with the dough” when it was mixing in the machine then realised my negligence! Had to save the dough by doing some trial and error. Thankfully and luckily, I managed to save the bread but it’s not as fluffy as it was supposed to be but still soft enough for my own expectations. Lesson learnt - always triple check the scale unit! #whatibaked #whatimade #homemade #bread #baking #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #oneproofbread #橘子麻麻的廚房 #自己做#烘培 #吐司 #山形吐司 #一次發酵 #麵包 #我是麵包控 #防疫 #隔離生活 #煮婦人生 #自己煮
