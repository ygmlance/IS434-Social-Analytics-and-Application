Day 31. The day started off with an overcast. Our mood was affected as Dad was not feeling well this morning. We sent him to hospital for a thorough check. Grateful to the hospital staff who took good care of him as we are not allowed to be with him. Hopefully he will be discharged soon. Came home to see the little ones spending time with each other. Late lunch for the little one - with the leftover curry last night. Evening is brighter, especially when Dad called to tell us he managed to nap and finish dinner. â˜º #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #mybunnyathome #realfood #homecookedmeal #instadaily
