Things to do with the kids #49

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Titus, you know you can't go out. It's late, and those bullies were out again this evening." "But, I always sit outside and watch the world go by and listen to the toads." "And then the bully comes and bites your ear." "I'll bite him back this time." "Titus, you always say that, but you never do. Jason and Dad saw him off again this evening." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
