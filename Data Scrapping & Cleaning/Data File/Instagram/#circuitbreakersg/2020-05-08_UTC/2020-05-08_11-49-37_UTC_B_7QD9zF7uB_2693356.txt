[SWIPE LEFT FOR TUTORIAL] I know some of us girls (and guys hhehe) are going crazy because we can't thread our brows ever since CB...⠀
⠀
I've tried out this tool and it's SO easy that I may not go back to threading after this! (The hair doesnt grow out that fast. Even if it does you can do it yourself every few days if needed)⠀
⠀
Drop a comment if you wanna know where to get this tool. Just a few dollars for 3 pcs.⠀
⠀
And tag a friend who needs to redo their brows!!!⠀
