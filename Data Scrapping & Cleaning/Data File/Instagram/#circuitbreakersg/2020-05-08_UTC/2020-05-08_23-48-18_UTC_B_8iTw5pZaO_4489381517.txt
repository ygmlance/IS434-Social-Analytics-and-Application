Happy Mother’s Day Weekend Y’all❤️🙌🏻💐⁣
Here’s a bouquet of Carnations painted between my pumping sessions dedicated to all you mommies~ ⁣

Swipe left to see the details and pictures of my adorable child :)👉🏻 ⁣

I have been mom for six weeks now. ⁣
My due date was brought forward three weeks earlier than the initial EDD because of an unexpected situation, I was also being advised to changed my birth plan to c-section to avoid any risk of complication. ⁣
Thankfully we managed to finalised baby’s room and get the essentials sorted in time before our bundle of joy’s arrival. On Friday March 27th, my precious baby boy was safely delivered into my arms PTL! 🙌🏻❤️👶🏻✨⁣
⁣
Six weeks later I’m here in my milk stained top, walking around with untidy hair and nursing bra opened with boobs hanging out🤦🏻‍♀️😂...Some days I felt so lost I’d cry in the shower and teared while I pump. But whenever my son is in my arms I am comforted. ⁣
I am grateful that the Lord is always here with me to guide and to comfort, holding me tight like how I would hold my child. ⁣
I may not have everything altogether now, but I know it’s going to get better, and to all you moms who have overcome, you know you are truly awesome🌈🙌🏻❤️✨!⁣
⁣
The journey of motherhood have only just begun, I promise to appreciate every little moments ahead and enjoy the ride! 🎉👶🏻❤️~ ⁣
