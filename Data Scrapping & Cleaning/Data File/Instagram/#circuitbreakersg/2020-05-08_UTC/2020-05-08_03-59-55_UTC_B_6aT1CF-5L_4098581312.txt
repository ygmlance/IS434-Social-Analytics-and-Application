“Be not afraid for I am with you”| ☀️ being isolated, this circuit breaker has really given me time to explore some of my existing fears and emotions which I never had the chance to when I was busier with my weekly plans. During some days when I feel down or reduced to a ball, some of my insecurities started bubbling up again and I questioned my growth and felt impatient. I’m felt that I was not strong enough or adaptive; always giving in to the same old fears.

this circuit breaker and pandemic have been great reminders that there are things that are in my control and that are not. The areas where I still find myself imperfect or small can seem very lonely and tiresome. I wonder where the Lord is in these areas and even in the places of suffering around the world. But there are reasons for His will and I’m called to wait and grow in patience and stillness. 
if you are also struggling some way, I pray that the Lord may bless you with the grace to wait for Him and trust in Him. He is with you right now even if you don’t feel it, think it or know it. 
sending my love, co •
