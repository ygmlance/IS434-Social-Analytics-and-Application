So... I was trying to get the flavour of Uncle Leeâ€™s Bai Mee Fen (ç™¾ç±³ç²‰) of White Bee Hoon. The restaurant used to be at Teck Chye Terrace.

This rendition of mine was alright, but I couldnâ€™t hit those fragrant notes of Uncle Leeâ€™s.

I think I may need to tweak the recipe a little bit more. ðŸ¤”

Anyway! Itâ€™s Friday! Enjoy your weekend!
