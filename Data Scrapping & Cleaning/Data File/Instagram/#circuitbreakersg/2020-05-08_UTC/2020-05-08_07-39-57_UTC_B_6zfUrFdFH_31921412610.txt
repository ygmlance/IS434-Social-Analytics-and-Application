[Miss Chia] Hello all!!! How are you this wonderful fourth day of the May Holidays? Anyway, what have you all been reading? Well, I recently (mistakenly) bought @roshanichokshi ‘s #arushahandtheendoftime . I didn’t realise that I already have a copy (right book) from a much earlier time and then my finger got trigger-happy on the mouse and here I have two copies of the same story, but from different publishers and, obviously, different covers. Honestly, I prefer the second cover (left book). So, #happymistake ! The cover shows more of what the story is about and for those of you who have difficulty imagining, it gives you a good enough idea as to what’s happening. So, what’s the story about? Well, it’s about an Indian-American girl who discovered that the Indian myths she grew up hearing are all real. If you have been following the Percy Jackson series of books, then this is somewhat similar. For me, I find this story a great start to learning a bit more of #indianmythology as I do get curious whenever I pass a Hindu temple, with all the colourful statues out on the walls. I’m sure some of you are curious too. Well, I know as we are still under this #circuitbreakersg here in #singapore until we go back to school in June, why not borrow this online from our National Library? #whathaveyoubeenreading #readingismagic #mayholidays #stayhome #englishandliterature
