Still havent got my hands on new yarns, so #babyblue it is again. 
Tried the #freemaskpattern on @yarnspirations with cat whiskers inspired by @midknits
Have yet to line it with a fabric pocket for a filter insert to improve its efficacy against airborne microbes
Pattern was easy to follow and possibly my 1st time trying hdc and hdc2tog. Especially pleased with how uniform the ties turned out; I havent had much issues with tension as a crochet newbie
Counting down to restocking of yarns in SG so that I can finally can my hands on some for more projects ðŸ§¶ðŸ§¶ðŸ§¶
