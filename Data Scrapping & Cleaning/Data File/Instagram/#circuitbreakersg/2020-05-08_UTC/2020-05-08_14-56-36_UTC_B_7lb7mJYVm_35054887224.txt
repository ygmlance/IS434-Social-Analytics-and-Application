How I spend my #circuitbreakersg weekends and PH?

Now, a typical weekend and PH for a noob chef like me is spending hours in the kitchen talking to the phone, fridge and ingredients on what to cook for my toddler, #blueberrycheok (bbc) and whether she will eat.

I legit only started learning to cook properly when bbc started her weaning journey last year (don't ask me how I managed to pass my Culinary Science module in TP while doing my Dip in HTM eons ago). I honestly googled a lot on easy-to-cook recipes for babies/toddlers, check out mummies who cook on instagram and so on but at the end of the day, I'm still kinda clueless. I found comfort in using food pouches initially (and very often) but as any mother, I feel very guilty for not giving bbc "the best". So, I learn to cook simple stuff for bbc when I can. But, there were and will still be days I gave and will give food pouches especially when I'm just not feeling it. (Thankfully, my MIL is around to help on weekdays to ensure Ally eats fairly well.) Hope this post can help mothers like me who can't cook well and also offer food pouches and use food powder. Whatever it is, we need to cut ourselves some slack. We are already doing our best.
