Capellini with Torched Squid
----------------------------------------------
Some of you must be tired of looking at all my amateur attempts at asian food. So here's the type of food that most dominates this instagram. Pasta. True to myself, this mini plate was conceived using leftover seafood tomato sauce from a Marinara that failed to make it to an instagram post (blame bad lighting) . The capellini was leftover pasta dough from an episode of pasta making by the Wong Brothers. The red peppers and squid? They were remnant ingredients I just threw in. Give your leftovers a makeover! On hindsight, it looks almost like instant noodles ðŸ˜‚
