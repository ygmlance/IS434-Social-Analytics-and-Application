Never thought I'll be so happy to receive the package for my printer's toner from Lazada today. Used to be able to get a replacement easily within hours from Challenger or Popular when they were still open. Finally can move on to the next stage of work. Happy and relieved. And yes, most work is digital but some bureaucratic requirements still require prints unfortunately.
