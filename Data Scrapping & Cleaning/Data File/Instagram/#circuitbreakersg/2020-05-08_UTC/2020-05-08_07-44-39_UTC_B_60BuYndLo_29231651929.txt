Some days we do not feel like working out, so when you have those days, make sure you are doing something to keep healthy.

For example, make sure you are getting up regularly and walking around, aim for 250 steps an hour at a mimmim. 
Stretch several times a day. You can hold a series of stretches while doing work on the laptop or watching a TV program.

Drink water. Carry around that water bottle, and if you do not like plain water, throw in some lemon or fruit pieces in there.
