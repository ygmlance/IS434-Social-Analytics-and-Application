Virgin attempt at Banana Bread 🍌🍞 with a googled recipe by Breaddad.com, which has a proud 5.0 🌟 rating by 65 bakers and/or keyboard warriors. Hehe! This recipe is waaaaay simplier than what was stating inside the recipe book (huh, what's golden syrup?) that came complimentary with my Kenwood Bread Machine. With 10 mins to go before baking completes, my dad, mum and myself exclaimed spontaneously from different part of my home, "很香哦～［something smells good］" ☺️⠀
⠀
But trust me, when I first lifted the bread machine lid and saw my banana bread, I was like 🙄. Why didn't it rise? Did the Baking Powder not work too well? I decided that 'Tasting Is Beliving', so I went ahead to slice (and photowhore, of course), before taste-testing my masterpiece to eventually give my verdict. My dad was even quicker, once I tossed out the Banana Bread, he started picking up the chunks stuck to the mixing paddle in the bread pan with chopsticks (don't doubt our chopsticks skills😎) to eat. Immediately, he turned to me and said, "真的沒有很好看 (me: 🙄)... 不過真的很好吃，也很香 (also me: 😏)!"⠀

My dad. 😬⠀

Anyway, I hereby declare that my first homebaked cake (since @f4squalls said Banana Bread is a cake) in Singapore 📣  S U C E S S F U L ! 😋⠀

P.S: I'm not one of those #CircuitBaker okay! 😂
