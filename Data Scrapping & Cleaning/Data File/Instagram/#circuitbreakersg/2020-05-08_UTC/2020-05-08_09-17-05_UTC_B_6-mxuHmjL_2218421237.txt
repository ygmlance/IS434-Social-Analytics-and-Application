Thank you @engineeringgood for your generosity! 3-4% of our students are still supported by Home Learning Packs and they are mostly from lower-income families. Because of this kind donation of 151 preloved laptops, it has contributed greatly to DAS students' online learning journey.

DAS will continue to support our parents and students to the best that we can. We hope week 1 of school holidays has been great for all of you!
