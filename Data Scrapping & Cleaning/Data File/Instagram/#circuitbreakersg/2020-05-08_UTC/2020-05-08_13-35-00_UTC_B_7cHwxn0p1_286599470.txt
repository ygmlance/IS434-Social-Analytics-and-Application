I keep telling my husband that weâ€™re closing the kitchen too early these days at @casamanini, coz now Iâ€™m craving a pizza with my beer at home, and heâ€™s definitely not planning to cook till weâ€™re back at work tomorrow. ðŸ˜ª Youâ€™d think that I get special treatment being his wife, partner, co-worker, slave and some say Boss ??!!?? Rethink that. Please. ðŸ¤£
