Insane! Insane! Insane!
I’m going “kee siao” after a month of CB!

But......
one thing for sure art is a form of therapy to help me de-stress! 
So after 2 nights after my little Carrick went to bed, I worked on the up-cycling project to transform an old low chair 🪑 to a more sophisticated vintage look using Annie Sloan Chalk paint and stencils brushing. The colours I used were Duck Egg Blue, Lem Lem and Provence. 
And these colours match the Jeju House Magnetic Board from @toppingskids and our new home.

Next, I’ll be working on a next piece of furniture and have to thank @bigbluetrunk for sending some paints over!

Just for fun... can you tell that I’m using bedsheet to dress myself at home as part of DIY maternity shoot? It’s once in a lifetime so why not hack it and do out of the norm since I lost my sanity.
