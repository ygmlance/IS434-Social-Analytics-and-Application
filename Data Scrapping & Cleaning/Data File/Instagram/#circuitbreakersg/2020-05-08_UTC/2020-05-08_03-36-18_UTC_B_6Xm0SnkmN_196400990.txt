Breakfast today, was the same as last Friday’s, 1 x telor + 2 x kosong Roti Prata takeaway from Bunga Raya Prata Hut. This time, i did the “banjir”, or flood the curry over the prata, for a different eating experience.  Delicious! 😋 #rotiprata #rotipratakosong #rotipratatelor #rotipratabanjir #tapao #bungkus #bungarayapratahut #sgfood #sgfoodculture #sghawkerfood #sghawkerculture #ourhawkerculture #indianmuslimfood #halalfood #halalfoodsg #supportlocalsg #savefnbsg #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
