DAY 32 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
CHEESE PARATHA

As we step into the second month of the CB today, I treated myself and my boy to cheese parathas for breakfast. 
Those who know me well know my love for cheese. Brought back memories of a friend who we lost to cancer last year. Whenever we went out for a meal with her she would say to everyone ... "Isko dekho ... abhi sabse jyada cheese wala pasta order karegi, aur saath mein diet coke order karegi 🤦‍♀️ yeh ladki bhi na....! " 
I miss you my dear Asha. But I do believe you are in a better place now. 
The inspiration and idea for the parathas however, came from a dear friend @nandinibivalkar  Thanks Rekha, we really enjoyed the parathas. I normally make cheese onion parathas, the regular way, but she made it by stuffing it between two rotis. That way,  you can have more filling in there. The photos show it all.
Guilt gets the better of me sometimes, so made a small one for myself. 
And the weather these days is kind in the mornings, so breakfast in the balcony is becoming a common affair 🤷‍♀️😊
