Day 32 #circuitbreakersg| 7 May 2020
.
I am really loving this season where I don’t have to spend time commuting and there are so many things we can learn online! Stuff that we usually can’t access to. I even had new enquiries for zoom sessions for this season. To which i had to reject, coz i have my family to prioritize. Sadly those peeps didn’t quite understand my predicament and it got me really upset. It doesn’t mean that being hm means i am shaking leg whole day. Anyways, moving on.....

Yesterday, my kids had a full day art marathon for charity. Creating Nagomi art. A Japanese form of art. I needed to work and they ran 2 out of 4 workshops independently. I did not hear any screams and the end product was lovely.. so i reckon all went well. I managed to be done with work and joined them for the last round at 8pm. It was so therapeutic to be jamming with my kids and it rekindled my love to draw and paint. Now even though I say that the circuit breaker brings about many opportunities, i do not have the luxury of time to do it all as well. I crashed with the kids last night. Before midnight. Which is rare. I probably fell asleep before them! So tired! There’s a whole lot to catch up today, but conquer we will 💪🏻
