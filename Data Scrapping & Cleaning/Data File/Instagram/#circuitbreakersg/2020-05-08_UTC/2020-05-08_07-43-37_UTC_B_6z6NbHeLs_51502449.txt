TGIF!!! Risotto alla Pescatora with Blanched Brocollini. Clams, Mussels, Calamari, Shrimp, and Scallops cooked in White Wine, and jus used as a starter broth for the Risotto, with crunchy blanched Brocollini drizzled with EVOO and cracked Himalayan salt. 👌🏻 PS. I deserve a rewarding meal for working hard this week. So much reports and media plans accomplished!! 💪🏻 #risotto #pesce #risottoallapescatora  #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
