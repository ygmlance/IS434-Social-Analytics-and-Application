SURVIVED ONE MONTH OF HBL | Giving ourselves a pat on both our shoulders for surviving WFH and HBL with a preschooler and a toddler (with leap 😂). .
We figured out our tag team routine is “adjusting” quite ok for now. I’ll work the MOTN slot and Gabbie work the early morning slot while he see to the kids and I catch some sleep/nap. Enough of judging as every job nature and family style is different. #CircuitBreakerSG isn’t easy to began with. .
We grumble why preschool have HBL daily, coz we need to juggle work and see to her lessons. However, we are also grateful the efforts and pain the school and teachers put in to get the teachings going so that they will not be lack behind when school reopens. It’s also a good experience for the kids and amusing how they chat through the ZOOM sessions like they are really in class together 😄😄. .
Kudos to Gwynneth for surviving 1 month of HBL and surviving our endless nagging and screamings. 
1 week into the extended #CB! Add oil everyone!! We will get through this together!! 💪🏻💪🏻
