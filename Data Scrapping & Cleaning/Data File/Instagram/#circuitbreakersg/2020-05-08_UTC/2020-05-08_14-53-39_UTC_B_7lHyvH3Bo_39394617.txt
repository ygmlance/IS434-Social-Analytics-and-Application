TGIF! How has your #WFM schedule been this week? Time to relax and chill! To usher in this important weekend to celebrate Mother’s Day, we have just released a new batch of ready made #fabricmask covers in #Etsy. Lots of pretty floral designs to pamper your mum. Check out our bio to shop now for that perfect Mother’s Day gift. All bundles at 10% off retail. They are known to sell out within 48 hours, so be the first to cart them out before someone else does! 😜
