Sunshine after the rain at #bishanpark and the #heron community is basking tall in their home nest trees, even the #waterhen community were out for makan, I saw at least 4 - 5 of them all scurrying away when they saw me. But the squirrel I saw was happy to be near me and posed for me to take its photo. It's a pretty #circuitbreakersg day 32
