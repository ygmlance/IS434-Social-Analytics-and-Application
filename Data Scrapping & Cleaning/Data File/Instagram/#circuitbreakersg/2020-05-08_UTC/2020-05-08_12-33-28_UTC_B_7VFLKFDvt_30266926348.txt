CB DAY 33 -

Adam and Eve

Every Friday is religious teaching for Jo. Each week I'll look for key "stories" from the bible to share with Jo, and try to put in the real world part of it so he learn to relate stories in real life. ðŸ˜‚ In the video he said, "cannot eat apple". Well, his biggest takeaway was actually, LISTEN/OBEDIENCE.

Recently he's been on the defiant side when you ask him to do stuff e.g. Don't put things in your mouth/ come wash your hands/ etc. But today's lesson helped a little.

We colored the tree and pasted printed apples on the tree, while doing so, we counted 10 apples. ðŸ˜Œ
