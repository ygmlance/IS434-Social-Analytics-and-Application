[20.20 May 8: Circuit Breaker Day #32] Something with a good source of amino acids, and glucosamine and chondroitin5 to maintain joint health. Best part of homecooked, generous serving of kuey Kar and mushrooms. The trick to nice noodles is to mix a little shallot oil in and toss in the gravy/ dark soy sauce.

Braised in #NinjaFoodiOP300, 10 mins pressure mode after bringing to boil in saut√© mode.
