#circuitbreakertip 4: THE BEST FRIDGE TEMPERATURE
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Do you know? Bacteria grows most rapidly between 5°C and 60°C. This range is also known as the ‘Temperature Danger Zone’. ⚠️ Putting your food in the fridge slows bacterial growth and prolongs the freshness of food, but that's only if it's set at the right temperature!

As a guideline, the chiller operates best between 0°C and 4°C, and the freezer at -18°C and below.🌡 This is also recommended by the Singapore Food Agency for retail stores when it comes to storage of food!

By keeping your food fresh, any unnecessary waste can be avoided.☝🏼 Go check if your fridge is set to the right temperature, now you’ll have a real excuse to open your fridge 😉
