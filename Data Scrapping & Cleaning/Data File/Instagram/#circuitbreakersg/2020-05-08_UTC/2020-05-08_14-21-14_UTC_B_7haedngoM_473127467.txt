8 MAY 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 32

Day 32 - #circuitbreakersg
🌩
Stormy early morning and it was so cooling! Wish I can sleep in more but had to wake up early for work.
🌸
Had recycling craft activities today and made some flowers and star with straws.
Back to more hands on activities since we are staying in.
