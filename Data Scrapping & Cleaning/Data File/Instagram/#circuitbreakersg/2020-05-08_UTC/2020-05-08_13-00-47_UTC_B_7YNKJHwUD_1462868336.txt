“If you fight for your limitations, you get to keep them.”

The notion of not being restrained by your lack of, that you can earn the right to keep what you fight for, inspires me to never stop trying. Be open in owning your flaws – this simple act of kindness to yourself can change your perspective from “I’m not good enough” to “I can be better”.
