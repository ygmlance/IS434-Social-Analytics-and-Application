⬇RECIPE⠀
⠀
Introducing brainless cooking day! 😜⠀
⠀
Sambal Kangkong (serving size, 3~4 minions or 1 GIANT 😆)⠀
Kangkong - 2pkt / 500g (@greenies.sg )⠀
Instant Sambal Udang Sauce - 1 pkt / 160g (@fvfssg )⠀
Oil (Olive & Sesame) - UP TO YOU!⠀
⠀
Stir fry sauce till you're happy and throw your chopped kangkong in, it's that simple! 😎⠀
⠀
NOTE TO SELF:⠀
Please remember the next time you cook this, the sauce was a little too oily, so my future self, please do something about that! Also, it's not spicy enough, so chopped some chillies in it, thanks! Ohya, you bought this from @fvfssg and the brand is 善緣 (i think), anyways you can just type sambal in search and you'll probably remember it. PLEASE DO A BETTER JOB NEXT TIME! 😈⠀
