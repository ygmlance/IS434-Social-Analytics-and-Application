Boost Energy and focus
Reduce stress and tension 
Improve mood and breathing

When deciding on which essential oil to use, think about how individual oil can enhance your practice. For example, floral scent are soothing and calming, citrus scent are uplifting and energizing and woody scent are grounding.
