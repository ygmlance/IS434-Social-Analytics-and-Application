Had wanted to cook Yong Tau Foo for weeks but my marketing trip didn't happen.  After weeks of delay, I manage to make a trip to the market today! Choose the easy way out, buy the ready stuffed ones.  No time for the mega DIY project.  The only DIY I did was stuffed Tau Kwa & 4 handmade meatballs. The chill & sweet sauce were leftovers from our last Koo Kee YTF Grab lunch.

Braised Yong Tau Foo in Bean Paste Sauce (豆酱焖酿豆腐)
Yong Tau Foo Soup （酿豆腐汤）

又一餐搞定😉
