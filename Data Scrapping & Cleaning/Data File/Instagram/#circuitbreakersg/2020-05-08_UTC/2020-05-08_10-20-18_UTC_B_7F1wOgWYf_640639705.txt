left the house for the first time in weeks (all masked up) to collect cookies from a friend.

it's so rare to see the CTE empty at this time of day. even the electronic highway sign said to #StayHome #StaySafe. it was a different story in the neighbourhood estate though with dozens of people out and about either exercising or just strolling around.

3 more weeks to go till the #circuitbreaker ends.
