Semi Sweet Choc Chip Muffins, reduced sugar version. I use the same recipe as the streusel top blueberry muffin and sub berries with 70% bittersweet choc mixed with 59% semi sweet. Top off muffin with chopped 70% bittersweet choc. Basically this recipe can be used for ANY type of muffin flavour, just add your preferred muffin recipe. Today we did not had an issue with melted berries nor wrongly mixed wet and dry ingredients. Turned out better, nice and tall. .
