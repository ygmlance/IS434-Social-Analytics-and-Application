SHE CAN SPEAK! SHE CAN SPEAK! THERE'S A TINY HUMAN IN THERE!

Ok so it's actually totally unclear whether she's saying "mum" (as in mummy/mama) or "mum" (as in milk/eat) orrrrr if she's just making noises.
.
I think we'll just say she's saying "Mummy". Ha.
.
Also please ignore the disaster zone that is my living room. My already low tidiness standards went through the basement when baby arrived.
