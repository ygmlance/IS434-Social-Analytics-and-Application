Curry chicken, there are many variations of chicken curry: Chinese, Malay, Nyonya and Indian style. Curry chicken with potatoes is the most common chicken curry recipe across worldwide. Everywhere you go where curries are served, you will find this type of chicken curry.
Cooking curry chicken with pre-packed curry paste is the most convenient way, I always mixed two different brands of ready mixed curry pastes, together with additional ingredients are still needed to be mixed in the recipe for a good mouth-watering curry dish!
Shallots, garlic, curry leaves and lemongrass are a must as they provide that deep flavour typical of curries. More shallots will give the curry a denser texture and a heavier body.
Always add extra birds eye chilli (chili padi) for extra kick.
As being allergic to coconut milk, I have replaced it with full cream evaporated milk for a wonderful creamy and slurpy curry sauce.
