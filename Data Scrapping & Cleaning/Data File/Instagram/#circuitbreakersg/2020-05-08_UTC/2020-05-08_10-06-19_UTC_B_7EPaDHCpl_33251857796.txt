Missing your unhealthy dose of McDonald's badly this circuit breaker? Presenting my open-faced spicy chicken taco! A modern take on McSpicy with air-fried spicy chicken karaage + curly fries on the side! The secret to creating the McDonald's experience at home lies in the secret SinSin Garlic Chilli Sauce! 🌶🌶🌶
.
SmartyPence Tip 💡
Did you know that McDonald's iconic garlic chilli sauce is actually from SinSin? Some might remember years ago McDonald's removed their iconic garlic chilli sauce, much to the outrage of its fans! They had to bring it back eventually and each chilli sachet was actually printed w SinSin branding for awhile. With no reopening date in sight, get creative with this delicious sauce at home. One bottle goes a long way! 💯
