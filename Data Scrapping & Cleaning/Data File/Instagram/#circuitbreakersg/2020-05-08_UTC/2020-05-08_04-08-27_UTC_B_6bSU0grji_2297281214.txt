When it's 2am and you can't sleep on day 32 of Singapore's COVID-19 "circuit breaker", you make jam!  Or as @imblueming says, people count sheep!  Not much of a sheep counter, so I whipped out the strawbs and the blueberries and slaved over the stove for a while... The end result is I look like I've murdered someone with the spatula... It's all good, @iamivanlau is still alive and kicking and we have homemade jam! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è

Note to all you fabulous food posters on @instagram: With the support of CapitaLand Hope Foundation, @ascott_ltd is pledging US$200,000 to @savethechildren's global food security and assistance programs for underprivileged kids when you post your homecooked meals on IG with the tag #stayathomewithascott.  So get posting and tagging, awesome foodies! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
