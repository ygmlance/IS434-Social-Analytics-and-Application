Having lunch break from my online lesson. Having #hbl myself, I can see both the good and bad about this. All I can say is that, I prefer to go back to school for classroom learning. Nothing beats having the face to face interactions and support from teacher and fellow mates!

Alright now back to enjoying my cod fillets from @mr.fishmongersg using recipe from @themeatmensg of course. The cod is super fresh and sweet!! Link: https://youtu.be/Mfxl5SClMr4
