Dinner this evening, was something a little more extravagant than usual. I had Steamed Red Garoupa Fillet Teochew Style, and Stir-fried Dou Miao, or Pea Shoots, with a bowl of steamed rice. Tasty and satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #steamedredgaroupa #stirfrieddoumiao #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #stayathome #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
