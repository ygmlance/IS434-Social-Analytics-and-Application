Have been doing meetings and local trainings either behind a white wall or a virtual background hiding the messy room for the longest time.

Today after a meeting I thought that itâ€™s time to make this wall a little more functional and spent the rest of the day slapping on a whiteboard and repurposing a random fake plant.

Yes the plant is removable. Not gonna sleep with dusty leaves in my face.

In other news, thankful that my overseas full day trainings are resuming online and instead of travelling, I get to do more work on my bed.
