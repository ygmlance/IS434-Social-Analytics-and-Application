I make #kimchi off and on. Not the traditional kimchi method. But based on the @thekitchn recipe.

With #circuitbreakersg, I’m missing loads of ingredients so substituted them or omitted. Salted shrimp paste - I used the Vietnamese version I had on hand. Instead of Korean chili flakes I used paprika. I omitted scallions and daikon because I couldn’t get them at that point in time.

Kimchi is a form of lactofermentation and it is great with various dishes and I use it for frying beehoon or rice at times. Have you tried making your own kimchi before?
