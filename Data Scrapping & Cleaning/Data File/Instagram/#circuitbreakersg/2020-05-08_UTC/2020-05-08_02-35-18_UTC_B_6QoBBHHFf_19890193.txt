Running has taken a whole new meaning in the past few weeks; the usual community runs have ceased and running has become an individual quiet journey - A battle between my mind and body.
The struggle is real for me, the constant cheer from running counterparts has always been a strong motivating factor.
I am learning to be more reflective during my runs, appreciating creation and her beauty.

Tis‚Äô the season to spread hearts, love and good cheer to everyone!
