Do you know a talented young piano player who currently lacks access to an acoustic piano due to circuit breaker measures? ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¹ Steinway Gallery Singapore (@steinwaysingapore) has launched the STEINWAY CARES initiative, through which 8 Essex Upright pianos will be loaned to such deserving music students for free. These loans will be given on a first-come-first serve basis and subject to receiving a strong letter of recommendation from a reputable teacher.
