We don’t need a special day to celebrate moms, every day is Mother’s Day, let her know she is still important to you, even after Mother’s Day, surprise her! We want to help you to send the love over, thus we are extending this promotion to 10 May! Order Now!

A heartfelt thank you for the utmost support! This Mother’s Day, we’ve received an overwhelming response for this cake to be delivered to their beloved mum. We are extremely touched by your response! But due to reduced manpower operation, we’ve rejected many orders for 9th since we don’t deliver on 10th, and we feel very sorry about it. Many of you have also accommodated to have the cake deliver on 11 and 12 May instead, cos every day is Mother’s Day. So, order now and we will help you to deliver the LOVE to her even after Mother’s Day! Place your order only thru the online store www.thejellyhearts.com *𝙉𝙊 𝙘𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣/ 𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙙𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙨 𝙖𝙛𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙤𝙧𝙙𝙚𝙧𝙨 𝙗𝙚𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙥𝙡𝙖𝙘𝙚𝙙. 𝙋𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙚 𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙏&𝘾𝙨 𝙗𝙚𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙥𝙡𝙖𝙘𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙤𝙧𝙙𝙚𝙧 𝙤𝙣𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙚.
