Day 32 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (8 May 2020) - #nofilter #lunch #homemade #friedcarrotcake (which is actually made of radish and not carrot); done Singapore style, both 'black' and 'white' versions. Much better than Day 27's version where I had used #leftover HK version of #radishcake ; when I had felt that there were too many ingredients and too many things assaulting the palate all at once. This time, I used plain radish cake, fried with just some diced garlic and preserved radish bits and eggs, with a hint of fish sauce. The 'white' part was super #yummy but the 'black' a tad too salty (choice of sauce being the problem). Still happy with this lunch #treat #stayhomewithascott #stayhomestaysafe everyone! #homecooking
