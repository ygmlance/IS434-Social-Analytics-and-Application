I always have dry eyes and eye doctor advised me to use eye drops daily. The dryness often makes my eyes feel tired. I heard about this popular Rohto Eye Drops Cool in Japan and decided to give it a try. It has a cooling and moisturising effect after application. I love the transparent bottle so I can easily tell itâ€™s finishing and also spot any contamination.

Rohto Eye Drops has 25% off on Shopee throughout May. Check out the link in bio!
