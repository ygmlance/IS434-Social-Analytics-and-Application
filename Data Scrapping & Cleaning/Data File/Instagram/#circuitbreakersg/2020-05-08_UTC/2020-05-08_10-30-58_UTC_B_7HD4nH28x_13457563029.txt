Sometimes, our nature study doesn’t go as planned.
.
So, a few days back, we wanted to learn about plant capillary action using a fallen leaf from our monstera plant. Well, the leaf started withering before our experiment could complete. But I guess, that’s alright.
.
🌿What I saw was a child who enjoyed the process of setting up the experiment, excited over watching the colours fuse and so gently placing the leaf into the bottle like it was the most precious thing. (Swipe ⬅️ to view the video)
.
And when the leaf withered instead of turning purple, she learnt that plants have a lifespan, and that leaves may not always thrive well after they have fallen.
.
🌿It was a beautiful process to observe and a lovely memory to preserve - we got to appreciate nature, learnt about its unpredictability and cultivated a little more love for learning.
.
And if you had seen how 👧🏻 laughed in amusement when she saw the withered leaf, your heart will surely go all fuzzy like mine.
.
🌿 Oh the purity of a child - she lives in the moment, finds delight in little things, and is so hard to disappoint even when life throws lemons her way.
.
🕊 My two beautiful children inspire me, and they often show me the way to truly enjoy life and find joy in the present. Thank you, my darlings.
