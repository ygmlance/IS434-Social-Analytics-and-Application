Day 4 Hols = Day 32 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Power Pull
#7dayabchallenge

Did Hasfit 45 min Tabata Strength training with weights (where they wear their Hasfit clothes and Claudia's in grey), I really appreciate them talking and guiding through their workout especially for first timers as weight/Strength training is not something to play around with. You can get seriously injured. I always enjoy the reminders and encouragement they give. And with the couple demos, you can switch between both moves easily (the harder one or the modified one). Also, into Day 5 of the #blogilates 7 DAY abs Challenge, surprisingly I wasn't in too much pain (maybe numb already), but I did it at a more comfortable pace. My Alt leg lifts, I just start from the floor. I'll gradually lift them up soon.. Meanwhile, everyone please #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy 
TGIF!
