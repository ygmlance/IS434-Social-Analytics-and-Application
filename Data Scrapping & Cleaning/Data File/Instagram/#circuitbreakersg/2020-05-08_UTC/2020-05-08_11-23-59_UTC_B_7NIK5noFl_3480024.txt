[Homecooked] Cir Breaker Day 32 Dinner.
We had the leftover fried mee sua from yesterday, and it was still very delicious. The mee sua did not become mushy and the seafood stayed good. 
I also happened to come across ma ni chye at Sheng Siong yesterday and had to buy it cos I love stir fried ma ni chye with egg. It's not easy to find, so if you come across it, do buy to try. I also poached some Shanghai greens and doused them in oyster sauce. Happy to fill our bellies with more vegetables tonight.

Sharing the ma ni chye recipe as follows.
.
Ingredients:
1 Bunch of Mani Chye (马尼菜) , about 300gm
3 tbsp Cooking Oil
3 Garlic Cloves, finely minced
1 Tsp Chicken Stock Powder
2 Eggs
Half a cup of Water
.
Method:- .
1. Remove all the edible leaves from the mani chye stalks, which should yield about 200g.
2. Discard stems. Rinse and wash leaves, drain well.
3. Sprinkle 1 tbsp of salt on the drained mani chye leaves, mix thoroughly and leave aside for 5mins for the leaves to sweat.
4. Rub the leaves and tear them up. Squeeze dry the juice, rinse and squeeze dry again. Repeat another time.
5. Preheat the frying pan, add 3 tbsp of oil and minced garlic (You really do need that much oil to cook the leaves properly and achieve a good sheen and moisture). Saute till slightly brown then add in the leaves.
6. Stir till the mani chye leaves are wilted, add in chicken stock powder and mix well.
7. Add water and stir till water evaporates then break in the eggs in the middle and stir well through the leaves till cooked.
8. Turn off heat and dish up on serving plate.
