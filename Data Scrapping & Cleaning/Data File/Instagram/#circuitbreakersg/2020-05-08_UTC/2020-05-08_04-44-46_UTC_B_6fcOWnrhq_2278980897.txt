Making sure every part of the bus is sanitize and safe for you and me on the public transport. 
The efforts of all of these essential workers are critical to keeping society functioning, making sure that every one of us is safe, healthy, and has access to all of the resources we need.

But the range of people we’re depending on to keep our economy going during the pandemic, take care of us and our loved ones, and keep us safe is much broader than that.

The reality is that essential workers in the midst of the coronavirus crisis are food workers, social workers, cleaners, retail associates, transit workers, home health aides, and even those who provide support for victims of domestic violence. They’re often not highly paid individuals, and they’re risking their lives. This crisis definitely let us know every little job in here plays a part in the growth and movement of the country.
