#throwback to 2days ago when Ah Por brought dinner over~ Daddy said I need to stand inside the yellow box and I did! Ah Por didn't get to carry me as she stayed in the car, and we only waved and gave each other flying kisses. ⁣

(Mummy: I feel that she's #growingup at an alarming speed! So very #blessed for this #circuitbreaker actually that I'm able to watch her grow ❤️ She conveniently treats my growing stomach as her armrest 😅 Thanks huh #mybabygirl)⁣
