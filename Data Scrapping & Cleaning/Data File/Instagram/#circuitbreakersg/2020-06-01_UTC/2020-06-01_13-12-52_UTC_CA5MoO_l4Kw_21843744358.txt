Calling out to all of you health-conscious ladies! 👸❣️ Hope you've accomplished what you've set out to do during this Circuit Breaker. 😍😍😍 Let me tell you what I've been doing to keep myself healthy in this season:⁠
⁠
💕 I have been trying my very best to avoid piling up the extra calories by working out almost every day. 🧘🏻‍♀️ Yoga, Pilates... and from time to time, I will also follow the IG workouts by @pwflow_ & @sue_fitnessjourney too! 😝⁠
⁠
💕 Eating healthier is an important part of keeping myself fit and fab. With the luxury of #WFH, I have been trying out different meal combinations such as salad 🥗, fish soup 🐟, etc. And occasionally, when I get tired of the meal prep  and cleaning up, it is time to order in 🍽️! @cedelesingapore/ @leanbento/ @wafuken/ @yolofoodsg, anyone? Wholesome and healthy meals... within just a few button clicks! 😜😜😜⁠
⁠
💕 Getting sufficient rest, aiming to sleep 7 - 8 hours every night. With this, I find that my skin is smoother (less pimples, to be specific!)⁠
⁠
💕 Drinking plenty of water - at least 2L a day!⁠
⁠
On top of all these, #didyouknow that there are also health screenings that are specifically tailored to women? 💌 Women are more prone to diseases such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, etc. By undergoing screening tests for these diseases, it can help in early detection and treatment (touch wood!).⁠ 👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️
💘 More info regarding screening test in Bio!
