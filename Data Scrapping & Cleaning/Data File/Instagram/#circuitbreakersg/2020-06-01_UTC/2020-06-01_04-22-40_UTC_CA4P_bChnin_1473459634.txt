My best persons in the whole wide world. 
Who would have thought I got a ‚Äúbreak from work‚Äù for about 2 months granted by the government officials? I am grateful in a way that I get to be a stay at home mum (although I do have work to attend at times), definitely not easy juggling all but it is satisfying indeed. Thank you boys for being my best persons making me tired but happy all the time. ‚ù§Ô∏è Look at that thigh!!! Emre is wearing  #offspringsg thinnest diaper, it‚Äôs amazing especially for hot days #offspringinc @offspringsingapore @offspring.inc #circuitbreakersg 
P/s thank you Kakak @pinky_is_me for the T-shirts ü•∞
