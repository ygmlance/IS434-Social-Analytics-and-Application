Gosh, its 1 June 2020! Are you ready for the next 6 months? 
Anyone has the same feelings that the past six months had been hectic while quiet at the same time? It's like we are all in the garden like the cat, waiting to pounce at the right moment. Imagine the wind rustling the leaves, the insects chirping, birds flying around, while we stood still with busy thoughts on our next move. It has been a challenging first half of 2020. May the coming months be better for all of us. .
