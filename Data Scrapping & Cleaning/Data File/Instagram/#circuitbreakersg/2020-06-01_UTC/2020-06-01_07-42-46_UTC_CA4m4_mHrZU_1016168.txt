#Circuitbreakersg day 55

A labour intensive Saturday left me with aching bones, so much that I felt incapacitated. Thatâ€™s the level of unfitness I am currently at. 
Delivery service for dinner : ðŸ”º KFC chicken and more chickens! 
Sadly, it was very salty. Like the chicken was over-seasoned before the batter was slather over. 
Not surprising, we didnâ€™t finish it. No prize for guessing whatâ€™s for lunch tomorrow.
Maybe itâ€™s a sign not to eat too much fast foodðŸ˜…
