Hello June 2020, saying goodbye to the last day of circuit breaker in Singapore.
The long anticipated ftf interaction with loved ones which is unfortunately non essential, still;
The classification of social work and psychology or psychiatry as non essential in crisis time like this - which then reclassified as essential for You-know-why (yes I’m still sour about the weight mental health wellbeing deserves);
The sudden craving for bubble tea islandwide;
The sudden realisation of healthy lifestyle by crowding Parks like never before;
The sudden urge to buy furniture like IKEA’s gonna close down now;
And the sudden need to hoard a lot lot of toilet paper like no tomorrow.
Look what COVID-19 has cost us all - the freedom we used to take granted for.
Also the lesson learnt: know what’s essential. You and I are not included.
And then the endless contactless mode of everything, the need to wear masks everywhere, the purposeless wandering that warrants summons, and eventually my monthly budget for expenditures these 2 months which miraculously outlived the chronic deficits.
·
I started with a lot of struggles ascertaining uncertainties by being reactive and instructive; 2 months now and I think I’ve grown to like the hybrid model toggling between WFH and WFO/HV 😇
·
I won’t swear that I’ll express love and say what I wanna say whenever and wherever, yet. But I’ll cherish time spent together even more, and I’ll embrace compliments and compliment more generously 🤓
