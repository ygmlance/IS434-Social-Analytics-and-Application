Here’s a quick and cute little circuit to get you working 🔥🏋️‍♀️⁣
⁣
The burpees into pistol squats is such a killer and will get your heart rate fired up 🥵 If you can’t do pistols you can go into a squat straight from a burpee ☺️⁣
⁣
For the tempo sit ups you wanna place one hand on your stomach to make sure you’re engaging and only using your core ✨⁣
