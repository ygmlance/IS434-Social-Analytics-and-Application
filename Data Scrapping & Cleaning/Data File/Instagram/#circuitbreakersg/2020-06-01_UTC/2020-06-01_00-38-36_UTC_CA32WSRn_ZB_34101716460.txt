We only had a couple slices of onion and chives wraps and bread lying around this morning so I decided to quickly whip up some #breakfastquesadilla and #frenchtoast for breakfast..👩🏻‍🍳 In the quesadilla, I added egg and cheese (mix of #cheddar and #mozzarella 🧀) seasoned with tonnes of black pepper and some #mixedherbs. After my previous failed attempt at making French toasts in the #airfryer, I decided to give it another shot. It was definitely a better attempt than the last but I still faced the problem of the bread sticking onto the surface of the airfryer even after I oiled the pan. Maybe I’ll add parchment paper to the bottom next time before placing the French toast in. Bon appetit~☀️ #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
