The wife kept thinking about the lobster porridge she had with her colleagues pre-CB at Wan He Lou. They zoom daily but can only think of previous group meals together. So she ordered this in. They separated the lobster, rice and the delicious broth. If you â€˜scared carboâ€™ then take less or no rice. Have the rice with the broth lah, itâ€™s so comforting! The crispy Thai style fish is so nice too! Halfway through the meal, we decided that eating out of plastic containers is so difficult. How to cut the crispy fish and the vegetables are so difficult to take out from the very deep containers. So we transfer them all to plates and it instantly taste even nicer. ðŸ˜‚
