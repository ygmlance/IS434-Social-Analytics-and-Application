We had #takeaway from another neighbourhood restaurant tonight, @purabrasa.singapore.  Though they have a variety of attractive set menus, we decided to order Ala carte â€” their popular #spanishomelette, tagliatelle all'oglio (very tasty spicy garlic shrimp flavored pasta), and flavorful grilled Iberico pork Secreto ðŸ˜‹

Wow, I must say (maybe it's the CB) â€”  although we have eaten at the restaurant a few times before, the takeaway food was still really awesome. Definitely a repeat order in the future!

They offer a discount if you use whatsapp, but are also on #oddle, @deliveroo_sg, @grabfoodsg and @foodpandasg.
