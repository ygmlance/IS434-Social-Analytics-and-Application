Last day of CB.
.
.
.
From tomorrow onwards Singapore will be exiting circuit breaker and life will gradually resume back to what it was.
But as for me, there isn't much changes.
.
.
.
Travel to Singapore is closed. Mass tourism is not slated to return anytime soon so I guess I will still be stuck at home.
