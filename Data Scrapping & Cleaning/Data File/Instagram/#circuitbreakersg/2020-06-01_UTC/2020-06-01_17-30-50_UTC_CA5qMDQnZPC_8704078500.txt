CB is over and its back to school time! Was encouraged by the school parents should have a “Debrief” with their children to bring closure to the Circuit Breaker experience. So I ask my son what is it like life before, during and after CB. And that’s what he wrote haha. Of course for him he still has 1 more week to countdown. I took a passport photo for his Primary 1 registration last year. I think I did quite a decent job right?
