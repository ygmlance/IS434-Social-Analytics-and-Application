Participating in Community Resilience. Doing my miniscule contribution (yes, the campaign period clocked a total 218m steps!) to support social cohesion and supporting the families in need, managed to register just in time before the end of #circuitbreakersg and participated🚶🏽‍♀️🏃🏼🏃🏽‍♀️in #WeWalkforSG - thanks @baeyyamkeng for sharing the reminder.

#WeWalkforSG is also a fundraising campaign for 2 charities: Child at Street 11 which provides early-years education to children from underprivileged families, and Brahm Centre which cares for the mental health of needy and vulnerable elderly. Donation to either or both charities can be make at https://wefor.sg/charity/. .
