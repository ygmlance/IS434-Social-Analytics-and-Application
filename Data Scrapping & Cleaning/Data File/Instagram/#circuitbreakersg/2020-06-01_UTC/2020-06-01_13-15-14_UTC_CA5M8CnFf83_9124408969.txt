For the children to be able to focus, their brain needed enough rest and also trained to be focus.

Staying away from gadget really helps, but i found that the best way is to engage in activity as a family! Of coz parents will also need to sacrifice their gadget time.

So some of our fave are board games, baking together, making home made playdoh, play outdoor, conversation with parents, grandparents, etc. 
These blends from Young Living essential oils can help their bright mind to focus more:

5 Frankincense + 5 Cedarwood +5 Vetiver + v6 in a 10 ml roller bottle

OR

just use GENEYUS from kidscent series. üòç

Rub in the back of their neck in the morning, can be before school, when they do homework or other activities
