Day 56: Yes! ❗️❗️❗️This is the last day of Circuit Breaker. 🥳🥳🥳 For the pass 8 weeks, I have spent most of my time staying at home, I might just went out for about 10 times. I spent most of my time cooking, making fabric mask and making makeup tips to post in IG. Surprisingly I only watch 2 K-drama and 2-J-drama. And I read 4 books in 2 months. 😁😁😁 I used to be a person who need to leave home at least once a day, otherwise I will get headache😨😨. And now I can stay home most of the time! But,I still preferred to go out more. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Makeup service is not allowed in Post- circuit breaker, I really hope that by the end of June I can start my Makeup course and my bride’s wedding will not be affected.❤️ This is why I stay home and not even go out for exercise. I wish the virus🦠 will go away ASAP and we can continue our lives as normal. 🙂
