Hello June 💕
.
Halfway through 2020, adjusting to a new norm and if there’s anything to be thankful for this #circuitbreakerSG restful period, it’s gotta be having Chriselle taking up a sense of responsibility in helping out with our household chores 🧹 🧼 daily (even if it’s juz for 2mins 😆 ) Now here’s a well-deserved tea party reward for a true princess! 💫 👸🏻 .
.
Embracing a new normal home partying 🎉 alone but not lonely. Kept apart, but closely knit at heart. Our hearts are full and tummy filled as our home constantly brims with lotsa loving delish treats 💕🧁🍰🍪🍧from our beloved @wendiixken @vivien_tan @pandajoyce @angiejoop @pandavaleris @mamasinfinitylove @audt @venaamorisvii @kailingtiffyx @vinvola @jingle_belle_ @sugar73 @fj.mama @thehappypig Grateful for all the love during this #stayhomesg period! 💕 🏡
