Matcha Monday and welcoming June with matcha chiffon cake, filled with whipped houjicha ganache and fresh strawberries! 🍵🍓
✨
Love how strong the matcha and houjicha notes are! I think I’m too generous with the tea powders as they’re so intense till astringent, but the teaholic in me doesn’t mind that at all 😂. The unadulterated matcha and houjicha aroma is 💯!
✨
Glad I finally got down to making my own ganache. Luckily it’s successful! White chocolate from my all time favourite @valrhona_asia. And yes quite little whipped ganache cos it’s always cake > cream for me due to the milky taste in creams, but somehow I like the addition of a little cream to make the cake more enjoyable overall! 🍰
✨
Used the tea powders from @matchayasg. After trying quite a number of matcha powders locally, I still prefer theirs as they yield better flavour and results IMO. 💚

Swipe ⬅️ to see another of my creation - condensed milk chiffon cake with whipped houjicha ganache! Condensed milk and houjicha actually go pretty well together. Even the non milk lover me find it quite nice. Made this for Mum which I ended up stealing a few slices! 🙊

So which side (flavour) are you on? 🍵🥛
