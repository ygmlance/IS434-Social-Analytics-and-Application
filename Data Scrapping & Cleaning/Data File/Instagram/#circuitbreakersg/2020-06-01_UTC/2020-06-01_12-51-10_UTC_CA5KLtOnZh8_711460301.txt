ü§≤üèªG I V E A W A Yü§≤üèª BioShield is an organic and natural vitamin-based anti-bacterial spray and it is our latest essential, especially for Sophie. It is suitable for all skin types and can also be used on newborns too. Offers 4 hours of protection and is non-toxic.

While we can't wait for the Circuit Breaker to be lifted, we need all the protection and essentials ready and stocked! 
And I mean stock, not hoard!

I've been following closely and reading up to understand and learn more about this pandemic. Instead of being paranoid and worried, let‚Äôs channel our focus on protecting our family through prevention and good hygiene practices.

BioShield protects us from germs, bacteria and common viruses (including HFMD, H1N1) even before we get exposed to them. Protection is definitely better than cure!

We are using BioShield Kiddie on Sophie and BioShield Flex (for kids 10 years & above) for myself and the family.

Together with @bigbigmummybrownies, we are giving away a bottle of 60ml BioShield of your choice to 3 lucky winners. Can be either BioShield Kiddie or Flex!

To participate in this giveaway:
1) Follow @bigbigmummybrownies and @_mrschia_
2) Share with us a good hygiene practice to keep our family safe!
3) Tag your friends (One tag per comment)
4)Increased chances of winning when you post it on your IG story and tag @bigbigmummybrownies &  @_mrschia_ so we can track your posting.

Giveaway ends on 07 Jun 2020.
