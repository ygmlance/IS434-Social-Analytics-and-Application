Schools will resume starting tomorrow (2nd June), marking Phase 1 as we exit Circuit Breaker and enter into safe reopening period. We look forward to be able to resume our classes soon (hopefully) with all of you! 🙏🙂 #sgunited #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #staysafe #moeschools #broadricksecondaryschool #ministryofeducationsingapore #automotiveeducation
