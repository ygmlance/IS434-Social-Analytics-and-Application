Apr 7th to Jun 1st. These 56 days of Singapore Circuit Breaker measures has been challenging to us all. We have all persevered, and even discovered something new about ourselves.

As we come to the end of the last day, the skies decided to reward us with an awesome sunset + double rainbows!

Great job everybody! As we start reopening tomorrow, pls continue practicing good personal hygiene and habits. We will get to the full reopening very soon
