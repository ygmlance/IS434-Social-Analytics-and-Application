No Place Like Home With My Bro 👨‍❤️‍👨
.
Simple spray paint project by Matty to commemorate the last two months he spent together happily with Christian, using our fave Spray Color from @toppingskids . In a flash, the Circuit Breaker is coming to an end and Matty will be back in school tomorrow onwards, so many mixed feelings about it. .
.
While we adults all probably lamented once or twice (or many times) during the CB, actually I think the kids were very happy for this unique experience of spending lots of time with the family and with each other. Never once did Matty complain of boredom (and no I am not one of the super mamas who had a different sensory activity for him every day with the wonderful smell of a delectable dish coming out from the kitchen 😆) and CEO looks for kor kor the instant he wakes up every morning.
.
Am praying for a smooth transition as the wheels of society start grooving again, kind of already missing the noisy sounds in the house every day. But onwards we do need to move, so yes we shall do this, and I will keep the last two months as a precious part of my memory bank! Hope all of your kids who are going back to school tomorrow will adjust well back to school life despite the different measures that everyone has to adhere to now 💪
