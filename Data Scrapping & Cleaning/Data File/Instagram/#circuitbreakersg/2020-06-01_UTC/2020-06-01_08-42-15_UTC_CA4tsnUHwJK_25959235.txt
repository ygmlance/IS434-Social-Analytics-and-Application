[GIVEAWAY!!] CLOSED
.
The circuit breaker period has probably been a daily test of patience for all of us mummies 😂 But I'm sure that there's no one else we would rather be stuck with than our little ones.

Though CB ends today, we will still find ourselves spending more time at home for safety reasons, so I'm sure all of us are constantly looking for new toys or activities for our kids. 
This is why I'm excited to gift one of you a set of 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐁𝐮𝐬𝐲 𝐂𝐮𝐛𝐞 & 𝐕𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞 𝐑𝐨𝐥𝐥 𝐀𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐓𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 (worth $45) from @playfulltribe!

This has been really helpful to keep my ah bui busy when my hands are tied up with kor kor 😅

All you have to do is:
.

🧸 Comment below and let me know your favorite memory with your little ones during these past two months

And that's it! The contest will close on 7th June 2020, 2359hrs and I'll be picking a winner the next day. (Valid for Singapore residents only) Good luck!
