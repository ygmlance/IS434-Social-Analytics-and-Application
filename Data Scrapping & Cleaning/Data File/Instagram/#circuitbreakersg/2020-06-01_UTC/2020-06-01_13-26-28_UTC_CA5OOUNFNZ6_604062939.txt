Happy Birthday to my dearest husband ðŸ’• You have been an awesome friend, partner, confidant and advisor. Really happy to be spending time with you and family with a game, lots of food, and laughter despite physically separated in this season. I hope you enjoyed all of my surprises ðŸ˜˜ #nonstopeating
