        "text": "I think we can all agree that appliance repair can seem like a daunting task. Additionally, it may be tempting to try and save money by troubleshooting appliance problems ourselves instead of calling a professional for help. Appliance malfunctions can range from small, easily fixable solutions to large, life-threatening issues. Here are five signs that I should call an appliance repairman for help.\n1.\u00a0I See Smoke or Smell Something Burning\nCommon sense tells us that an appliance emitting smoke is malfunctioning and in need of professional help.\u00a0 Turning off or unplugging the appliance is not enough and can be a fire hazard in the future. An appliance repairman can help me diagnose the source of the smoke. Additionally, do not hesitate to call 995 in an emergency.\n2.\u00a0My Utility Bills are High\nExpensive utility or electricity bills often indicate my appliance(s) may have to put in extra work to get the job done. Dryers with broken heating elements and leaking air conditioners are two common culprits causing my electric bills to skyrocket. \n3.\u00a0My Appliance is Making a New Sound Repeatedly\nSome appliances, such as washing machines and dishwashers can be naturally noisy. However, unexpected grinding or hissing noises can indicate malfunctioning parts of common appliances. Sounds should be investigated immediately to avoid broken parts, massive leaks, and overworked fans or heating/cooling elements.\n4.\u00a0Excess Moisture Builds Up Around my Appliance\nMoisture presence promotes mold growth on a wide range of surfaces, including walls, floors, and both inside and outside of appliances. Moisture can pool up near the bottom of leaking appliances, such as washing machines, refrigerators, and A/C units. Additionally, moisture can appear on walls and crevices in humid rooms due to lack of air flow.\u00a0 If I suspect excess moisture buildup, an appliance repairman can help me diagnose the source of moisture and troubleshoot a plan to dry out.\n5.\u00a0My Appliance is Wobbly or Shifting Unexpectedly\nA wobbly appliance is often a sign of being off-balance or a broken part impacting the rotation.  @saladsashimiq @sweety_pie1231 @wafflespiesallthingsnice",

This results in tossing my appliance out every time something goes wrong. Going this route can be expensive and harmful to the environment. Not to mention, it takes up my precious time.

Others, not so much.\u00a0If a problem is particularly severe and I am not sure how to repair it, consider using a professional home repair service right away. I acct quickly to minimize further damage.\u00a0Once I\u2019ve discovered a problem, it\u2019s important to be timely in my response to the issue. My response should be based on my assessment of the problem. For example, if I find a slow leak in a water supply line, I place a bucket under the leak site to catch any water. This can help prevent water damage to the building. However, a larger leak might be too much to handle with a bucket. In this case, I\u2019ll want to shut off the water supply to the leaky pipe as soon as possible. Find the isolation valve controlling water to that pipe and turn it off.\u00a0Once I\u2019ve mitigated the immediate problem, I take some time to study the issue and get specific advice.\nThere are times I need a set helping hands.\u00a0Some plumbing fixes work best when I have a second person helping you. For example, my kitchen sink have a drain and an overflow. These connected drains reduce the efficiency of a plunger\u2014I plunge the drain, and the air simply comes out the other drain or overflow rather than breaking up the clog. Having a family member to cap the other drain while I plunge the first helps keep the air trapped in the line so the pressure buildup can clear the clog. Also, a second pair of hands and eyes can be useful for improving safety in general. ***If a home emergency is especially difficult or dangerous to fix,\u00a0seek professional help. Professionals have the training and experience to handle most plumbing emergencies while minimizing risks.***\n@missprinqueen @chill_nov_1 @saladsashimiq",

I am learning to be creative. During the circuit breaker, I\u00a0watched step-by-step repair tutorial videos, conferred with friends, borrowed tools from a neighbor contactless and did it myself over the course of several weeks.\u00a0I think it\u2019s good that now I have more of a knowledge of repair work and Circuit Breaker gives me a chance to do that.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, home maintenance falls on a spectrum of difficulty.\u00a0I do understand that most plumbing and electrical work, for example, is best left to the professionals.\u00a0One mistake can cause a lot more damage. If I\u00a0don\u2019t know how to snake a pipe or a garbage disposal, it might leak overnight. In a multi-unit complex, that can get expensive. Because it leaks into the unit below or the unit next door and then it becomes a huge thing.\u00a0Besides property damage, there\u2019s potential damage I could do to myself, e.g. garbage disposals as one source of danger.\nSo now that circuit breaker is over and the condition in SG is more stabilized, I will be calling the experts to help with more serious problems.\n@missprinqueen @chill_nov_1 @wafflespiesallthingsnice",

        "text": "\ud83d\udcae Answer Portion #1: When I noticed a leak under my bathroom sink in mid-April, I tied it up with an old T-shirt and stuffed junk mail under it. I\u2019d normally call my landlord to take care of it, but government instructions are clear: stay inside and away from others to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\nPlumbers, electricians and handymen and -women are considered essential workers during the COVID-19 crisis. They\u2019ve continued to come to the rescue when a pipe bursts or the electricity goes haywire. It\u2019s frequently hazardous work, pandemic notwithstanding.\nI am thinking: What\u2019s the sense of me not going out if I have somebody who\u2019s going out to multiple houses coming to my house? That defeats the purpose. Is it\u00a0life or death, or life and discomfort? If the washing machine won\u2019t wash or the screen door won\u2019t seamlessly slide, does it make sense to call a professional? Does bringing in a worker\u2014or several\u2014put my safety and theirs at risk? Do I try doing it myself? Is fixing a sink as easy as baking bread?\nWhen should I call a professional? If it\u2019s an emergency or serious issue, I will make the call. Some repairs simply can\u2019t be put off. An untreated electrical shortage could spark a fire. A leaky pipe in one apartment could cause thousands of dollars of water damage in the entire complex. In those situations, I consider it\u2019s necessary to bring in a trained professional, ideally before a situation grows dire.\nIf it\u2019s less urgent, I shall weigh the risks.\nIf I am with my family of five and my washing machine breaks, it might not be feasible to transition to a washboard. But I\u00a0don\u2019t want home-repair workers in my unit. On the flip side, some maintenance workers are hesitant to put themselves at unnecessary risk. The latter makes it trickier to find someone to tackle a job immediately and increases the turnaround time for some repairs.\u00a0It\u2019s not a good time for maintenance unless it\u2019s a serious issue.",

For example, if there is fire in a room or throughout the house, I have to leave the house immediately and then call 995.\u00a0An unnecessary 995 call could prevent someone who is truly in danger from getting help so I only call when essential.\n2. Practice / role-play\nFamiliarize with possible emergency situations to help reduce panic or anxiety in case of a real emergency.\nFor example, I create a game with scenarios for my family to test their knowledge. Adapt scenarios accordingly to explore more possible scenarios. Practice several times a year so that we are as prepared as possible to deal with emergencies.\nBelow are some scenarios I have used before to train my children as they are the ones I worry most in the case of an emergency.\nScenario #1: Call an expert\nYou're playing in the living room when you hear a loud noise from the kitchen. You go to see what's happening and see mom on the floor. What should you do? (Check to see if mom can hear me.)\nMom answers you, then tries to get up but can't. She is bleeding a lot. Should you call 995? (Yes, I have to call 995 and ask for an ambulance.)\nWhat do you have to tell 995? (The Emergency is at XXX My mom fell down, she can still talk but she's bleeding a lot and can't get up. I am calling from This is also where we live.)\nCan you wait for the ambulance with your mom? (Yes. I'm not in any danger.)\nScenario #2 : Call an expert\nYou come home from school and see that the door to your house is broken, and you think someone you don't know may be inside. What should you do? (Go to my neighbours' house or use a mobile to call 995.)\nYou come home from school and see that the door to your house is broken, and you think someone you don't know may be inside. What should you tell 995? (Location of the emergency is XXX. Someone I don't know broke down the door to my house and might be inside. I need the police.

I appreciate Tan because he is always quick to diagnose the problem that needed the most repair as well as his 24x7 readiness and skills and he charges me a reasonable fee for each visit. The result is I\u2019m a happy customer who do not have time and of course I do not know how to fix them.

For example: \"My 73-year-old mother-in-law has been having difficulty breathing for the past 30 minutes.\u201d I quickly state my oved one\u2019s medical history.

Photocopy important documents (such as current and past medical records and test results) so that I can give emergency personnel this information while keeping the originals.\nI always stay calm as much as possible in any home emergency as if I panic, the kids will panic even more. I keep my voice even to stay calmer and also help people around me stay calm.

The lesson: Be it call experts or DIY repair, I always make sure I don't try to save any treasures until all the family and I are safe. Home emergencies can happen at any moment, often when we least expect them. I have stored the numbers of varipus experts for various kinds of emergencies in each family member's phone just in case. I have been constantly l doing preparation work to learn the DIY skills since it takes time before the experts can arrive so while they are on the way, I will do the DIY part for urgent cases. E.g. A fire. Not all fire extinguishers are the same. There are 3 basic classes so I make sure I have units classified ABC in my house meaning they fight all types of fire. I would certainly try to put out the fire while the experts are on the way only if I am sure I can still get out if my efforts fail.\u00a0@chl5701@movieslover101\u00a0@sweety_pie1231",

From natural disasters, power loss, appliance failure and no water, emergency repairs tend to be one of the most important repairs for me to be comfortable and confident with. In most cases, I will find the repairs are DIY or fixable with whatever is around the house. Common repairs would be fixing a leak, broken window, flooding, frozen pipes or clogged toilet. Each problem can have a relatively simple fix, a leaky roof and broken window can be patched, flood can be pumped out, pipes can be thawed and repaired and toilets can be unclogged with a chemical. For the most part, emergency repairs are not permanent. They are what I can do fast to stop the problem then have a professional come in to permanently fix it. When I am worrking overseas, flooding as a result of frozen pipes, clogged toilets or a leaky roof can result in very costly\u00a0water damage\u00a0repairs and even potential health issues resulting from\u00a0mold growth\u00a0if not addressed in a timely manner. Hence I am a DIY first, call expert second type of person. @hasmiley321 @keilymissy @lcyhne",

Search online for videos and instructions for DIY fix. Call up friends for guidance.\n3. Decide to DIY or call for experts based on judgement and research information above.\n4. DIY if I can manage. If it doesn\u2019t fix the problem, I will call experts.\n5. Call up experts straightaway for issues related to electrical and gas appliances and ceiling matter.\n\nIf it is a clogged sink, I will first use a plunger. If it does not work, I will use the boiling water method, baking soda and vinegar method to clear the clog. If it fails, I will call the plumber.\n\nFor dripping tap, I will cut off the water supply, remove the tap head, wrap plumber's tape to tighten the joint from the inside and seal coupling joints tighter together to prevent further leakage. If dripping still persists, call plumber.\n\nFor small, shallow holes or cracks in the walls, I will patch it up with filters myself. If the holes and cracks are long, deep or growing I will call experts immediately as it could meant structural issue with the house.\n\nFor replacement of door knob, I will also DIY as it is not too complicated.\n\nMeanwhile, I will sheer clear of any repair work related to holes in ceiling, gas or electrical appliances. Leave it to the experts, as it could be easy to open up the appliances but put them back could be a nightmare. Not to mention the risk of getting hit on the head from crumbs hailed down from the ceiling, injuries or death from gas leakage, electric shock from these appliances due to improper repair work.\nFB: Adela Chew @ruyidianxin  @sugarplumteatree @nuitabol",

Below are some of the projects I have completed over the past four years\u2026\nInstalled brand new shower in the bathrooms.\nRe-finshed\u00a0all of the kitchen cabinets.\nRepainted the entire house.\nRe-landscaped and de-weeded overgrown backyards.\nInstalled closet systems.\nInstalled new interior doors.\nRepainted the front door.\nRepaired the gutter.\nInstalled new light fixtures in the entire house.\nPatched large drywall holes.\nFixed a leak in the laundry room.\nSometimes I have had to hire\u00a0a handyman or specialized vendor aka \"EXPERTS\" to do the work on our houses. Here are just a few\u2026\nFixed up the entire interior of a foreclosure.\nFireplace inspected and panels replaced.\nMolding installed in a bathroom.\nReplaced two\u00a0garage doors.\nInstalled molding and a closet system.\nRepaired the garage disposal.\nSo the key to\u00a0determining whether to do my home emergency project DIY or when to call an expert, is\u00a0to determine what works best for me financially, skill-wise, and time-wise. I have hired out many times simply because I ran out of time and not because I couldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0The key for me has been to be reasonable\u00a0on my expectations and price of the materials. Then I make sure that I will still have a significant profit on the cost of the project versus hiring it out. I personally have no desire to do all this work only for me to get as much money back into the house as I put into it.\u00a0For example: I recently fixed my bathroom and it\u00a0cost $3,000 for the materials. Even though we had to spend $800 on new tools, the labor was $4,000 for a basic shower. We were able to install\u00a0a much nicer one. We ended up making over $3,000 in\u00a0savings.\u00a0\n@wintersnowy1 @lcyhne @keilymissy",

And it\u2019s a fact that is not necessarily gender-related.\nI found out over the course of my marriage that I, the wife, am generally better at building and fixing things than my husband. If he has to fix something, it often leads to frustration on his part (feels he should be able to, but doesn\u2019t know how) and he gets into a bad mood. I, on the other hand, love to put furniture together, and even like researching how to fix something and then fix it. I have ordered parts online for two washing machines, a dryer, and a dishwasher - and completed the repairs successfully. I figured out how to fix a floor problem downstairs, I remodeled some rooms, even doing demo work, and I\u2019ve painted. I like the sense of accomplishment I get from fixing this stuff. This last week, I fixed the gutters, which had been drooping in a couple of places.\nMy husband still does some things around the house: he likes pruning the trees and large bushes, and sweeping the walkways, and taking out the garbage, and he likes washing pots and pans.\nFigure out which one of you is best at fixing things. If it\u2019s truly neither of you, then look into finding a reliable handyman.\n@lcyhne @wintersnowy1 @enxinneverending",

Double-down on those things and appreciate those attributes.\nMy father was a building code enforcer and master at carpentry. I inherited none of that skill. When my mother would suggest that my father an I spend some time together in the workshop at home you could almost hear the groan from both of us - my father who almost certainly didn\u2019t want me involved and myself who knew I\u2019d be fairly incompetent and a disappointment.\nBut guess what I did end up good at? Numbers, patterns in numbers, and getting deeply into niche topics like company fundamentals and regulatory compliance. I went to school for economics. I have always been paid well and I am good with \u201cmoney things\u201d as my wife calls it.\nOh, she certainly makes fun of me, yes. Her father was an engineer and she is good at putting things together, fixing things, etc. I subscribe to what I call the Ricardian household management. I am good at making money doing strategy and analysis. Some other person is good at fixing shit. So, I hire that guy. It\u2019s more efficient. Fortunately for us, it is very clear that I have the financial/business skills.\nThe moment the washing machine or anything makes a noise, my line is, \u201cI think we need to call the guy\u201d. My wife is like, \u201clet me take a look\u201d. Have fun, just don\u2019t expect me to take a look. It\u2019s a running joke in our house.\n@cnyhappy1 @silentxdisco @p1314168",

Fixing a Clogged Garbage Disposal\nThe verdict:\u00a0Try to DIY it.\nA clogged disposal may be cleared by using a small specialty wrench that fits into a hexagonal opening on the underside of the disposal while the disposal is turned off.\u00a0 I will call a professional if this method doesn\u2019t clear the stoppage.\n6\u00a0Replacing a Door\nThe verdict:\u00a0Hire a pro.\nWhile\u00a0a new door\u00a0can help brighten up a space and cut down on heating and cooling costs, these savings are best spent on making sure the installation job is done right. Any major door overhaul should be handled by a professional. For example, turning my two windows into an opening for beautiful French or sliding glass doors",

        "text": "@cnyhappy1 @jacksonivyp @p1314168 1\nFixing a Leaky Kitchen or Bathroom Pipe\nThe verdict:\u00a0Try to DIY it.\nA DIY fix for a drain pipe may be simply tightening a slip-nut near the P-Trap. If the leak is directly from a hole in the drain pipe, a DIY fix would be a flexible coupling with hose clamps. If the leak is from a drain pipe inside the wall, I will consider calling a professional.\n2\nHanging Wallpaper\nThe verdict:\u00a0Hire a pro.\nThe challenge with hanging wallpaper is getting it straight on the wall and matching up the patterns correctly. It typically requires two people to do the job. Sometimes bubbling can happen, which means a strip of paper will need to be removed and a new strip reinstalled. This can result in not having enough wallpaper and needing to order more. While only I can decide whether the DIY savings outweigh potential risks, hiring a professional guarantees a smooth and predictable outcome.\n3\nPainting the Exterior of My Home\nThe verdict:\u00a0Hire a pro.\nPainting the exterior of a house is a big job. Most homes require all of the trim, soffits, and rake boards and, depending on the type of home, all of the siding as well. This requires extensive use of ladders at high levels and sometimes climbing up on the roof. I will need to consider safety requirements before tackling an exterior job.\u00a0\n4\nRemoving Popcorn Ceilings\nThe verdict:\u00a0Hire a pro.\nRemoving popcorn ceilings is gaining in popularity lately, but is an extremely messy job. First, the popcorn must be sprayed and softened by a softening agent. Then, all of the surface area must be scraped with a blade. While scraping, it is impossible not to create divots and holes on the surface. Those divots and holes need repair with compound that will need to dry and then be sanded smooth. Finally, everything needs to be primed and then painted with two coats of paint. The work is overhead and requires ladders. For a job like this, I will hire a professional and save myself the headache and probably less-than-desired results.",

That way, I\u2019ll avoid damage from power surges when the juice returns to my home. I take great care using candles for illumination, exercising proper fire safety, and be sure to stock up on batteries and flashlights \n2.\u00a0\u00a0Getting locked out of the house is a little embarrassing, and,that time I had to call a locksmith, which was mightily expensive.\u00a0\ud83d\ude31 \u00a0Keeping a hidden key poses\u00a0security risks. So I now remove my extra key from inside the hide-a-key garden stone or from under the back porch door mat, and consider leaving it with my trusted friend or neighbor instead.\n3. Kitchen fire is the most scary one I have experienced!\u00a0\u00a0First, I don\u2019t panic. I keep a box of baking soda in a handy spot for dousing flare-ups in a toaster or stovetop pan. I also avoid tossing water\u00a0on the blaze, and don\u2019t try to smother the flames with a dishtowel or anything that could catch fire. The better course of action is to use a pot lid to extinguish the flames. If it\u2019s an oven fire, I don\u2019t open the door\u2014close the oven and the fire should extinguish itself. Although some fire extinguishers are rated to extinguish grease fires, those handheld fire fighters can spread flames rather than extinguish them when used improperly. As such, I went to those free RC courses and educate myself\u00a0on the types of extinguishers and how to use them so I am always ready in case of a disaster.\n@p1314168 @jacksonivyp @silentxdisco",

But during the current lockdown I have learnt to DIY many stuff on my own while watching and learning how to do it from YouTube!! My heater switch 'broke' few days ago, something fell out from behind the switch and I couldn't flip it over to turn it on because it got stuck!! It was also past midnight and I was 'freaking out', decided to Google for solutions and I followed the video on how to remove the switch with a screwdriver! Felt so proud of myself after the DIY, great sense of achievement \ud83d\udcaa so now if you ask me again what I would do if something goes wrong at home, I think I will Google and try to DIY first before ushering in the experts!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a @meinkyungkim @juju_jyn @jennierubyjane",

Even better? I probably have the tools needed\u2014such as a plunger, wrench, and screwdriver\u2014at home already.\nScratched & Creaky Floorboards\nNo matter how lightly I tread, there will be unexpected wear and tear on my floorboards. But I\u00a0don't\u00a0need to call an expert to fix it for me.\nLevel 2:\u00a0\nElectrical issues.\u00a0Problems like breaker trips, electrical buzzing and humming, and flickering lights when the system kicks on are all signs of a electrical issues. These can be really dangerous, so I will be calling an emergency furnace service if after restarting the electrical system or changing the light bulbs the problems still exist. \nLevel 3:\nGas odors in the home.\u00a0A gas leak is\u00a0never\u00a0something to fiddle around with. If I smell gas from my gas system, I will definitely be calling an emergency team right away.",
