A different birthday this year for YP (on the right) where we had to plan out what to do at home to make the birthday celebration less boring since we’re still under CB period.

We baked our own carrot cake which turned out second to the best carrot cake we’ve ever had (Best one we had was in NZ last year) and had plant-based meal from elemen. 
Simple and nothing fancy but we had quality time together this birthday/CB period and manage to not bite each other’s head off living together for the past two months!

Happy birthday my love though you’re just next to me 💕
