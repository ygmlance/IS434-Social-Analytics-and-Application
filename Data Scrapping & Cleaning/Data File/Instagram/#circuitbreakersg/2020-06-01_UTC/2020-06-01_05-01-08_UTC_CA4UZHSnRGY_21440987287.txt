Repurposing chicken essence bottles for blending of essential oils for @nakedbar soaps. It was a therapeutic few hours, removing the labels with baking soda and oil off its optimum that I had kept for this purpose. And putting proper labels to make the processes more efficient when I can restart soapmaking again in Phase II.⁠
.⁠
It was a rare opportunity to pause because of the #circuitbreaker.⁠
.⁠
On a regular day before, my head was always full, trying to get inspirations and ideas to make new soaps. The "itch" to create something new, make something better, try out a new technique keeps me on a 'high' all the time.⁠
.⁠
Every day is a mad rush trying to secure new ingredients, test out new recipes, fulfil orders on top of running after the kids to make sure they are in the right place at the right time. So it's often only in the quiet of the night around midnight, when I can start to measure out oils for making soaps the next day.⁠
.⁠
To be honest, measuring out oils is actually the most stressful part of the whole soap making process for me. Cos it takes precision and focus when multiple oils are required, to make sure nothing goes wrong that could spoil a whole batch. Soon everyday became a blur.⁠
.⁠
So in a way, this pause was good.
.⁠
The creative energy went into cooking and baking new food for the family, while the excess bandwidth was redirected to repurpose / upcycle materials I have so I can be more efficient when the action starts again in Phase II.⁠
.⁠
Many will restart a more regular life tomorrow as Phase I kicks in. While I patiently wait for Phase II, I'm taking time to appreciate this bonus time that I got to slow down.⁠
