Day 56 Circuit Breaker Meals: Took a quick breakfast before my Zoom meeting. Then after meeting, went back to sleep. Woke up, fried Char Kway Teow for Lunch & then went back to sleep again. Woke up, prepare a simple Tahu Goreng meal and throw in 2 Fried TauPok. Today, eat and sleep only cause weather good for sleeping. Also, trying to catch up my lost sleep. What a way to spend the last day of the Circuit Breaker! #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
