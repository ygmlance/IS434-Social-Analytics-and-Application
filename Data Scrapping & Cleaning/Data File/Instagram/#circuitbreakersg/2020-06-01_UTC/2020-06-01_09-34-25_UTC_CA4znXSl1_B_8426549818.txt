The news this week has been especially bad, especially with the BLM movement being discussed in Singapore. Add social media to the mix and it means we’re exposed to current events more and more often, sometimes with little control. We need to know when to switch off all access to the news and to focus that energy somewhere positive. ⁣

This should absolutely not be an excuse to not pay attention, especially when racial issues in Singapore have entered into the limelight once again. But the goal is to find the balance between being educated on developing situations while not becoming totally overwhelmed by it. ⁣

Most of the time that means compartmentalising that grief and dealing with it in a different time. Scheduling a ‘worry time’ during the day to process news might be a good way to help your body and mind process information in a healthy way. ⁣

You are 𝘯𝘰𝘵 a bad person for wanting to take a break and recuperate from global and local affairs. It is essential to know what’s going on, but that absolutely does not mean subjecting yourself to terrible stories 24/7. ⁣

Take a break, and then come back ♥️
