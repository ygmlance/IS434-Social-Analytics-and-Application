31/05/20 | CB Day 55 - Revision on -at word family using dot stickers. Prepped this the night before and pinned it on his board. When he saw it in the morning, he took it down and can’t wait to work on it. I’m guessing it’s the dot stickers that attracted him. He is now able to spell and blend these words confidently. Well done baby 👏
