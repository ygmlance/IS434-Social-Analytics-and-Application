For the boy who does not fancy writing on paper, these are a few ways which i have done during the #circuitbreakersg for his #homebasedlearning .

His work is mainly on recognising the alphabets and numbers in english and chinese.

📝Instead of using paper for writing, we wrote on #daiso sand, used #playdough to form words and erase words from chalkboard.
📝 I dino-lized 🦖🦕everything he had to learn 😂 Eg. “let’s write b for brachiosaurus. And the T-rex goes down down down d!”
📝 He loves fish 🐠! So he joined in jiejie’s HBL on parts of a fish in chinese and remember them till now haha.
📝 He loves 🚗🚙🏎 so we did counting in chinese with his huge collection of cars.

It was tiring, yet very rewarding, thinking of ways to engage this boy. I am glad school is starting soon 😆
