The Carnivore returned to camp tonight so dinner included his request for... Salted Egg Fried Chicken!
.
Fortunately I received some Salted Egg powder from #emaku. This was an easy to prepare, full flavoured Salted Egg powder 👍He’s requesting for Salted Egg Crabs now!
.
Tau You Bak (Braised Pork in Soya Sauce) made with #kwongwohhing premium Black Soya Sauce & premium Light Soya Sauce, I’m still saying is the best soya sauce ever. Added Tau Kwa (beancurd) and Eggs. Perfect. Leftovers for porridge tomorrow 😃
.
Fried Kang Kong with Garlic, dried Shrimps and seasoned with #kwhsignaturesauces Light Soya Sauce
.
Finally, Mini-me’s request for Fried Chicken marinated with #KWHsaltedbeanpaste, chinese wine and pepper.
.
Tomorrow sees Mini-me returning to school. I think she has mixed feelings. She’s been studying so well on her own and working real hard, I hope she can continue this newfound determination in class too.

Though the #circuitbreakersg is slowly being lifted, we must continue to be vigilant.
