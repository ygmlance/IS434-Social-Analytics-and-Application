Beat the lockdown depression and Monday blues @nativebarsg  cocktaik. Foragersâ€™ Garden is a matcha gin, blue pea flowers, calamansi and matcha kombucha mix. The taste is very unique, bitter and vinegary because of the Kombucha (which may be overpowering the other flavors). They have also a few other premixed cocktails delivered straight to your home. #blaastplaces #blaastplacessingapore 
Thank you @julianr93 for the gin treat.
