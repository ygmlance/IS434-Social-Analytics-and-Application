💚🍚Cilantro Lime Rice to the rescue because plain rice can be boring sometimes!🍚💚⁣
⁣
Made this to go with our Mexican night dinner and gotta say I was thoroughly impressed at how flavorful the rice was! No more plain boring rice as the lime really adds that kick to it 👍🏻⁣

Ingredients:⁣
Cooked Rice⁣
Cilantro, finely chopped⁣
Lime zest⁣
Lime juice⁣
Butter ⁣
⁣
Mix everything together with the cooked rice. You can swipe left to check out the video on how I made this. The amount of ingredients( lime, cilantro, etc) you use is based on how much rice you’re cooking. You can just add a little and taste along the way to ensure you get the desired taste. Reduce the lime if you like it less sour. This rice goes great with BURRITOS!!⁣
