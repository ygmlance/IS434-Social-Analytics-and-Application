last circuit breaker meal and we’ve decided to go korean after watching 2 months of kdrama non stop🤪 
on today’s menu are homemade korean fried chicken two ways - soy garlic and the spicy version, galbi (korean bbq short ribs), and a not so pretty korean seafood pancake cuz we ran out of spring onions😅 
here’s marking the end of circuit breaker and hopefully things will improve quickly from now onwards🙏🏻 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #lastday #sgfood #sgfoodies #koreanfood #koreanfriedchicken #soygarlic #gochujang #galbi #beef #seafoodpancake #kdramainspired #eatathome #homecooked #stayhome #staysafe #stayhealthy
