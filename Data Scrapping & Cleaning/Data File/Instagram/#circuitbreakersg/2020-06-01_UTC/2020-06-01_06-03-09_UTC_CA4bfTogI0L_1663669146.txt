BY THE SEA (BTS)‚Å£ (DM TO ORDER)
The gold represents the sand, and has a soft, subtle shimmer to it. I also added texture to make it slightly more realistic! Meanwhile, for the sea, I mixed a variety of blues, creating a marble effect to better capture the depth and movement of the waves. Pls swipe for close-ups of each piece & I hope u like this combination! üíô‚Å£
