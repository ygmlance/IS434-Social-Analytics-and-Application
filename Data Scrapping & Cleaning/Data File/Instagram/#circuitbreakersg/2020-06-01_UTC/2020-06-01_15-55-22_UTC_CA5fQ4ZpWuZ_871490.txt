Today is the first day after SG’s Circuit Breaker. Singapore will gradually re-open economic activities. Kids will start to go back to school. Hope everything will back to normal soon. 
Also, today marks the second half of 2020. Sometimes i can’t help to think months of my life have been taken out but i realised because of this quarantine I discovered skills i never thought i would be able to do. • Painted my boys’ rooms + walls in  different parts of our house. • Installed LED Lights directly from the main line. • Unclogged a sink drain. • Baked for the first time. 
You deserve a beer Dave!🍻😀
