It subtlety reminded me that change is the only constant in life. Just like how we used to take what we have for granted until covid19 came about and altered the way we live our lives. Instead of lamenting on how the situation has brought inconveniences to our daily lives, we should look at how much we have grown especially in innovating new ways to communicate, new approaches in doing business and new manners of celebrating important dates!
