To all parents who have survived through the arduous cycle of ‘Eat, Nag, Work, Nag, Eat, Sleep’ during this period, hats off to all of you! 
Phase 1 is starting tomorrow, and so is the opening of kindergartens in Singapore. For the K1 and K2 parents, congratulations! However, Covid-19 is still in play, and hygiene practices taught this period shouldn’t be thrown out of the window. We’ve compiled some tips to better prepare your K1 and K2 kids for the start of school tomorrow.

- Practice washing hands with them
- Prepare hand sanitizer, extra masks and thermometer
- Re-emphasize do’s and don’ts of hygiene: sit 1 metre away from friends, don't touch your face, wash hands before and after meals, try to not touch each other’s faces or masks

We hope this would help your child have an easier transition back to kindergarten. For the other young ones, fret not! It’ll be their turn next week, and we’ll be posting more information then. Stay tuned!
