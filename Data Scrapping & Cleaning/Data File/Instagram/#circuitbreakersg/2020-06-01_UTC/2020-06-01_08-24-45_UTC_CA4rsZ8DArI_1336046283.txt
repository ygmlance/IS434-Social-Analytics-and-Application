We are looking forward to welcoming our four legged customers from June 2!🐶✂️ We only have a few slots left for the month of June, do contact us to make an appointment.

We would like to seek your understanding to follow our precautionary measures to keep everyone safe: ✔️Mandatory for all customers to wear a mask at all times when in the store.
✔️Use ‘SafeEntry’ to check in & check out.
✔️Temperature taking will be enforced.
✔️Observe at least 1m safe distancing at all times.
✔️Contactless payment methods are preferred: We accept PayNow, PayLah & Bank transfer. However, Cash & NETS are still accepted.

Our retail store is still open! So pls feel free to come into the store to get what you need! We appreciate your support!

Take care & stay safe🐾

Warm wishes,
The Suds & Scissors Team
