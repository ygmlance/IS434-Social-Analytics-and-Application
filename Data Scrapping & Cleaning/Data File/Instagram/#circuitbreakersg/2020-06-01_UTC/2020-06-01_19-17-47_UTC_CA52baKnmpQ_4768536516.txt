This marks the end of CB and we official entered into Phase 1 Safe Reopening. Ayden aka 弟弟 have also completed his 100 days on planet earth! No doubt we can’t do a celebration 🍾 for his 1 month as well as his 100 days with friends and family, we still managed a small cake cutting affair with our little family of 4! (With a cake baked by Daddy Sam and M! )👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🎂弟弟 also have millions of Singaporeans rejoicing with him over the gradual returning of the country back to a new normal. 弟弟, I pray that you will always be a happy and brave baby. Stay strong and healthy my little one as we weather this storm together as a family. Mummy, Daddy and 姐姐M love you loads!! ❤️😘#happy100thbirthday #infantlife #sgbaby #familylove #familylife #sgfamily #circuitbreakersg #safereopening #celebration #SMEAdentures #homebakedcake @thatunclesam @thatagentm
