Day 54. End of circuit breaker days. Woke up at 3 am for a drink and snapped a pic of the beautifully beaming moon. Sunrise is fabulous. Had to attend three e-meetings for work prep. Managed to make some lemon madeleines for Missy in between the break. Nom has put on significant weight and he look just like a loaf of bread. Sunset is gold. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #viewfromhome #mybunnyathome #instadaily
