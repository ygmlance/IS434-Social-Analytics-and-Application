We are finally at the "end" of #circuitbreakersg ⁣
⁣
So let's par-TEA🎉 🤣⁣
⁣
While flying and visiting tea leaves farms seems to be far away from us still... you can get your hands on the Vitantonio TWISTEA and TWISTEA Plus. ⁣
⁣
Exclusive to cotemaison.sg currently, the #vitantoniotwistea twist and lock mechanism allows you to separate the water from the tea leaves so you get the perfect brew every time. ⁣
⁣
We love how it's both a teapot and a tea cup at the same time, brew and drink straight from the #TWISTEA 🍵⁣
⁣
As retail stores remain closed during phase 1, you can continue to shop for our products online. Also remember to wear your masks when you head out so you avoid fines and penal-TEA😉⁣
⁣
Have a great week ahead! ⁣
