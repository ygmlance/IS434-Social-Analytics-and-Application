My neighbourhood mama shop is amazing. It has everything and I mean EVERYTHING which you usually cannot imagine a small store like this could have.
Their latest new offering is kulfi, the traditional Indian ice cream straight from India. I don't usually like sweet things but the clay cup and metal spoon that came with it were so cute.
