Today marks the last day of Circuit Breaker in Singapore. And Its also the last day of operation for my Home R&D Kitchen. Tomorrow all the kitchen equipment are moving back to SLICE. The feeling was bittersweet while I was packing all the equipment if you ask me. Initially at the beginning of Circuit Breaker I was really struggling with the fact that we have to work from home. And on top that with all singaporean s panic-buying that give me anxiety. Getting ingredients for my R&D was my first world problem. I guest everyone else were also like me trying to adapt to the Circuit Breaker. Next was isolation. I know we occasionally zoomed each other and texted everyday but the void is there. I did when into depression fo a bit.  Gradually I learn to adapt to the " new normal " Once again my sprite was lifted and I was inspired once again. I was really inspired after binge watching a Netflix Docu-series "Chef's Table". Watching "Chef's Table" was like therapy to me. It sort of my source of inspiration. That inspiration drive me to try out all the amazing dishes,dessert and snacks which most it I have never try making it. The biggest milestone was to conquer my fear of working with the oven. The hidden blessings of Circuit Breaker is that it has changed determination and motivation of gaining more knowledge so that I  could be not just an excellent Chef but also a knowledgeable one too. #CircuitBreakerSG #SingaporeTogether #StrongerAsOneSg  #covid19 #2020
