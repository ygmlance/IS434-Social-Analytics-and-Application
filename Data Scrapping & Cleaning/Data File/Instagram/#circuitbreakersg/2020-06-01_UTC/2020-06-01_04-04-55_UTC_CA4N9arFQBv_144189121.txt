The "circuit breaker" is coming to a close, but the fight against this pandemic goes on. As we try to get back to our lives in phases, let us not forget to be socially responsible, courteous towards each other, not xenophobic, grateful to our frontline workers for their service and be generous and mindful to those who are greatly affected by this pandemic.

Together, we re-build to become a stronger Singapore.

On the side note, Mandarin Oriental Singapore had a really cool heart on display to show encouragement!
