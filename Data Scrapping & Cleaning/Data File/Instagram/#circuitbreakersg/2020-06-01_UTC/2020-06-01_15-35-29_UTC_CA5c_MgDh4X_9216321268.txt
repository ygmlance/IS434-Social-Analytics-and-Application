The last sunset of Singapore's circuit breaker lockdown! 
A new month of trying to adjust to the "new normal" will happen, and perhaps we may see restrictions being lifted more and more.
Looking forward to so many things!
Meanwhile, grateful for the quiet moments, honest conversations with myself, things that give sparkle to life and friendships fortified online.
Thankful for the kind words received, the time taken to chat and the energy shared.
