Happy 1st Quarantine Barkday Charo! I can’t believe you’ve turned 1! It felt like yesterday when I brought you home for fostering. No adventure today but that’s okay because everyday is an adventure with you! A beautiful rainbow cake just for you because you filled our lives with loads of colour! Mama loves you! ❤️ #birthday #quarantine #quarantinebirthday #circuitbreakersg #barkday #dogsofinstagram #lifeofpets #dogsofsingapore #party #pawty #pawtastic #singapawrean #one #year #old #treat #celebrate #love #mongrelsofinstagram #buzzfeedanimals #cake #dogcake #cakefordogs #singaporespecial #singaporespecialsofinstagram
