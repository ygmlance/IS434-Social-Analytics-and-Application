~ Chilli-less Crab Pasta ~ It's the last day of the Circuit Breaker. We can finally get the "crab" out of the house! (Pun intended). Jokes aside, we successfully spent 56 days in "lockdown" and established routines which will be the new norm. So I find it befitting today to cook a classic Singapore fusion dish - Chilli crab pasta. A popular dish with locals and tourists alike, chilli crab was one of the dish which I missed in Montreal. As lobster was in abundance there, I always cook chilli lobster instead. Lol. No one says "No" to crab pasta, chilli or chilli-less. The Simlets can't tell the difference visually! Another achievement unlocked. Congratulations to all in Singapore. Hopefully we can move to phase 2 soon. Majulah Singapura. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecooking #healthykidsfood #instafood #chillicrabpasta #pasta #fusionfood #singaporeanfood #mymontrealstory #sgmummy #sgmummyblogger #sahm #circuitbreakersg #majulahsingapura #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
