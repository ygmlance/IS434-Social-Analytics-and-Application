...and just like that, after 8 weeks of #circuitbreakersg, we enter a new phase today where I will head back to school for lessons with additional gear (face mask, face shield, sanitizer) while gearing up to prep my students for life with COVID and exams. The past 8 weeks have been a wild ride, of good days, bad days, days of missed celebrations, new conversations, tantrums... but all full of memories constantly and consistently filled with the presence of these 2. And for that I am grateful.
