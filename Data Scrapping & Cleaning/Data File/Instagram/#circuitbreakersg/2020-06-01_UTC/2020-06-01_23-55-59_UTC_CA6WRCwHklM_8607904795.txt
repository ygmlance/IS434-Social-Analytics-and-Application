Bye bye CB 👋👋, hello Phase 1! 🖐
.
Today marks the first day of Phase 1 (Safe Opening) after 56 days of Circuit Breaker in Singapore. So what does it mean to us? A new norm has emerged in our daily life... wearing of mask 😷 (not face shield unless you are one if the 4 groups allowed 😎) and keeping a safe distance 👫. But we still cannot get into the pool 🏊‍♂️🏊‍♀️ as yet until Phase 2, so just hang on there 😀
.
Continue to stay safe and stay healthy 💪👍
