celebrated “circuit break her” with @theprofessionalcollective barre people this morning. what a way to ‘close’ this time of intimate physical isolation & stress free dancings in the hall. thanks @shan.delvecchio for taking time out to share with vast choices of music every week that keeps us amped. #CbACTIVE #balletbarre #upsidedownworld #circuitbreakersg #nofilter
