Hot Chocolate.. coz I seriously miss the ones at Paris! A good cuppa hot chocolate is thick, rich in chocolate flavour.. topped with melting marshmallows..... but of course I had to go the extra mile by adding a drizzle of nutella & some Callebaut mini pearls... and todayâ€™s cooling weather ...its just PURRRFECT! ðŸ˜‰
