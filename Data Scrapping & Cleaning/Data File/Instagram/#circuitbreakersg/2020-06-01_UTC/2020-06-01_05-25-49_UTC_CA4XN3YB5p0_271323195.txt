easy and yummmmy afternoon snack edition. Turn the instant prata you have in the freezer & a can of tuna from the pantry and create a (healthier!) tuna puff pastry puff. - - and the possibilities for the fillings? Endless. Cheese, mushrooms, chicken sausage, curry potatoes + chicken / minced beef, salmon, spinach, this list goes on. Just be sure to cook your fillings first! - - 
Have a great Monday, and yay to surviving CB (I assume we are all now more in touch with our kitchen skills, right?) and entering phase 1, staying safe and adhering to the measures in place ðŸ’• slowly, but surely alright? - -
