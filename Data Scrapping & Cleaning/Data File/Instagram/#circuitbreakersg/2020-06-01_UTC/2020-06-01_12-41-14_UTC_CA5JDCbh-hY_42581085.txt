Last day of circuit breaker, something we hope will never need to happen again in Singapore. What have all of you achieve during this circuit breaker period? I have gone through more than 50 online courses, both for work and for my personal purposes. Let’s pray for brighter days to come in Phase 1. 🙏🏻💪🏻😊 #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #lastdayofcircuitbreaker #selfie #meitu #sgunited
