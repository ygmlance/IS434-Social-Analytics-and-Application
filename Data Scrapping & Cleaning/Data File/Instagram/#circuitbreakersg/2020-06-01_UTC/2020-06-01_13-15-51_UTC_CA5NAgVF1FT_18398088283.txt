👩‍🍳MUNCH AT HOME👩‍🍳
It’s always exciting to build a dish from scratch!! We started working on this 🍜ramen🍜a few days ahead, prepping the ramen eggs and letting it soak up all the marinate. We then worked on the chashu, broth and prepped the garnishes. It was hard to recreate that authentic japanese flavour especially so for the broth. We also made some gyoza, our must have side dish with ramen🥟Trying out this new dumpling wrapping method for the first time and glad it came out looking great! Nonetheless, we were really happy with how the whole dish came together- plating and taste wise😍
