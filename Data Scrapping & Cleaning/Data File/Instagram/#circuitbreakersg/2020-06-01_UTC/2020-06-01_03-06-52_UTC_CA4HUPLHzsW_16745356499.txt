A new month brings a new theme and EQ Benefits is celebrating Wellness in the month of June 2020. With the transition into the Safe Re-Opening phase, many are still encouraged to work from home and adapt to a new normal when returning to work. It is important to take some time to understand & prepare both physically & mentally. EQ Benefits is proud to present 3 preparedness webinars regarding COVID-19 & your health plus 3 online fitness classes a week in the month of June 2020.
