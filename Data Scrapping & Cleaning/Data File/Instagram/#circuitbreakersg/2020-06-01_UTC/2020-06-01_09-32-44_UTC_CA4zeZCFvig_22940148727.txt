☝🏻We’re all probably guilty of this in one way or another. While we try to stay safe indoors, we also build new habits around our lifestyle in this new normal. Unknowingly, distractions may slowly become addiction and get better of us. If we’re not careful, what is actually good can turn into a poor habit - only to be woken up by the smacking of our phone on our face, or not. 😴😂
