#CircuitBreakerSg Day 56! Celebrate ðŸŽ‰ the last day of CB with Korean BBQ! Perfect meal for todayâ€™s cool weather! Thank you @brandcellar for sending over the newly launch DIY meal sets from @angliss_home_services! We enjoyed the delicious marinated Duroc pork collar so much with the famed parasite noodle and keeping some of the vegetables for next meal! So yummy! ðŸ˜‹
