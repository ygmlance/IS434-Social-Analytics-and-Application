CB or not, these $3 cookies have only 1 intention: to give you the endorphins you need to get through another day. They are black and chewy with a surprise center, inspired by the best cookie weâ€™ve ever had in Amsterdam. Hoping we will all get to travel again soon ðŸ’š. Also, as of midnight today, we only have slots for Saturday, Sunday and the next week. Introductory rates end this week, but take our word for it that prices will still remain highly reasonable and probably at least 20% cheaper than our counterparts.  DM to enquire/ place an order & feel free to have them sent to friends returning to the office. They may need it ðŸ¤¤.
