🍋🍰My final bake before returning back to work tmr🥺... no more baking adventures for the time being (till next hols?)... today’s cakes are specially baked for my dear bff mummies who have been asking for my most successful lemon cake and I’ve waited till the last day of CB to make!😃😃
.
But after eating a slice of it, I feel like making more again... maybe for my breakfast at work next time!😜
