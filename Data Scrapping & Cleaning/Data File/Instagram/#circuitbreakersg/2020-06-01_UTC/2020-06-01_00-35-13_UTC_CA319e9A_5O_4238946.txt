#mondaymood .
1st June and exactly 6mths since my fall. Feeling a bit of #mondayblues this morning as I looked at the atrophy on my operated right leg. Even after returning to my runs and strengthening work to get back some gains, the #recovery ahead is still gonna take a while. Gonna head back to @rehabprosg to have a reassessment with @weeheng_physio finally, after the lifting of the #circuitbreakersg . Looks like more single leg strengthening work going forward. Posting this as a reminder to self of the work Iâ€™ll have to continue putting in to get back to action. .
