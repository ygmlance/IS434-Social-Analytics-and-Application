REMINDER ANNOUNCEMENT(1/2): Here’s our new normal, check it out.

1. We’re moving from using plastics to all our takeout containers being biodegrade, compostable or at the very least, made with sustainably sourced materials.
2. We will cease using PET bottles for our Sangrias and will move onto our own ‘made-with-eco-friendly-sourced-materials’ that are actual jugs with handles. 
3. We have taken our first shipment of 300+ customised paella pans that come direct from our manufacturer, so that everyone can continue enjoying our paellas and fideuàs in-pan without the frequent pan-runs.
4. Within the next 10-14 days take delivery of our own customised wooden paella spoons, just like in Spain, and made from sustainably-sourced wood.
