Last day of CB - who’s ready? ✌🏼 The Circuit Breaker has been many things, but one thing it hasn’t been for us is boring. New challenges, new adventures, new ways of surviving and existing. My kids have driven me mad these two months, but strangely, they’ve also kept me sane. 🤪 Anyway things won’t change much for us till June 8 when A and B go back to school physically. This week will be a week of HBL, trying to glue Bren’s butt to the chair during HBL, trying not to let Amber’s HBL to take over our lives, stress snacking on my part and probably a lot of wine (for me). What’s your Phase 1 looking like? Stay strong everyone! 💪🏼
