Final day of #circuitbreaker. What does that mean for you? ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
At ves, our studio remain closed as we continue to wait patiently until Phase 1 is over. This means our classes and open user sessions will continue to be put on hold until further notice. *Fingers crossed* we can resume things by next month 🤞🏻🤞🏻. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In the meantime, we are keeping our heads up and working hard on a new collection as well as planning for courses for you guys! We are thankful for the enquiries from some of you, and we appreciate your enthusiasm for our courses. 🥰🙌🏻⁣⁣
⁣⁣
While we are really missing human interaction and liveliness in the studio, we continue to be optimistic and look forward to a better half of 2020. Yes, half a year is almost gone but we can still make the best of the next. 👌🏻💯⁣⁣
