Despite the depressing situation in the world facing the world pandemic, I was invited by Geylang Serai CC and I'm happy to catch up with my friend @you_yi aka renowned TV host! ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç .
No doubt the pandemic is nothing near over, and it seems like a depressing long battle for it. I am happy to be able to share my experiences and stories collected around the world, from my years of traveling, which may help us fight the battle for the long run; mentally, emotionally, physically, and psychologically! ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç .
Some highlights covered in this interview were:
