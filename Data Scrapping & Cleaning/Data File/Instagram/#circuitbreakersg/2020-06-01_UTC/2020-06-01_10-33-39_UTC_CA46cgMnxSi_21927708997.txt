I cannot remember a time in my life that books are not a big part of. I’ve always been a bookworm and would often spend my school holidays curled up in bed reading a Sweet Valley book or one by Paulo Coelho during my tweens. I remember spending 3 days with very little sleep trying to finish the latest Harry Potter books. When my boys were born, I struggled to find time to read. In between taking care of a toddler and changing a baby’s diaper, I don’t have the luxury of time to pick up a book and get lost in it. But now that my kids don’t need me as much, I’ve managed to finish two books in a week. Two beautiful stories written by women. Not in this picture is Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng. Both are stories you would want to be a part of. .
I’m hoping I can cultivate the same love of books in my children. Reading helped me improve my written and conversational skills. It also widened my vocabulary and stimulated my imagination. Start them young, right?
Do you have any other books to recommend?
