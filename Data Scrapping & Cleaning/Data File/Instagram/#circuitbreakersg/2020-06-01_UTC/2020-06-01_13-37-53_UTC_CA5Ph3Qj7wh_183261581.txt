#circuitbreakersg day 56!
end of week 8 and end of #circuitbreaker2020🙏

While out for evening walk with furry kid, observed that the sunsetting  sky was beautiful and deep down I was hoping to catch a rainbow. Then towards the last 5 mins of our stroll, a beautiful rainbow arch suddenly appeared but its view was obstructed (see pic no 3) My furry kid and I literally ran towards home to try to capture its beauty before it slowly faded away 😂
Hmm today is end of circuitbreaker and tomorrow dawns a new normal. Hopefully a rainbow 🌈tonight really brings hope and promise, blessings 🙏from above for all of us #sgunited 🇸🇬🙏💪💓
