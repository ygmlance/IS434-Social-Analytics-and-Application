No difference whether theres CB or no CB! #Whattoeat or #whatto cook prevails😅

Had healthy bits for lunch... avo, greens, parma ham and thousand gold’s focaccia bread. Dinner was light too... shredded chicken thigh soup, dark soya sauce braised pork (balance of sauce from last week’s soya sauce chic) and stir fried cabbage with dried prawns😍
