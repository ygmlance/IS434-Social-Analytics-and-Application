june 2nd; one step closer to flying again! yay!
(hence, the #throwback vaycay photo 🌚✈️🌎) i don’t think we will be quite ready for this new norm like how we felt extremely uneasy with our circuit breaker in the beginning. but guys, we rocked it!!! so let’s embrace this new norm hygienically so we never have to revisit CB ever again. stay safe, everyone!

also, i think june 2nd should be a PH from next year onwards because hello, independence day! 🥳😂 #circuitbreakersg #covid19 #newnormal
