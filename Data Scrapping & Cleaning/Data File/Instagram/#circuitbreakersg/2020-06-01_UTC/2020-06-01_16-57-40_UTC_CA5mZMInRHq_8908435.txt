Day 56 Circuit Breaker. Sweet and juicy cod. Cooked this under 10min with teriyaki sauce. Microwave defrost. Pour a tablespoon of teriyaki sauce over the cod, microwave cook for 3min. (Stop every 1min to release heat. Scoop up some sauce and pour over the fish again to prevent it from drying. Continue to cook for another min. Repeat.)
