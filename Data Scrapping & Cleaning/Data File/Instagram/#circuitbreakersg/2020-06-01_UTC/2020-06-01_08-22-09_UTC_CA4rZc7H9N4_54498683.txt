After 8 weeks of steaming, stewing and frying, it’s finally time for dessert to mark the end of the #CircuitBreaker and ease into “the new normal” back in the office tomorrow. 
Made without a recipe but from memory and from what my heart remembers the texture of the cream cheese should be like or what the espresso mix should smell like. The best kind of desserts are the ones made from the 🤎...and that contain alcohol, of course.
