I have a craving for 台式碗粿(Taiwanese Steam Rice Cake). 🇹🇼 So I decided to make it to satisfy my craving. I like the one that I ate at Tainan so I try to replicate it as close as possible. 
This rice cake is prepared and served in a bowl. The kueh toppings are minced pork, radish and braised egg. I have drizzled the garlicky soya sauce on it. 
I’m eating the 碗粿 with a smile as today is the last day of our circuit breaker. May we continue to stay safe and protected.
