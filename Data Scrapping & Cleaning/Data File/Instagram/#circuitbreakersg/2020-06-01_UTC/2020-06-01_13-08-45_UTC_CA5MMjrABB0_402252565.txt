The last hours of SG circuit breaker 👍🏻 Are you excited? Though things are still going to stay more or less the same, especially for work and many businesses, at least this is the little progress in the overall situation here in SG, not big but we shall celebrate this little achievement, right 💕Tomorrow some of the kiddos are heading back to school, believe most of them are more than excited to return to their group of friends and school life. Here’s wishing all the little ones and the teachers safe & well ❤️

Look forward to the day when our lives resume somehow normal again. There is always rainbow 🌈 after storm 😃
