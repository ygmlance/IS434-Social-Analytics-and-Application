Sunday was a beautiful day, so took the boys to the nearby park for a nature walk to scoot and cycle. 🛴🚲☀️🌿😊
.
It’s amazing what a bit of outdoor, fresh air together with warm, lovely sunshine can do for you. In the past 58 days of CB measures, you can really see what a difference it has made to nature.. birds are flying more freely in the sky, boldly going into swimming pools to take a dive with some rarer species which we hardly get to see coming out too!
.
The grass and fields in the park are currently filled with overgrown weeds which needs trimming and scattered leaves that needs sweeping but hey, that’s what real nature is supposed to be all about isn’t it?
.
Nonetheless, looking forward to the day when we can have a covid-safe society where little kids are free to roam out to play without worrying about if they have forgotten to wear masks, where people are free to mingle and sit down together at restaurants and coffee shops to enjoy lovely a meal or have a nice hot cuppa, teh, teh peng, teh siew dai, kopi-O, ice milo and not having to worry about social distancing. ❤️❤️
.
One can always dream and wish, can’t we? 😉
