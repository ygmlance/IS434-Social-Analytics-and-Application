A fitting end to Day 56/56
.
Looking back, I have enjoyed the CB days, perhaps a little too much. I got to wake up naturally, watched shows I normally would not watch and just laze around the house without the nagging.
.
With majority of the shops closed, it felt great not to go out and spend unnecessary money on stuff that I don't really need. This is something I want to continue after reopening.
. 
But good times never last and bad times don't too. Now we wait for Phase 2, where we will start work proper and have dine in again (bubble tea!) .
