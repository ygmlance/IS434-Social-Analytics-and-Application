🎥 there is a short clip on how I prepare our scrambled egg
- whisk 1 egg with 1 tbsp of milk and pinch of salt
- heat up a non-stick skillet, add in 5-10g butter follow buy the beaten egg
- using a chopstick or spatula swirl the egg mixture
- once it begins to firm up remove skillet from heat as egg will continue to cook on remaining heat
