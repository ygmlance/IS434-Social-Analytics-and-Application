5 more hours to go before Circuit Breaker ends! Let us know how you are feeling right now!

We are feeling positive about it as this is a sign that the situation in SG is improving. However, as CB ends, the fight against the pandemic will go on. Coming tomorrow, don't forget to wear your masks, keep your social distancing, stay hygienic and stay safe!😷👍
