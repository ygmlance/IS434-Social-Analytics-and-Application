Congratulations Singapore, we made it through Circuit Breaker 🎊 A quick update for everyone here: we will be entering Phase 1 (Safe Opening) tomorrow! Economic activities that do not pose a high risk of infection will be resumed, along with healthcare services and the re-opening of preschools. However, only leaving home for essential activities and wearing masks should be continued. For more details, remember to check reliable news sources — stay informed, not discouraged! Let’s do our part 💪🏻
