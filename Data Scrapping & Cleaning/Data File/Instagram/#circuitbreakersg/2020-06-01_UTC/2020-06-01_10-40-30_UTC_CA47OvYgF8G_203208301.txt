We're indeed living in an age of unprecedented times...
Remember how i hated April, and i dont even know how May passed, it's now June I'm practising how to wear shoes, how to walk as quickly, how to live the new norm. I'm starting work phase 2 tho.
This CB is coming to an end, we're slowly opening up, there are many families who have been affected, and it's going to take a long while for everyone's lives to be back to normal, just be nice, be kind, and have empathy.
