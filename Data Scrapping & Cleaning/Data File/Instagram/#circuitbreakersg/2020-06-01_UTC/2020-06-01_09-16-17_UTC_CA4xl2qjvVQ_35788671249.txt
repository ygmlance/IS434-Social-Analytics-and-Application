Last day of the school holidays! I have definitely learned much these few months. With the help of my mum, I made fried sweet potato balls! They taste really good and are very simple and fun to make ðŸ˜„ I had so much fun mashing the sweet potatoes, moulding them into different shapes and deep frying them. Swipe to see the final result! Definitely doing this again when I have time ðŸ™ƒ
.
Ingredients:
1. 500g steamed sweet potatoes
2. 150g flour (a mixture of tapioca flour and flour can be used)
3. 50ml milk (adjust accordingly based on softness of sweet potatoes)
4. 70g sugar/ honey to taste
.
Steps: 
1. Mash the sweet potatoes with a fork
2. Add flour and mikk to the sweet potato alternately and in small smounts each time. Mix
3. When the mixture starts to have some shape, knead it.
4. Roll the sweet potato to balls (or to any preferred shape) and deep fry them in oil until golden brown. 
5. Take the balls out and let cool
6. Enjoy!!
