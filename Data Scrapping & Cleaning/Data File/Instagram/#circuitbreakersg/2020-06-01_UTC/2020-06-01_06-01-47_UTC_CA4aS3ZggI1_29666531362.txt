Monthly review in May
I had nvr expected that i could achieve 100k in a month.
Those ppl who has a habit of running 100k might not find it hard tho, but for me it was a tough. After running I feel good but everytime before running, I'd become lazy and ask myself why am I going to run? Last month I had knee pain and I couldn't run much and I had tried to treat my knee by doing some workout and trying LongSlowDistance to rebuild my running muscles. & it finally works! Now I don't have any issue when I'm running and feel much better. In June, I'll be trying to train the core!
