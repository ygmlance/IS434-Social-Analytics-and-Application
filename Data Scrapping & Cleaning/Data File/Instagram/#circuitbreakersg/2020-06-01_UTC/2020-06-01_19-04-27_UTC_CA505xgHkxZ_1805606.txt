1 Jun 2020: || Dino Dig || 🦖 🦴 
Came across this activity by @2little_lims and really wanted to give it a try! Joseph dived straight into his Dino world, but little did he know there was a fossil world underneath waiting for him to discover 🤗

This little archeologist chucked the brush aside immediately and used his hands instead.. plan failed 🤦🏻‍♂️ That serious look when he pieced the bone puzzles together was a joy to watch. In 30 mins, the puzzle was complete.. and the cocoa flavored moon dough was all over him 🤦🏻‍♂️ Messy but that’s the way we like it 😀

So the prep work started with sculpturing the bones using Salt Dough. Mix 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of salt with 1 cup of water. This should give you enough dough for two sets of bones. Instead of using sand or soil, I decided to make some ‘earth’ out of Moon Dough by mixing 4 cup of flour with a cup of baby oil. It’s that simple.
