Here’s a throwback photo of a sunset pic in Prague taken 3 years ago. Who knows when will we get to travel again. Humans are adaptable & resilient & we need to flock together in these tough times. Let’s do so together. Let’s be kind, spread ❤️ not hate, & remember to always have hope & faith & Grace 🙏🌈🙌 #kindnessmatters #covidstories #locallocoSN #missingtraveldays #circuitbreakersg
