Dinner from @ootoyasg on Sunday (31/5). They do delivery island wide.
.
We had the Oyako Don, Chicken Curry and Mini Chicken Salad. Unfortunately the curry chicken was delivered without the rice. We checked with them and they called back and were very apologetic and refunded $5 for a $16 meal ! .

But overall, we did enjoy the food ðŸ¥˜ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
