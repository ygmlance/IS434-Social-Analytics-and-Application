Since today is the final day of Circuit Breaker, I would like to thank the most strongest team who provided me the entertainment during the Circuit Breaker period it is none other than members of Gain City's Influencers team as most of the members are the workers of showbiz industries like digital creators, models, entertainers (singers, hosts, actors, actresses) as well as the instructors as they also done some outside Gain City as well like hosting the livefeeds for other Facebook pages plus appearing in MediaCorp's productions. I feel the team are doing well for what I need during the Circuit Breaker period started with the song, "Let's #Stayhome Singapore" & then hosted the shopatainment livefeed at Gain City's Facebook page "Shop With Gain City Happy Gang" which the series already had 24 episodes since 20th April 2020. Once again, thank to the Gain City's Influencers team members for providing great loads of entertainment during this period of time. #thankyouforentertainment #appreciation #gaincitysg #influencerssg #circuitbreakersg
