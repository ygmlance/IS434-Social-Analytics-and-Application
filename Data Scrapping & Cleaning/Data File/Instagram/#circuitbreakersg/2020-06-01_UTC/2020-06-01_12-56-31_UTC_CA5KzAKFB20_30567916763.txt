#circuitbreakersg last day (56)

Hello 1 June! Can’t believe we are finally here on the last day of circuit breaker! Ok I know not a lot will change in the next few weeks as we enter phase 1, but hey, we have come a long way!

Lots have changed during this period of almost 2 months, including, ahem, my waistline. 🤣 So I decided to have something light and healthy for dinner tonight. Which is basically a stir-fry of random vegetables that I have in my fridge. Can you spot what’s in here? 😃

At the start of circuit breaker, I said that I would share one thing that I’m grateful for everyday during this time, to remind ourselves that there’s so much in our lives to be grateful for. I’m grateful today that we have finally completed circuit breaker and that things are more stable now. 🤞🏻 Continue to stay safe everyone! #gratitudediary
