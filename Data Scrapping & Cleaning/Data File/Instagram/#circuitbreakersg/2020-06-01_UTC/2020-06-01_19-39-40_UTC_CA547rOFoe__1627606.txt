While the kids are still asleep, I can have a peaceful breakfast with @tonggardensg ! Is everyone counting down to June 2? Are we all prepared for it? Let’s start by doing our routine right, getting good breakfast to start the day! .
.
Consuming nuts and grains are best taken in the morning. Why? Because it can help you ward off fatigue and smoothly regulate blood pressure in the body.
.
.
Try Tong Garden’s Nutrione Bundle which contains different varieties of nuts for just $24, plus cereal drinks and it even includes an eco bag and water bottle! My personal favourite is the Nutrione Breakfast Mix (the one I’m holding☺), and the seaweed.
.
.
Choose from the many varieties! Check out their website to purchase☺️

PS . I will also use the nuts for my granola and cookies!
