Last day of SG #circuitbreaker! And, no new COVID-19 community cases reported today. Tomorrow, we enter Phase 1 of post-circuit breaker period. This calls for a mini celebration! 🎉

Today's delicious wings were super easy to make! I marinated 1 kilo of mid-joint wings with @shermayssingaporefinefood Singapore Meat Marinade. To cook, just bake at 180C for 25 mins.
