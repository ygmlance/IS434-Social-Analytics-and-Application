Day 56, final day of circuit breaker. But I am still working from home till further notice 🤷🏻‍♀️ Today’s breakfast is mee pok from Jalan Tua Kong. The addition of bean sprouts make the meal refreshing. So yummy 👍🏻 #liuzaichi #instafood #whati8today #sgfood #sgfooddiary #sgfoodies #sgeats #sgmakandiary #sgfoodphotography #foodphotography #sgbreakfast #breakfast #jalantuakongmeepok #noodles #hawker #sghawker #circuitbreakersg
