My first attempt of searing tenderloin beef with teriyaki sauce and stirred fried purple cabbage with teriyaki sauce. I think i marinated with too much garlic salt for the steak. I put in the sauce too early. ðŸ¤£ Next round I should attempt to do a simple stir-fried purple cabbage without sauce or sauerkraut purple cabbage in the future. ðŸ¤” There always a next time! #circuitbreakersg #lunch #homecooking
