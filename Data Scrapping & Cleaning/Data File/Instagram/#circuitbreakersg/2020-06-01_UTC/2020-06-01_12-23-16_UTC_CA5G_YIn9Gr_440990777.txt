Fiery end to the last day of #circuitbreakersg the #sunsetsky shows resilience, solidarity and  fortitude. Thank you God for being with Singapore and it's people 
#aprayer that we will not forget and learn to treasure what is truly precious which moth and rust cannot destroy. As we face the fragility of life and minuteness of man, let us search and find the truth, the way and the life. May you be found when He search for You with all our heart
