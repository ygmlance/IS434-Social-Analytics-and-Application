Last sunset of Circuit Breaker. Tomorrow we begin Phase One of reopening. When all this is over, will we look at the world around us differently and receive it anew? Reminds me of something I recently read, written by a theology professor who once taught me...
“Will we learn to live better the remaining moments of our lives because we have thought for at least a short while about transience and death? Or will we see all of this inconvenience and deprivation and suffering as just so much absurdity to be put behind us as quickly and thoroughly as possible?” ~ John G Stackhouse. #magsmusings #sunset #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #nofilter
