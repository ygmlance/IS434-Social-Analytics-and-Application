Super late dinner! Bought the food from fu bbq seafood at chomp chomp food centre!
I love their sambal, itâ€™s matchmade in heaven with their stingray, lala & lady finger! Their stingray was nicely cooked & fresh (no fishy smell at all), Lala was big & succulent (canâ€™t get enough of it), their sauce was so good that we soak our bread in it & nom nom nom ðŸ˜„
Sambal ikan bilis was also another perfect dishðŸ˜‹
Happy tummy but feel so guilty the heavy loaded calories ðŸ˜‚
