• PEACE  EDUCATION ☮️ •

The boys asked, “Mummy, what’s going on?” as they saw buildings being burnt, people protesting, chaos ensued. I began to talk about what had happened - a man named #georgefloyd who had died after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for more than eight minutes, despite his cries saying #icantbreathe. I didn’t mention race at first; they were shocked enough that one human being could do this to another.

I then slowly introduced the fact that Floyd was an African American, a black man, and the police officer is a white man. They previously had no notion of what black and white are - we are all just humans with different skin colour. I then invited them to colour their “gingerbread men” with different skin colours, an activity I learnt from @3mm.montessori, and introduced them as peaceful people; that we are all beautiful no matter our skin colour. Though they still found it a little odd because it really didn’t matter to them right from the start. How lovely, this sweet innocence.

I went on to introduce Martin Luther King Jr, all thanks to @showmehistorybooks for gifting this to us. His life story, in comics form, proved to drive the point of how the blacks had come a long way in the black rights movement - how they were discriminated against, bullied, beaten just because of their skin colour. The boys were appalled and looked a bit more disturbed. We then discussed ways of how to stop this violence - 👦🏻J7 said we should all just be friends; 👦🏻J8 said we could try convincing the other people not to hurt others. It’s never easy, isn’t it?

I admit, I never introduce the idea of race to them explicitly because I had thought it would make them notice the difference when there is no need for it. As they were growing up, they had noticed but never asked why their friends looked different - merely why some of their friends fast, why some of their friends celebrate different festivals. Today on the last day of #circuitbreakersg, they learnt that not all men look the same, and not all men treat all men the same. But we can all make a difference - just by knowing for a start.
