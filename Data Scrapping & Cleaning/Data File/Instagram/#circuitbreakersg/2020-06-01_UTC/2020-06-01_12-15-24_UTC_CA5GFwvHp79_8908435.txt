#Latepost Last night's dinner ðŸ˜‹
Day 55 Circuit Breaker. Always wanted to try this stall but I ended up buying from other stalls cos I was too tired and hungry to join the queue. So finally decided to join the line since it's Sunday. Waited for very long indeed even after placing my order. It better be good.
To no disappointment, the Hor Fun was smooth and chewy and no lack of "wok hey". And it wasn't oily at all! The sliced fish + bittergourd to Hor Fun ratio was just right, as I hate it when I'm left with a lot of noodles with no more meat or vegetables. ðŸ˜…
Hope next time I can come slightly earlier to avoid the peak dinner queue.
