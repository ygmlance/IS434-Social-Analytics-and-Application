Bye bye Teafolia. One of the first BBT casualties in Singapore is Teafolia.
Those staying around Bedok and NorthPoint City should be familiar with this brand, popular for its fruit teas. 
They announced on instagram that they are “permanently closed” due to the “current economic situation”. Oh well. 
More closures here: bit.ly/closedsg .
