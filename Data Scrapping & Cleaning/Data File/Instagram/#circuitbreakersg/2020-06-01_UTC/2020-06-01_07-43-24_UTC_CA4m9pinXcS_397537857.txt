Double-boiled Hashima & Snow Fungus Sweet Soup 雪蛤雪耳糖水. Wanted to make Three Snow Soup 三雪湯, but somehow ate the last snow pear 雪梨 last night and totally forgotten about this dessert 😅 #forgetfulme

Add Hashima, Snow Fungus, Quail Egg & de-seeded Red Dates into a double boiler and boil for 2-3 hours. Add Rock Sugar & Wolfberry before serving. This can be served warm or chilled. The hashima was soaked overnight & snow fungus an hour.

Hashima is known to be nourishing for both the lung and kidney systems. It is recommended for people recovering from prolonged coughs or convalescing after a major illness. The Chinese also believe that Hashima promotes metabolism and moisturises the skin.

Snow fungus helps to tonify the spleen and increases appetite, also nourishes the lungs, healing dry coughs and clearing heat in the lungs. It also helps with physical weakness after recovery from illness, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Its #collagen content is comparable to bird’s nest.

Beauty Soup, anybody 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️?
