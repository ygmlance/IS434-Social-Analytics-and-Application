First day of June and the last day of the Circuit Breaker! We made some beautiful and yummy breakfast this morning for a mini celebration!

Both Little A and me are so looking forward to meeting up with her Yeye, Nai Nai, Mama & Gong Gong after so long. And also the chance to have some real breakfast time together!
