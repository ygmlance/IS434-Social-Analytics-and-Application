Hi everyone, Hong Ray here. I work as a wedding and fashion photographer for the past 11 years @hongrayphotography. 
During this pandemic, many of my shoots were postponed and I am suddenly faced with so much free time to spare. Before COVID, I used to be packed with shoots and editing work every single day. 
I started looking to do other things that I am always passionate about but was always to busy to pursue. One of it is aromatherapy. 
Since I have own studio warehouse space, I decided to put it to good use during this period of time. 
Inspiration Real was started with one goal of making our customers happy. 
11 years being a wedding photographer have thought me that I must always give more value than what the customer has paid for.

I spend 4 weeks researching and looking for ideas on how I should design my first bottle of essential oil. I came across so many types of sticker labels.
At first, I wanted to copy the big brands in their fancy packaging sticker design. But after some deep thinking, I realize it doesn't fit the brand impression I want Inspiration Real to be known for.

I scrapped all the ideas I have compiled and started from square one. The result is a fully handcrafted bottle that is made to order. 
Every time an order is placed, I will use my skills in photoshop to design a custom label. After that, my laser system will turn my vision into reality on a piece of the wood slice.

I believe that it is important to treat customers as personal friends, to treat them with gratitude rather than thinking about profits all the time.
The way I do it is by spending much more time than needed to craft out a piece of my vision for every customer, regardless of how insignificant the order is.

At the time of writing this, this profile only has one follower which is my brother. I hope one day this would become a reminder for me and others to focus on the core values.
