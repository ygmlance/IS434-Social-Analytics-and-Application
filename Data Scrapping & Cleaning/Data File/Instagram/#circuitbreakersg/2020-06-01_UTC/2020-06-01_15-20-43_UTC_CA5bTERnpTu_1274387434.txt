1st June 2020, Day 56, marks the end of circuit breaker period for Singapore. .
.
.
The weather was very predictable in the afternoon with stormy clouds ðŸŒ§ and rainâ˜”. I anticipated the day will fade off into a dull greyish sky.
.
.
Singapore will enter into Phase 1 tomorrow and some activities will resume. Undeniably, we have not completely exited the circuit breaker, as it entails another degree of uncertainty in which the first phase will end before a new usual lifestyle will resume.

As I gazed out of my favourite #windowview with the least hope, I saw a partial #rainbow ðŸŒˆ hanging low on the left sky. WOW! ðŸ¤© I swung to the right. WOW! ðŸ˜Š An amazing #sunset ðŸŒ‡ greeted me with strong intensity, albeit short duration.
.
.
I had some reflections from the extreme and rapid change in weather throughout today. No matter what doubts and worries held you back, we must always remain positive. Every storm in life will be over, followed by a rainbow if you never ever look down.
