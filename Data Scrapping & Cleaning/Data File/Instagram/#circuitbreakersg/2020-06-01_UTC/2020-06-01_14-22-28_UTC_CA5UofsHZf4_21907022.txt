And we survived 56 days of #circuitbreakersg 🤯😄
.
I still remember panicking when PM Lee first announced the CB measures and then breaking down when he announced the extension. We love G loads and it’s an incredible privilege to be able to stay home and spend time with him, but it is also exhausting having to juggle everything else, work and chores and all. I really couldn’t have done it without my husband’s support 😊
.
We also celebrated two birthdays during this CB! Whew! But as the CB draws to an end (and pls let there be no need to close again), I know I’m gonna miss all the extra time I got to spend with G and @lcybryan . We bonded so much, got to know G so much better and watched him grow ☺️💕
