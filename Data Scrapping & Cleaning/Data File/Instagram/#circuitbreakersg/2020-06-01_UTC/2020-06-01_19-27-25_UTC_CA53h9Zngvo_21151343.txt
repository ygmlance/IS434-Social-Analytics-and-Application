It's the tail end of the circuit breaker and we are moving onto Phase 1, a new day with new beginning on a slow path back to normal life. This Covid-19 has changed all our lives, for better or for worst and the entire nation had to adapt to new modes of survival.
It hasn't been easy having to alternate between work and sheltering at home but there are so many things to be grateful and thankful for during this crisis. 
What truly matter most to me : I get to spent more time thru texts/video calls/zoom with those who are always close to my heart, to stay connected and bridge the gap between us since we can't meet in person; more importantly are the precious quality moments with family and enjoying each other's company when we are at home together, from this it strengthened our family bond during this unprecedented 56 days. It's such a joy feeding my loved ones with happier food and meals delivery swap with my best pals. I feel so loved by them thinking of my family during this circuit breaker period. It's such a blessing to have so many great things in my life – family, friends and God. I promise we always got each others back 🥰
