Day 56 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (1 June 2020) - I can hardly believe this is the last day! Wanted to make something special to celebrate but it turned out to be a pretty busy day and I had no time. Instead, I decided to clear the last of the bee hoon and open my first can of #spam on the last day of lockdown! ðŸ˜„ Ended up adding bits and pieces of #leftover ingredients from the fridge though. Not exactly gourmet and it looks an awful mess but #comfortfood for me (My IG account is to document #reallife not reel life anyway) As usual, #nofilter #friedbeehoon #homecooking #stayhomestaysafe
