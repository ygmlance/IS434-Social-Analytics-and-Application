A craving so real but you cannot find a single #tonkatsu shop that could deliver to your place üò≠. And just when I didn‚Äôt feel like cooking today or for the next few days, sucked it up n whipped up my own. For the tonkatsu pedants out there who are punctilious on the cut of pork, this is no pork loin just a slab of frozen pork belly that was sitting in the freezer that I meant to cook for the folks over the weekend. But who cares so long as they are tender & juicy & nicely fried to a gorgeous golden brown n that explosion of crisp crust when I sliced it. No tonkatsu sauce Nor mustard so I made my own using #worchestiresauce, ketchup n honey. Drizzled a wee bit over the meat. Beautiful! Frozen meats are just as good n are cheap.
