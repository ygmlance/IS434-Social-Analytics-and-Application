☔️ all day as we approach the end of #circuitbreakersg and the sense of melancholy sets in... why? 
Shouldn’t I be jumping over the moon with the excitement of returning to normalcy soon? 😅

Is it because I haven’t baked a #cake ?

Or have I been enjoying too much of my time retreating to the safety of #home ? 
Will the world out there look any different from where we have left? 
I hope it’ll get better. #sgunited
