Writing his ABCs! (Lower case)
.
.So, he had developed a special way to write his "b"... Not the right way, but it doesn't really matter to me because it still looks decent enough! And because I've tried so many methods, letting him trace so many times and the moment I asked him to write it without the dots, he couldn't do it!
.
.And when he can't do it, he starts fidgeting and finding excuses to move about... He will also start throwing tantrums at me and then do really naughty things... So, I kinda flared up as well... And at this point, it's his Grandma to the rescue! Grandma found out that instead of writing the "b" with the line from top down, he's actually more comfortable with writing the line bottom up! And he's really consistent with it too! So, this is how he writes his "b" now!
.
.And we are progressing with letters "c" and "d" these two days!
.
. patience, patience, patience!
.
.practice, practice, and more practice!
.
.Jia you, baobei! You can do it! One more week till school re-opens! Will try to teach him as much as I can during this last  week of circuit breaker!
