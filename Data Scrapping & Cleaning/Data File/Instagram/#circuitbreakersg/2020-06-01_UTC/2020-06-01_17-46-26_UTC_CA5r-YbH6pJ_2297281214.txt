Was stuck preparing things for the re-opening of @osteopathichealthcare so I couldn't make time to cook for day 56's dinner... @iamivanlau went to Ghim Moh Market to tapao (takeaway) only to find that it was closed for cleaning... Luckily a small kopitiam (coffee shop) was open so he ordered fried bee hoon (vermicelli) and wat dan hor fun (egg gravy flat rice noodles)... The wok hei (charred aroma) was sooooo yummy! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
