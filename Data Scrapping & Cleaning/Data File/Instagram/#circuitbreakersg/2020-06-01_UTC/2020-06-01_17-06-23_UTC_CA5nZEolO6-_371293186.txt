You mean I have already been "locked" at home for 55 days about 95% of the time other than jog on alternate days + stroll for 45-50 minutes on alternate days?! Oh wow, that tiny virus has managed to stop me from going to the gym & getting my work done in a proper office environment for almost TWO months...Ahhh, never underestimate by the size. I've stopped training for half marathon since 2005 due to left heel spur, switched training on different equipment & never expected myself to have to pick up jogging again...till this tiny virus appeared. 1st week jog was miserable, only managed to do 45 minutes & already felt my soles were painful. At the end of 55 days since I stopped exercising at the gym, I managed to jog 90 minutes on alternate  days & follow by climbing 20 storey. Then back home for 150 sit ups on my beloved AIBI abs toning bench. Think I should be able to slip on my work dress when we finally are allowed to be back to office. 
Phrase 1 opening up still will be the same for me even though my work is classified under essential service, ahhh, continue to sit on my butt & operate from home. It hasn't been easy for me & I've to struggle with picking up learning new skills to master soft copies paperwork & submission & even to help guiding clients to do it along the way...I can only smile even while struggling to accept challenges being thrown at me; someone who is not technology-oriented! Life never stops teaching us. 
Learning Is Journey That Never Ends.
