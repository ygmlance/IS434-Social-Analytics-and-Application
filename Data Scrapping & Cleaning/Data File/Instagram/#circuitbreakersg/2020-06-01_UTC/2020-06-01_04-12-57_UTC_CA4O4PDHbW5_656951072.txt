Final Stay-at-Home Games. Week 5. We are exiting the Circuit Breaker and entering Phase 1.

Thanks to everyone for taking part and playing the games with your little ones in the last 5 weeks. We hope we have brought joy to your home.

Last 6 games and same as before, we are looking for 2 winners for our $30 @grabfoodsg voucher and $25 @greendaysingapore gift card (each). Just post a photo or video of your little ones attempting our Week 5 Games (from a public account) and tag us and 2 friends.
