Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing. 🌱~ John Maxwell .

Since the CB is extended early May, I started this #30daychallenge of workout everyday & working to have a nice abs. I have been following Choe Ting 2 weeks abs workout on youtube but after 30 days, basically not much result lah 🤭 I can see my tummy is flatter & just a little bit of abs line at the side, other than that not as advertised lol 🤣 .

However what I wanted to share is that sometimes when we are working on something, eg exercise routine or even building our dreams. After working for sometime, we didn’t see the result and it’s so easy to feel discouraged and give up halfway. Honestly I hate waking up in the morning to do workout, when there are 101 reasons for me to sleep more. 😴
.

But what’s my biggest takeaway from this is really to master the art of discipline. We are what we repeatedly do. Although I have yet to get the nice abs but I learn to honor my commitment to myself, everyday I show up even for only 10 minutes to do what’s important, pushing myself beyond my comfort zones, in the process, enjoying the moment, good sweat and rediscovering a whole new world about energy. ⚡️

At the end of the day, what matter most is not about the destination but it’s the growing journey. 💪🏻 .

Today, I choose to continue my daily workout journey and also embarking on #30daysgrowth of learning and posting a meaningful content on IG. .
