So while @iamivanlau had his fried rice for lunch, I decided to add the rest of the lechon from @lechonrepublicsg onto my fluffy scrambled eggs... Made a low carb cacao and almond milk smoothie to go with my lunch... Sooooo delish!
We are less than one day from the easing-off of the "circuit breaker"... I'm looking forward to tomorrow but I know I need to up my game and not let my guard down for one second... Just remember, the battle with COVID-19 is not over yet... Sooooo looking forward to the day when we have this who thing under control... üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
