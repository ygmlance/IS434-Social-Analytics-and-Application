Instead of going on yet another fast food run, try these hawker delivery options for a cheap and good burger fix.

The halal chicken burgers from Hot Chick Buns is truly one of a kind. Their Hot Ass-am ($9.45) features charcoal buns sandwiching a succulent fried chicken, blanketed by melty cheese and a tangy assam pedas paste. The stall delivers islandwide via food delivery platforms.

Forget mass-processed fast food, Zipp Burger & Pastaâ€™s wallet-friendly burgers are all hand-moulded with care. Get the Pork Burger ($5.70) or Double Patty Burger ($8.70) for a taste of their hefty, fried pork patty. Delivery fees range from $5 to $10, depending on your location.

Wok In Burger serves unique fusion creations, including a huge Salted Egg Soft Shell Crab Burger ($16.80), as well as a caffeine-infused Coffee Pork Burger ($11.80). There is a minimum order of $50 for delivery, and a flat delivery fee of $5 islandwide.
