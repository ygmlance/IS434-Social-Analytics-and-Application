Steam chicken

Steam chicken is simple but I made sauces that goes well with the chicken to give it a different flavor

Steam chicken
❶ 2 pieces of chicken thigh (bone and skin removed) cut into cubes, marinate with a pinch of salt, sesame oil, half cap of shaoxing wine, 1 teaspoon of grated ginger, 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce, 1 teaspoon of light soya sauce and white pepper. Mix well and marinate for 1 hour. Overnight is fine also.
❷ steam for 15 minutes. There will be essence coming out from the steaming but keep it for the sauce

Sauce
Ingredients: scallion, Chinese celery, garlic
❶ minced garlic and Chinese celery
❷ cut white part of scallion and minced green part
❸ fry garlic until slightly brownish, add white part of scallion, fry for a while, add minced Chinese celery
❹ add chicken essence and mix well. Do need to add additional seasoning because all the flavor come from chicken essence

Ready to serve by combining steam chicken and sauce
