Cruising through Dubai Marina !!!📍Dubai..
..
“New” Dubai Night Views from the water..and live entertainment..
..
We were also served dinner on the cruise.. but it wasn’t that great..
..
There are two types of Dhow cruises in Dubai  Dubai Creek or Dubai Marina.
Dubai Creek will take you back in time as you pass the ancient Souks.
..
Dubai Marina will leave you wide-eyed as you pass through sites like the famous Palm Jumeirah and Burj Al Arab in the Venetian style canal district.
..
If you visit Dubai and wonder which dhow cruise to take.. as the two routes offer distinct experiences, info mentioned above should help..!!👍
