Strength HIIT is back! 🔥
-
Live stream Strength HIIT on Zoom! Get ready to develop strength, endurance and power. Bring in your household items like liquid clothes detergent, rice pack, juice pack/bottle etc. Get creative with what items you can use! 😃
Dumbbells and kettlebells if you have, are awesome too.
Be prepared to work, sweat, enjoy the burn and get results!

My June live stream workout sessions:
• Monday 6:30pm Yoga HIIT
• Thursday 6:30pm Cardio Core HIIT
• Saturday 10:30am Strength HIIT

Each session is 45 mins. And only $10 to join in.

The benefits of attending a LIVE workout session are:
✅ You get coached by me and you will be motivated by me to get through the challenges you are facing during each session. Remember - Challenge Brings Change! 💪
✅ Exercise options will be offered by me. Feel free to do the option that best suits you. No shame in the game. 🤟
✅ You could be doing the session alone in the comfort of your home but you are not alone. You are surrounded with like-minded people who are in the session with you, from start to finish. 🙌
✅ There is no excuse to miss your workout. You only need to put aside 45 minutes and I promise you! You will feel so awesome at the finish line. And be proud of your achievement! 👏

Do not hesitate! It is so much more important now, amidst this Covid-19 pandemic to stay healthy and stay active. See you online in the sessions! 😊

My live stream classes are also on ClassPass for booking - head to Core Collective Live Stream classes. It is 5 credits per session.

Did a Strength HIIT workout session today, together with the husband. The struggle is real. Feel so awesome at the finish! 🤩
