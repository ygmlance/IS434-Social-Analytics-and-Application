Last day of #circuitbreakersg. Two full months of staying home for the kids and hubby. 
These 2 mths the kids managed to pick up new skills and brush up old skills. #evanshaneho learned how to code simple computer games; picked up how to play chess and learn new piano songs. All through online classes that Iâ€™ve signed him for ðŸ˜…
#evainejoyho managed to fix a 100 pieces puzzle in less than 20 mins without help; improved her penmanship and drawing.
Canâ€™t wait for school to be fully opened and resume back to normalcy!
