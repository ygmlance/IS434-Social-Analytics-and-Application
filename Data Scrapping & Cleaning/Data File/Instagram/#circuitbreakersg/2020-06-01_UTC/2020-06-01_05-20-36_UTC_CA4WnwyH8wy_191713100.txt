🕢Dinner: Guo Tie | The Pot Stickers🥟

Who don’t love crispy bottom! 🥰

GuoTie (锅贴）is pan-fried jiaozi, aka potstickers or yaki-gyoza in Japan which typically filled with grounded pork and finely chopped chives or cabbages. 
They are a Northern Chinese style dumpling popular as a street food, appetizer, side order or even as a main in Chinese.

Belonging to a group of Chinese jiaozi dumplings, guotie, also known as potstickers, are prepared by searing the bottom part while the rest of the dumpling is steamed. When all the water is absorbed by the dumplings, they’re left in the pan to crisp and stick to the pan, thus creating a play on textures. 
These aromatic dumplings are perfect paired with the traditional dipping sauce, ginger chinese black rice vinegar. It’s unique aroma really works with dumplings.

Pairing with a bowl of curry laksa topped with with fishcakes, pork shabu and tofu puff, bean sprouts, thick vermicelli (bee hoon noodles) and a sambal ! 
With a bite of a juicy potstickers and a spoonful of rich and creamy laksa broth.

Man, dinner was sinfully good!
