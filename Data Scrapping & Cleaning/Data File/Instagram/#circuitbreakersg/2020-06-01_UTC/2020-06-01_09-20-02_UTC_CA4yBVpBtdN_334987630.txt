As Singapore eases into Phase 1 of ending the Circuit Breaker, putting businesses, education institutes and other services back into operations, we hope everyone has been doing well and keeping active from home. I'm sure everyone misses the outdoor freedom of movement.

Here are some updates to what we have been Elevating, Transforming and now to Execute our classes and new directions! We are excited to share it with you!

Classes have been renamed as follows,

1. Fitspire - A Parkour inspired whole-body cardio workout that uses body weight as an instrument to improve your overall fitness. 
2. TRACE - Parkour skills class that teaches the techniques of movement skills. 
3. HYbrid - A multi-movement discipline class that complements Parkour on its flair of movement skills.  E.g. Animal Flow, Martial Arts, Breakdance, etc.

We are currently conducting online classes with the following schedules,

1. TRACEKids - Every Wed & Friday 5pm (5 to 12 years old)

2. TRACEAdults - Every Tuesday 6pm (12 years and above)

3. FitspireAdults - Every Thursday 7pm (12years and above)

Online classes are in a package of 5 and 10 classes. Each session is 50 minutes with Coach @psycho_myk helming the classes.

Resumption of Physical Classes would be possible after the announcement of Phase 2 dates, that is provided with the proper physical distancing and rules to minimise the spread of Covid-19.

We have our official WhatsApp number, +6587686010. Do drop us a query on this number anytime!

We look forward in connecting with all of you soon! Hit a Like on our Facebook page and follow us on Instagram for updates and keep in touch!

Stay safe, stay united and Let's embrace the new normal and fight the virus! Keep Moving everyone!
