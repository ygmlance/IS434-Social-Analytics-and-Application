As we are going into phase 1 after CB comes to an end, many industries are slowly opening up. The streets of Singapore will no longer look like a scene from the movie “28 Days later”. The streets will slowly be filled with people. 
Since CB started, i have slowly adjusted myself to embrace the new norm. Going into remote advisory has definitely got its perks. You save time traveling and most importantly, you still get to advise your client in the comfort of your home, safely. The only down side, your eyes tire easily cos of the long hours on my laptop and the lifespan of your laptop is shorten. Time to get a new one. 
All in all, the new norm will be part of our life regardless. The faster we adjust to this the faster we are able to move on with our daily lives.
