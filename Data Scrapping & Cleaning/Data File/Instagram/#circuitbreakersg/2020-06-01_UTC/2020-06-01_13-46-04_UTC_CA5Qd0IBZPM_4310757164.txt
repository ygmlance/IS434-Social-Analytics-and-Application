🍛 Today’s Lunch Plate 🍛

First day after the #circuitbreakersg , as usual Monday are the busiest in the week. So opted to make simple yet nutritious lunch, soaked the channa dal for preparing protein tikkas as a snack but “say what” tikkas changed to cashew rich fenugreek channa dal curry 🤣. My motive is to have a green in my every lunchplate thus accomplished.
