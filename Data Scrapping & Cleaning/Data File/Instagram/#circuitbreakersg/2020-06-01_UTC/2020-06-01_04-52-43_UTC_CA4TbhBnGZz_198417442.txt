💖Mint Chocolate Oatmeal💖

Used my last cold brew from @cafecartisan to cook oatmeal for breakfast today. Mint chocolate reminds me of Christmas.🎄 The mint flavour was mild and could be slightly stronger. Had the same intense bitter dark chocolate base as the other chocolate cold brews which I love. 😍 This is way less sweet than Farmhouse Christmas edition peppermint chocolate milk (found Farmhouse one too sweet), or rather I didn’t find this sweet. 👍 My favourite chocolate cold brew would be the earl grey chocolate (found the earl grey notes stood out more than the mint version), followed by mint chocolate and lastly, hazelnut chocolate (didn’t really like the strong nutty taste hmmm... I think hazelnut chocolate tastes nice only when it is sweet like Nutella?). I have 10 almonds a day! Almonds are high in good heart healthy fats! 😊
