We are living in unprecedented times and my boys have asked us endless questions about Covid-19. As the virus evolves, so have we. It has been months and we are constantly adapting to new ways of living and of working.
·
“Learning Through Covid-19” is a limited edition, interactive book catered for Singapore children aged 4-12 years old. They are locally produced so we can easily relate to the messages conveyed.
·
Kudos to @peopleupsg for designing such a fun and engaging book to discuss the virus with children. We love that it answers most of my boys’ questions, covering everything from the origin of Covid-19, to how it spreads, how Singapore is fighting the virus and more.

Each household can now register for a free copy of the book. Just visit @peopleupsg and register at the link in their bio. Stay safe everyone, better days are coming. ♥️
