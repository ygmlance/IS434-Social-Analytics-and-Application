Safe Re-opening

The Circuit Breaker has now come to an end. Essential businesses and school reopens tomorrow Tuesday 2 June 2020.

However, the event / wedding industry is still not in operation yet, and most of us will still continue to work from home.

Couples who will be having their solemnisation this month, do contact your Solemniser (Kadi) to get more information on your venue and time.

As for our clients, we will continue to communicate through WhatsApp, email and phone calls.

For enquiry on our services, do email us at info@weddingandromance.com. We will setup a virtual meeting via Zoom for our initial discussion.
