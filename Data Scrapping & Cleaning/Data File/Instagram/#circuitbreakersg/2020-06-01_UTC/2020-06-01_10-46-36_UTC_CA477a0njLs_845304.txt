Spent the final day of CB conducting a full day training on Skype Business (client requirements).⁣
⁣
Fun fact about Skype Business (which is owner by Microsoft) -⁣
⁣
It’s super not optimised for Mac.⁣
⁣
Mac users will just randomly drop out of the call with no warning or no clue even after dropping.⁣
⁣
As a participant, may be a good excuse to miss parts of the lesson.⁣
⁣
But as trainer? Cannot right?⁣
⁣
So after spending the past few days reconfiguring an old Windows Laptop, fitting into the overall setup etc, with a Mac by the side as a backup (cos yes, Windows users get dropped too, just not as crazily often),⁣
Glad and thankful I managed to fight all the tech fires throughout the day, alone.⁣
⁣
Tl:Dr - Skype Business sucks. Use Zoom or Teams pls.⁣
⁣
Also thankful for CB to be over.⁣
(Even though Phase 1 is well, the same thing)⁣
⁣
🤷🏻‍♂️⁣
