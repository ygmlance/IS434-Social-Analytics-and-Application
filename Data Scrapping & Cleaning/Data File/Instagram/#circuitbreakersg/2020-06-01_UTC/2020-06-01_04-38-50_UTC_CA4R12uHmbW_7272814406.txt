Mom (@mrsclimcancook) got a new order for her double boiled corn soup. She's so excited that she started preparing the ingredients this morning!

Traditional Cantonese soup has always been her forte and I have always been taking them since young. I can't help but admire her zest in life and how she starts taking small orders for fun to keep her mentally active and excited!
