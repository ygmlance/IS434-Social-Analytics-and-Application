@huphup.co, a bespoke local stall selling local favourites
.
Being awarded the Top 10 Mee Siam, it was indeed the must-try with generous serving of fried beancurd and sauce. The sauce was on the lighter side, not as spicy and it was a breeze eating .
.

Laksa is another of their favourites, with loads of hums (cockles), fishcakes, fried beancurd, beansprouts, served with springly vermicelli .

For the non-spice lover folks, the Lor Mee is a good option. Sauce was not starchy, loads with garlic and vinegar. Ingredients were generous portions of braised pork belly, fried fish cakes and an egg. Cut chilli to be requested separately
.
All items are priced at $3 (Regular) or $3.50 (Big), indeed at very pocket-friendly prices. Besides that, they have also launched new drinks, Sour Plum and Herbal Tea to pair with your food .
