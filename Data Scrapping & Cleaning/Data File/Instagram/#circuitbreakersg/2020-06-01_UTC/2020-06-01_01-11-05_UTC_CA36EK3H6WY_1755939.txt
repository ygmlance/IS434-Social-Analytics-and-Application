Oommmmm, it is the last day of the #circuitbreaker today!
Bittersweet. Yays because the kids go back to school but Boo because of the decreased bonding time with them!
Meimei's expression was probably my most go-to expression all day everyday during this CB.
Oommmmm...... *keep calm and drink a soju.
Probably nothing much, will change in phrase 1 post CB I guess, we will still be majorly home.
May all the school-going children, teachers, staff, parents, basically everyone, stay safe and stay protected.
