Episode 4️⃣✅✅✅I know some of my friends are keen for my harvesting video. So here you go.... I have shared some of the benefits of mushrooms. I watched in anticipation for my mushrooms to grow and sprout. In a short span of two weeks, they are ready to be harvested. There is a real sense of achievement seeing the end result. Guess what, I will be using these oyster mushrooms as one of my ingredients for the next episode of “Chef Theodora Easy Recipes”. Do watch this space and I brb!
