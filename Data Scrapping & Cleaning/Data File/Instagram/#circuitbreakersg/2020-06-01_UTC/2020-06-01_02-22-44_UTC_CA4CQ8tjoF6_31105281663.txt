Vegetable broth 🥬🧄🧅🥦🥕🥔🍅
.
We’ve been cooking more than ever during #circuitbreakersg and created lots of vegetable waste as a result. As we do not have the option to compost, here is a great way to save the scraps for something else!

It’s great to use in sauces or soups as a base! You can really extract lots of nutrients from the veggie parts that we won’t normally use or eat, and the natural 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑚𝑖 flavour of vegetables can be tasted.

It’s really easy, too.

𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑝 1: Save the veggie scraps.
.
𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑝 2: Boil them in a big pot. You can add some herbs of choice if you wish for additional flavour!
.
𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑝 3: Once boiled, let it simmer until it reduces. May take your to 3 hours. If you can’t watch the pot, use a slow cooker instead.
.
𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑝 4: Strain the liquid. I use a ladle to continue expressing the juice out of the remaining vegetables. (You can blend the remnants to eat or use as a veggie paste!)
.
𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑝 5: Store into freeze-safe containers and you have vegetable broth ready to use whenever you need to ◡̈
