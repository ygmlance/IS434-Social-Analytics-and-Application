📺 We made 9 videos, WOO! 
8 for the 8 weeks of circuit breaker, and 1 to thank everyone, and reveal our plans for the future! 🥰🎉✨ What started from a fun project created in captivity is now a full-blown YouTube channel and Patreon page. Yes, no one asked (us) but - literally 😆 
Your support on Patreon will not just help us create more entertaining content, but also to give back to the community 💫, something we deeply believe in. 
It's HUGE but we wanna explore the world at large, starting from our own backyard 🇸🇬 We believe in going bout life w a good sense of humour, purpose and candor, and that, with a little creativity, every moment in our day can be an adventure 😉✨ It's gonna be unfiltered fun and a ton of laughs 😂🤡 There's so much we wanna do, to bring to you even w the 🦠 constraints, so STAY TUNED!! 💯 
From us to you, here's a big smushy THANK YOU for all your support ❤️❤️❤️ @chongeileen
