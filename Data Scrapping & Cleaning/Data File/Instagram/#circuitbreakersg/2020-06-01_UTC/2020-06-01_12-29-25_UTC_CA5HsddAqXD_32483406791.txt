I realised I haven’t been cooking for quite a few days since we’ve been mostly eating food that we’ve packed back, and she’s been making brunch too!

Back today because last week I made my order to @kuhlbarra for this fresh salmon and barramundi.

I love how they packed it nicely, and that the two portions that they gave didn’t differ much in size.

So, I made creamy rice with oven-baked brussel sprouts, and pan fried salmon drizzled with mushroom sauce. Sprinkled some chilli flakes for that oomph and colour.

Actually this took me pretty quick to make. The longest was probably the rice since I cooked that in a pan manually. Everything else was super quick. ✌🏻 Can’t wait to cook the barramundi soon! 😬 So excited!
