#strawberry and fruit #granola for #breakfast on the last day of #circuitbreakersg!
And this is followed by 3 phases of #safereopening. In phase 1 we should only leave home for essential activities, and wear a mask when doing so. I do look forward to visiting my parents and father-in-law this coming week! Students also rotate weekly between Home-Based Leaning and returning to school for lessons. All will be required to wear masks or face shields when in school. Graduating students need to attend school daily.
