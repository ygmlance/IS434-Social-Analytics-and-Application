Dinner this evening, was a couple of bowls of steamed rice, the last sprigs of Kai Lan, or Chinese Kale, flash-fried with garlic, and a Chinese-style Squid Sambal, which was put together by sweating minced garlic, cube cut white onions, sliced ginger and sliced red chillies till fragrant, and then throwing in some squid, dried shrimp chilli paste, a sprinkle of white sugar, and a squeeze of Calamansi lime. This was fried for a few seconds and tomato wedges, sprigs of spring onion and a few kaffir lime leaves were thrown in, stirred for a few more seconds at high heat, and it was done! Deliciously sweat inducing! ðŸ˜‹ #stirfriedkailanwithgarlic #sotongsambal #squidsambal #sgfoodtrend #traditionalfood #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
