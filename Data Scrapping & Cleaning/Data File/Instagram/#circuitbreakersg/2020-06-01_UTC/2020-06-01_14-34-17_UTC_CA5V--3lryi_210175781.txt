A few more hours to "Safe Re-Opening"!!.
. 
Finally, we are coming to the end of the Circuit Breaker. It has been a relatively long eight weeks! And also.... I'm happy that I managed to complete 14 days of countdown postings. ðŸ˜„

I want to share this rendition of We Will Get There from TV earlier (song starts around 9:50). This song gives me goosebumps because it reminds me of my first year in Singapore - starting a new life away from my hometown. Back then, every time I took the bus out of NUS, TV Mobile was playing the fun dance version. It was an earworm but I like it very much especially the lyrics. I felt it was describing my situation coming and adapting to Singapore.... And now this is my home.
.
So apt that this song is played before starting Phase 1 tomorrow. Majulah Singapura! ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬.

(ps. don't know how to share the video on instagram - just took a screenshot of the title. Go @gov.sg Facebook page for the video ðŸ˜‰)
