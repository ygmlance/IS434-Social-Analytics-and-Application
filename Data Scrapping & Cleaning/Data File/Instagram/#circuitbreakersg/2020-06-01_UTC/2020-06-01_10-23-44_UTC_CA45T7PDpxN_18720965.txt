Bak Pau(Bao) aka steamed pork buns. My very first attempt. The other day I tried to buy some bao and a few famous shops are either sold out or need to order a day ahead. So troublesome just to eat one bao. Since I have time in between my yoga lessons I tried to make some. Half the recipe yielded 10pieces of baos. Oh my the taste is so good.  Another cravings satisfied. CB really provided me with the opportunity to make a lot of food for the first time which I would hv normally bought it outside.
