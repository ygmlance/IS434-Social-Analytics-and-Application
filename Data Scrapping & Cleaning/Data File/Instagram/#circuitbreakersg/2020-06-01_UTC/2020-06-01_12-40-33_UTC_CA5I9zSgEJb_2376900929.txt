So as we move into the first phase of lifting the Circuit Breaker measures, here's a public service announcement: the Health Ministry has come out to say that wearing face shields on their own without masks isn't safe. I'm raising this up because a lot of people are now of the impression that you can wear one or the other, even as we're preparing to go back to work and the kids back to school. 
My argument the past 2 weeks has been wearing the shields without masks is asking for trouble, and I've had people yelling at my face -- especially by those who have imported these face shields and thinking of making a quick buck selling them-- that the "experts" know better than I do. I may not be an expert, but I'd like to think I have plenty of common sense, and in any case, even medical experts at WHO have been flip-flopping throughout this whole pandemic. 
So please, don't go around telling people wearing those shields on their own is enough just because you were one of those who have jumped on the bandwagon and imported 500+ pieces that you are now trying to sell. 
Look, the "n" in nCOV stands for 'novel', and there's a reason why it's called that: no one really knows anything about if for sure, else why do you think we're so fucked at the moment?

Anyway, it's official, and you're welcome. Wear your masks, not as a means to stop people from spreading things to you, but as a prevention from you spreading anything to others. That's what social responsibility is, never mind if there's a conspiracy or not. .
