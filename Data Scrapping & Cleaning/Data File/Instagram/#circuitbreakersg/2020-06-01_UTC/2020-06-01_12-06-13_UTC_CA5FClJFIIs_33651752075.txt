We have helped @projectstablestaples to reach their goals of $150,000, which will be able to support 2,500 individuals from low income families affected by COVID19 pandemic during this period. 🙆😍😇 Thank you 30+ amazing instructors and 1,200 participants for coming together as one to help the vulnerable families out. We are overwhelmed and touched by the generosity and kindness that all of you have shown. 🙏

Special thanks to the instructors who have joined us last week of May to end off the campaign with a bang! @ahleeshan @cptgregory @bunbunbunz @kaminari_____ @happyliangliang @larcenciel04 @yoginette @stylejoinsrhythm @elevatethestreets  @_jasyngan @ainstaagraam.rehab @journeyofapilatesteacher
