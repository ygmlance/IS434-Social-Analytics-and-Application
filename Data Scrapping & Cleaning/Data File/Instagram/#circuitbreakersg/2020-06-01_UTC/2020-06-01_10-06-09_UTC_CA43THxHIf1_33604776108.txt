23 May, Breakfast, SG - Kimchijeon with dip and honey lemon drink. This was a request from @jocelynjgwee. Our initial attempt became a kimchi stirfry because the batter got stuck on the pan ðŸ˜‚ We resolved the issue by using copious amounts of oil... about 5 tablespoons? Luckily we didn't have to oil it again when we flipped it. Never knew this was such an oily dish :O
