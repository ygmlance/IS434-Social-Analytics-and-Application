It's the first day of a new month. How's everyone holding up? ü§ç

While Singapore will be exiting #CircuitBreakerSG, activities will resume and measures lifted gradually in phases. #GillmanBarracks will continue to remain closed until further notice.

Till we meet again, stay with us right here as we continue to bring you slices of #GillmanGoesOnline, share your #GalleryAtHome snaps, and brighten your feed with more visual arts.
