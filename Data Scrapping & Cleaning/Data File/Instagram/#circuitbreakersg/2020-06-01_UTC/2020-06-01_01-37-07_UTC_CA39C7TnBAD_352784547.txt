It’s the last day of circuit breaker!😊 who is going back to work?😭 one thing that really impressed me is the digital evolution of fnb and the community spirit from these tough times🥰 found out about @tutukuehpapa (started by his Niece if I’m not wrong - hear from my mum) through my HDB Facebook page 💕you can check out his story on @eatbooksg and @zaobaosg ✨circuit breaker turned mr ho tutu kueh from a nameless stall to a sold out online waitlist👏 food verdict: maybe due to crazy orders, the skin is bit dry and can be steamed slightly longer. But the coconut filling is really on point 🥥✨and the uncle very friendly hehe, slot my fam order in between cos we are in the hood🤭 I definitely learn more new things bout my hood thanks to circuit breaker🤗
