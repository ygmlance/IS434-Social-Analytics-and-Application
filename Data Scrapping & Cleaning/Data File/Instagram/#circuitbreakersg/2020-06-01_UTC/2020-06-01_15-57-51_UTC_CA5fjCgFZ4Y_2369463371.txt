The end of #circuitbreakerSG also marks the start of our family’s commitment to embrace mindfulness in our home.
.

The last 2.5months have been a whirlwind of activities leading to new discoveries, immense personal growth on multiple fronts - as a mum, wife and employee, as well as an abundance of quality time with the family. .

It wasn’t all smooth sailing, as there were plenty of adjustments that needed to be made, arguments and disagreements that had to be managed, negotiations and trade-offs to be navigated, tears and laughter, screams, slamming of doors, yellow cards, red cards, nap strikes, punishments, rewards and so forth.
.

This June, we will endeavour to follow closely to this list of mindfulness practices for our family. We will also be sharing our experiences on this journey on our IG story. Leave us a note if you too are embarking on a similar journey of mindfulness. We’d love to swap stories with you.
