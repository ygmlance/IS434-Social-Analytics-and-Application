#Circuitbreakersg Day 56
.
3 consecutive days of the sky, but everyday is different so I never get tired of it
.
After the heavy downpour this afternoon, sunset came with pedal pop hues across the sky, complete with a rainbow ðŸŒˆ or two
.
Definitely a sign of better days ahead as tomorrow marks the 1st day of our move into Phase I of recovery after the circuit breaker
.
Let's all continue to mask up, practice social distancing and good personal hygiene so that we can move into phase II sooner! .
