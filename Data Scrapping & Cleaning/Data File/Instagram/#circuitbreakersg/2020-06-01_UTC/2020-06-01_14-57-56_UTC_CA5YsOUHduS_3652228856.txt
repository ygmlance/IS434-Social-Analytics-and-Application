CB has (kind of) come to an end and I will be one of those who are returning to work in the physical office. Just want to pen down what I am grateful for during this Circuit Breaker and I can read this again next year and every year.

Family - I am grateful for being able to spend alotttt time with my family. My papa for buying lunch for me every day, Mummy for cooking dinner every night, and annoying brother @sylvestersoh for playing his game freaking loudly every night and that one time we played Overcooked.

Friends - Who helped me with sooo much resources especially when the dormitory lock down happened. Friends who non stop delivers food to me making sure I have enough food. And friends whom we continued bonded online even though we have not been able to meet up face to face. You guys know who you are!

Max - Most thankful to you @speedlead25 keeping me active with all the workouts, runs and thankful for us not killing each other cos we are spending 24hrs together (I'M JOKING OK) Grateful to have you around to help me with all the CB dormitory chores. Without you CB will be soooooo boring.

Mr Mao ðŸ˜» - Thank for you disturbing Max for food at 3am every night so I can sleep in peace. And for being so cute every day!

Pruvit - Grateful for Pruvit to let me continue having a side income despite the entire economy downturn. With Pruvit I am able to help so much people change their lives moving towards a better and healthier lifestyle. And also thankful for ketones that I did not put on 2 sizes!!!.
.
Everyone please continue to stay safe and I look forward to meeting everyone over ketones and food in Phase 2/3!
