Today marks Day 56/56 of Singapore's pseudo-lockdown a.k.a. 'Circuit Breaker'. IT'S THE FINAL DAY! IT'S THE  FINAL COUNTDOWN! 
Ending this period with... a  photo of a circuit breaker! 🤪😂🤣 Gedditgeddit?

But seriously, the Phase 1 of 'safe resumption' of services just feels like Circuit Breaker 'light'/'conditional'/'less sweet' lah. 
Plus, we aren't our of the woods yet. This virus is very smart. 🦠

Let's all do our part! 🙏🏽 Hope to be able to meet my friends and see the outside world more when the coronavirus is defeated or lessened! .
