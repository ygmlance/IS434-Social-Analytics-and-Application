Today marks the last day of Circuit Breaker, and we are moving towards Phase 1 tomorrow. It also marks my last day operating from my Home R&D kitchen! 👋 Tomorrow, we will be shifting all the kitchen equipment back to our cafe space, SLICE. It was a bittersweet feeling while I was packing all the equipment. Initially, at the beginning of the Circuit Breaker, I was really struggling with the whole "working from home" notion. On top of that, I also faced challenges getting ingredients for my daily R&Ds. I guess everyone that cooked during this Circuit Breaker can understand this. Gradually, I learnt to adapt to the "new normal" and found my spite life again. Once again, I felt inspired. I began watching Netflix Docu-Series, "Chef's Table"! It was definitely a source of inspiration to try out all the amazing dishes, desserts, and snacks that I have never attempted before. The biggest breakthrough from this Circuit Breaker would definitely be to conquer my fear in working with the oven ♨️! I have definitely gained more knowledge throughout this Circuit Breaker for me to become a more competent chef 👩‍🍳 and trainer for my fellow Visually Impaired friends! 
You can take a look at our Instagram highlights to see the process of my R&Ds through the entire Circuit Breaker! 👋🙂 - 👩‍🍳 Chef Erna
