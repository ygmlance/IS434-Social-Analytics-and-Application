End of 8-week Circuit Breaker. A once-in-a-lifetime experience.

I spent much of it volunteering as a Safe Distancing Enforcement Officer patrolling neighbourhoods, in addition to my intensified workload. It was an eye-opener for a policy officer like me, to work with many from different govt agencies and walks of life. Managed to experience/hear/see the effects of upstream policymaking. Got the rare opportunity to experience the dynamism of front line work, especially when members of public thanked, scolded, threatened, complained and shouted, among many other types of treatment. All in all, no regrets volunteering.
