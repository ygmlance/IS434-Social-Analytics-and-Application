Overall I was pleased with Song Fa Bak Kut Tehâ€™s delivery service.

The food was delivered within the stated timeframe, and it was still warm upon arrival.

Best of all, there were plenty of soup base given so I could do my own soup top-ups!

The flat delivery fee of $3 is also the cheapest Iâ€™ve seen in Singapore so far.
