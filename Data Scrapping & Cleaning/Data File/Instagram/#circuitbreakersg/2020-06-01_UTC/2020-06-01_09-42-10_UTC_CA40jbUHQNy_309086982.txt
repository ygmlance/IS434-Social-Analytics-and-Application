Boufe is closing down end of this month ☹️ Nooo why?!? I’m not exactly a regular but I’ve been there ~15 times over the past few years. Really like their coffee, food & obscure location. Was looking forward to hanging out there after ‘lockdown’ but guess that ain’t happening.. 😞 #SaveFnbSg #CircuitBreakerSg #SingaporeCafe
