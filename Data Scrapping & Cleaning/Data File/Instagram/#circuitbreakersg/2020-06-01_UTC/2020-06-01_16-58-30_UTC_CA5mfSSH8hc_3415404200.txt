Dear COVID-19,

You introduced yourself into our lives in the most inconceivable way. 
You are monstrously ugly and colossally destructive.

Defeated giants amongst us, even though you are only a single-stranded RNA mere nanometres in diameter.

You set a worldwide record, more massive than your predecessors. 
Brought fear in every single one of us. .

Humanity got to stop.
Giving Mother Earth a chance to breathe and heal.
Where everyone is of somewhat equal ground.
A force resting under your command. .

You brought out the resilience in us.
Force us to grow and improve our ability to navigate in difficult times

It takes a pandemic to unveil the best and worst in people. 
In times of hardship, optimism is what differentiates a great man from a mediocre one. .

Believe that there’s always rainbow after a thunderstorm.

As we exit the Circuit Breaker and phase into normality, crossing fingers that there will not be any resurgent spikes. .
Mixed feelings about you but I do appreciate the lessons learnt and the memories etched during the CB. .

Oh… and of course cotton doesn’t come from sheep.

Yes, life still goes on though it might not be the same again.

PS: Pretty pleased with all the 1st in cooking and baking this CB. #wellfed #selfpraise
