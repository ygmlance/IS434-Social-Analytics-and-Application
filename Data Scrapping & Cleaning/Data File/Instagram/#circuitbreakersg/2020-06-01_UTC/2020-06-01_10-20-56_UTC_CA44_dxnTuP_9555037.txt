Woah, hello June, youâ€™ve come around real quick! Today marks the last day of CB, and I can sense a buzz in the air as we move onto Phase 1. Itâ€™s also been six months since we moved back to SingaporeðŸ¤¯ It has definitely felt shorter than that.
.
I look at my two babies and Iâ€™m reminded of the pieces of my heart left in Bangkok, Thailand and Sydney, Australia. Vastly different places, but precious places where they were each conceived and were our homes for awhile. Itâ€™s scary how fast time is flying, and soon these memories will feel like they were just a dreamðŸ¥ºðŸ’”I will always cherish the days when it was the just the three of us, like in this picture from NZ in Apr 2018.
.
I wished we took more photos/videos of our homes overseas so we can show the kids when they grow up. Or maybe itâ€™s a great excuse to bring them back to those exact places next time, you know, just for their sakeðŸ˜˜ Swipe to see the last photo we took before we said goodbye to our Wolli Creek, Sydney apartment. That was one pretty emotional morning :â€™)
