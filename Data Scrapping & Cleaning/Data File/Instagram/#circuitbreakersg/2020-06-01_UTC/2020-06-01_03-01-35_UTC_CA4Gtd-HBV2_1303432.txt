I think I kinda like it 🤍and I could get use to staying in!

My life has changed since circuit breaker measure took place, guess everyone else too. I had the longest break from work ever. This peace is strange, but I guess it's a good strange.🕊 Initially, it was quite a struggle for me but slowly I found myself again, enjoying my alone time and staying sane during this isolation.

When you alter the way you look at things, change your attitude and behaviour, a shift occurs!

Now, tell me do you ever have the time to spend a chill afternoon poring over a good book with coffee at home before this quasi-lockdown? ☕️ Be contented and enjoy while it lasts!
