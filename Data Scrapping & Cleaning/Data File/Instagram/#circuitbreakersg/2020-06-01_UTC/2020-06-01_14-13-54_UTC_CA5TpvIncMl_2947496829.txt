NEW BEGINNING. 
Common name: Burle Marx Philodendron Scientific name: Philodendron imbe ‘variegata’

Reportedly, this species (subspecies) of Philodendron was first discovered by landscape architect, Roberto Burle Marx in 1957, thus the common name of Burle Marx Philodendron. 
Absolutely one of my favorite plant in my collection now! Loving the variegation, leaf shape and leathery-smooth leaf texture. 😍

In order to maintain its variegation in the leaves, it needs high light intensity! When grown in low light intensity, the plant receives signal that it is not capturing light energy efficiently, thus will produce more chlorophyll in the new leaves which makes them green. In the process, it might lose its “whiteness” or variegation. 
It seems to be growing well with me. It threw out a beautifully variegated leaf after 1 week with me! Swipe left to check it out!

Just like the new leaf, it’s a new beginning for many of us tomorrow where #CircuitBreakerSG ends and school resumes! Onwards to new beginning! 
IT WILL ONLY GET BETTER! ;) Don’t forget your mask and thermometer for school tomorrow! 👍🏼 .
