Pasta al Limone with Sauteed Mushrooms | Butter-based pastas that rely mostly on pantry ingredients are great for satisfying cravings for creamy dishes because I don't always have heavy cream at home and would rather not make a special trip to the supermarket just for it. In the case of al Limone, the balance between the acidity of the lemon and the richness of the butter creates a perfect balance which leaves one wanting for more. The key here is really to ensure the starchy pasta water and dairies emulsify to form a sauce that clings well.
