Ever since starting of CB, we have started our online fitness training. For 2 months, it is a long journey, but all of us make it. Tomorrow, the children will be going back to school and fitness program have come to an end. Once again, thanks all the parents and students for the support. And we hope to see all of you back to training soon. Stay safe everyone. And have a wonderful Childrenâ€™s Day!! #online #onlinefitness #fitness #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg #workout #exercise #keepfit #keepfitathome
