Today is the last day of the Circuit Breaker but it's not time to rejoice yet as we slowly move out. 
Tomorrow, we enter Phase 1 of the Circuit Breaker, turn on some switches and see if it trips. Hope it will not, then more switches can be turned on. 
Things will not be the same as pre-Covid-19. For many, it's very annoying, frustrating even. But like many people all over the world, we have to change and the faster we get use to it, the happier we will be and soon, it will become part and parcel of our life - the new norm.

Just like before the CB, I wonder how to survive 24 hr at home - so hot at home. But apart from the higher utilities bill, I survive. In fact, I can easily count more than 15 things I would not have done, if not for the CB. 
New discoveries, new skills, new way of doing things .. there is much to be thankful for.  #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #newnormal
