【Recipe】Perfect weather for some warm pumpkin soup and toasty homemade sandwiches. #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
Actually bought this whole pumpkin 1.5 months back and left it room temp. Surprising very lasting, was still in good condition, just gotten more ripe that’s all. Used half for my soup tonight and it was creamy and delish. 
Made chunky version with fresh broccoli and flaked sautéed salmon. Served along with 3 different sandwiches for variety sake. Ham and cheese, tomato capsicum jam with omelette and cheese with pork floss. Cheese with pork floss was my favourite haha. 
Used my own home-baked banana bread loaf for these sandwiches. Don’t worry it’s not a sweet loaf! Just soft and perfect as sandwiches. Will share the recipe soon!

Used home boiled bone and collagen broth as the base, which you can also find the recipe here on the first post #honeybeemakesboneandcollagenbroth 
Have a restful night all! This marks the end of Circuit Breaker. Let’s slowly move back to normalcy and making things better.☺️🙌🏻 #circuitbreakersg day55
