Yay itâ€™s the end of circuit breaker! This circuit breaker has thought me to embrace more virtual meetings and I really love how itâ€™s so much more productive for my business. Attendance for meetings have also increased due no travel time! But nothing will replace the human connection and Iâ€™m looking forward to meeting family and friends without breaking any law ðŸ˜†
