Weekends were originally for preparing food for the coming week, but with circuit breaker stay-at-home measures things are more than a little awry. But we canâ€™t get out of that habit, so the past Sunday was spent roasting up a couple of chickens so we can have some for a meal, and then the remainder is shredded up to add in future meals. This time round we spread the signature Umami Butter from @themassessg under the skin of the chickens from @keesonggroup to help tenderise and add flavour.  The carcasses go into making chicken stock, so nothing is wasted. How was your weekend?
