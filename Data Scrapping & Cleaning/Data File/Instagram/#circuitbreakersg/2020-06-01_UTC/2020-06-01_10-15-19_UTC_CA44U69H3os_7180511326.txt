Today is the 1st June and we welcome the gradual easing of circuit breaker measures this month. What better way to welcome this than by practising yoga together🧘‍♀️?⁠
⁠
Our meridian yin yoga class tonight focuses on the energy system in your body - India, yogis called this energy "prana" and its pathways "nadis"; in China, it is called "qi", and its pathways "Meridians". ⁠
⁠
Due to the intensity of our modern lives, we tend to disrupt the fluidity of our energy which is explained as ‘stagnant’ energy or ‘depleted’ energy🤢. This can lead to insomnia, lethargy, exhaustion, racing thoughts, body pain and so on.⁠
⁠
💧Yin yoga is a slow and steady process towards finding space in your body and mind by stimulating certain energy pathways in your body. The emphasis is never to forcefully deepen into the pose if your body is not ready. ⁠
⁠
When I first started out, I found it to be a surprisingly meditative practice which teaches you to overcome discomfort through mindful breathing, and learning to let go, and SURRENDER into the pose. ⁠
⁠
The practice of letting go applies in our lives too🙏. Like yin, it is not easy, but well worth practising.⁠
