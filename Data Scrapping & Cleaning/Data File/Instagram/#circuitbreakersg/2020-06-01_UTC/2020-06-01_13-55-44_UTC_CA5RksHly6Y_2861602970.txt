Handmade Abacus seed 算盘子. A traditional Hakka dish. It is called Abacus seed because of it’s round shape and looks like the seeds in an Abacus. Popularly served during Lunar new year as the dish signifies wealth and prosperity, an auspicious dish. I actually like to eat it sweet by dipping it with some sugar. But it’s supposed to be savoury.

It’s similar to Gnocchi, made out of Yam paste and tapioca flour. Soft and chewy. I have a thing for food made with tapioca flour 😨😅 Some ingredients commonly found in Abacus seeds are dried shrimps, mushrooms, minced meat, black fungus and dried cuttlefish. Mostly crunchy ingredients if you realised!

Also had sweet and sour pork. I find it nicer to separate the sauce from the fried pork strips🤤😅 #stayhome #jxeatshome
