1)[19th May] first up, we have the 🇰🇷 Korean army strew 🍢 fresh ingredients from the wet market and the korean ingredients are from @leemart_sg the instant noodles we got from @lee_mart_ is Ramyeon noodle ($0.70 per pact ) and the sauce is Gochujang. Made by mom ❣️ ——————————————————————————-
2) [23rd May] next up, we have the Taiwan minced pork rice, commonly known as 卤肉饭💓 its a really honest and decent taste 👍🏻 I enjoyed it a lot ! Looking forward for the next attempt on this 😋 made by mom❣️

3)[24th May] followed by the creamy seafood 🦞 pasta. Pasta made freshly from @giovanniranausa and the seafood we purchased from @coldstoragesg and the wet market ! This is my third favourite dish from this CB series ❣️ it’s my mom’s first time attempting this recipe and we love it!!
