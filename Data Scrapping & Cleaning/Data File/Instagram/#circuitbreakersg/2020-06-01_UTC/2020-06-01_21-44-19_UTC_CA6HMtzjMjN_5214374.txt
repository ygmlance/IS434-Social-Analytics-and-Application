Circuit Breaker Day 56
Was busy preparing HBL for this week.
The last day if HBL and we were treated with a heavy downpour in the afternoon followed by a wonderful evening sky.
A double rainbow appeared, the second one rather faint. The evening sky was  pretty with orange, purple and pink hues.
A treat to the eyes as we end the last day of Circuit Breaker.
Next up is another phase known as ASS; A Safe Singapore. (Note: I saw this acroynm somewhere but cannot find it now so it might not be what is is actually called)  We will ease Singapore back to a new normal.  2 June is Day 1 of Phase 1 of the easing back.
