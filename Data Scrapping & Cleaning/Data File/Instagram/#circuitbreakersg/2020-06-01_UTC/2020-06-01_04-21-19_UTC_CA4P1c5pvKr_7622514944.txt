We're now in the month of June, with many countries starting to ease their 'lockdown' restrictions! For us in Singapore, the past two months have not been easy at all but we now see some light at the end of the tunnel :) So here's a special pair for us to celebrate the end of 'Circuit Breaker', and a rememberance of how we overcame adversity as one! For all couples, this is surely a meaningful one for your other half!
