1st June: 5 months of 2020 flew past, and I think the last 2 months have been quite a great ride! From kitchen experiments, dine-in date-nights, “masking” around, working out more though gyms r closed, facing my husband 24/7 🤪, videocalls with my mom, WFH, loots & surprises.....I found my new routine and I think I might get withdrawal symptoms when everything gets back to the #oldnormal 😅 Goodbye #circuitbreakersg , you brought me great memories. #stayhomejourney #memoriesforlife❤️
