The last of our 3 celebrations: it didn’t feel right to celebrate in such trying times without giving back in some way. Hence, we will be donating 10% of all orders received in the whole month of June to the Singapore Children’s Society, an organization that protects and nurtures children and youth of all races and religions. Thank you in advance for contributing to and supporting our cause. It is so fitting that today is Day 56 (2 whole months!) of #circuitbreakersg and that tomorrow we will be exiting into Phase 1. Let’s all try and ease into it with positivity, patience, kindness and strength. Stay safe everyone. #bizanniversary
