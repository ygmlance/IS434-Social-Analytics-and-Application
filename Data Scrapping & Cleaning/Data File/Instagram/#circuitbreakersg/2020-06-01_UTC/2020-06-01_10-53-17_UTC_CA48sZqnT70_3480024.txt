[Homecooked] Cir Breaker Day 56 Dinner.

Such a lovely cool evening for a bowl of hot macaroni soup with vegetables, shredded chicken, ham and egg.

I am so loving this floral dish with handle. Perfect for 1 dish meals. Now regretting that I only got 1. Haha。

And by the way, happy end of the SG circuit breaker. Please continue to be vigilant, take good care and stay safe!
