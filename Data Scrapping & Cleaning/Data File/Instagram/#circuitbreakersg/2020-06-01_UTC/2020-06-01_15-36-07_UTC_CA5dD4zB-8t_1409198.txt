HAS IT REALLY BEEN 2 MONTHS OF STAYING AT HOME? Huhuhu.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Anyway, today had been a flurry of events, mostly me trying to finish whatever last minute work that I could, settling house chores so that I won’t have clothes sitting on the sofa for the rest of the week, you get the drift.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Big brother had his online lesson as per normal in the morning. I usually leave him on his own while I go about my chores though I did hear that he was making a “thank you” card. Teacher gave some ideas, like maybe write a card to the postman, the Grabfood or Deliveroo man but he really surprised me! 😭⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
He didn’t pass the card to me personally though. He got his brother to pass the card to me cause this was after I gave him a MIGHTY scolding. I was carrying baby Megat and stepped on his Tomica cars, lost balance and almost fell over. One moment I felt like a volcano going to erupt, and the next moment, I was tearing and called him over to thank him for the card and apologised to him all in one.⁣ Rojak emotions, I tell you.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
