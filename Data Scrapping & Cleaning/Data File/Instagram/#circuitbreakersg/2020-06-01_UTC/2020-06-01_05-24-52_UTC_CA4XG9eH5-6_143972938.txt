Goodbye May and hello June. Back to School June is completely new, as our local school system has always marked June as part of the mid-year month long school holidays. 🤓
School starts tomorrow for small girl, and #HBL for big boy before returning to school next week. 🏫
It's also the beginning of the #newnormal as we exit the CB and move to phase 1 tomorrow. Mask wearing, regular handwashing, proper handling of used mask by rubbing hand sanitizer prior and after mask handling will be the norm. 😷 👈We should have a happy mask wearing emoji? 💪
