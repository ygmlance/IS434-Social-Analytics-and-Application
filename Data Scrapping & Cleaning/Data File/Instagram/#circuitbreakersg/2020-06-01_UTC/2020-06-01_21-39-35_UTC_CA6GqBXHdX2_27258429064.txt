-ER $100,000 Unclaimed GST (Part 3)- Surgical Procedures: 
Dissect, Expose, Extricate & Inosculate

In our most interesting case yet, client's Input Tax/Output Tax/GST Control Account differs from their GST F5 submission to Revenue House (IRAS) by a stunning $200k!

Complication: Their current period opening balance do not tie with its ending balance of a prior period.

Board: "Are you confident to operate?" Peter: "私は失敗しない."
"Watashi wa shippai shinai." (I never fail)
--------------------
{Fast forward to the Emergency Room}

1. Dissect: Break the discrepancy into manageable parts namely the GST Control A/c, Output Tax A/c (GST on Sales) and Input Tax A/c (GST on Purchases). 2. Expose: Perform a line-by-line cross checking between General Ledger’s entries against the Input and Output GST report. The unclaimed Input/unpaid Output Taxes are thus laid bare and exposed fully for further remedy action.

3. Extricate: Reverse out all the manual journal entries posted within the year which contain erroneous double entries. The unaccountable balance derived at the end should reconcile nicely with the unclaimed Input/unpaid Output Taxes amount identified in #2.

4. Inosculate: Post the corrective journal entries for closure. (Duration of Consultancy work: 1 week)
-------------------- We are grateful for the opportunity to render our assistance to the client. It is this very opportunity that we were able to help them uncover the unclaimed $100k GST amount which would otherwise stay hidden in the backdrop of $200k discrepancy.

We have since assisted the client to submit a revised GST return to rectify their records. #circuitbreakersg #financesg #finance #part3
