Dear Customers, Friends and Comrades, 
It is with the heaviest heart to share that D' Underground will close permanently from today. From the Strumm's family, we thank you for all your love and support for the past 2 years and we will carry this love into building our new concepts. Our sister outlet, The Drunken Poet (@thedrunkenpoetsg), remains opened for business and we look forward to seeing you soon. 
Keep yourself updated with our upcoming concepts on our Strummâ€™s HQ's page (@strummshpl)

If you have any enquiries regarding D' Underground or our other outlets, feel free to message us on this platform or you may reach us at hellomarketing@strumms.com.

Let's all continue to do our part in keeping Singapore safe.
