Posted @withregram â€¢ @jeanchen A simple & comforting bowl of soup that I cook often for the family! My first time adding @liloikanbilis scallop powder to the soup. By itself, the soup is flavourful, but with the scallop powder, it was even more yum!ðŸ˜‹ [English Gourd, Carrot & Pork Rib Soup]
Ingredients:
3 pieces pork rib
1 english gourd
2 small carrots
1 tsp @liloikanbilis scallop powder
