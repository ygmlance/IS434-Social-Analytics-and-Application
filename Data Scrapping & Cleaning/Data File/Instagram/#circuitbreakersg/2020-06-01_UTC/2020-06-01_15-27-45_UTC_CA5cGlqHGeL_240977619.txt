So.. we have finally come to the end of CB and into phase 1. Does not make much of a difference to me actually. Theatres are still closed, meetings are still happening online, majority of my work is still counted as non-essential. Yeah.. I guess I'm still gonna be posting workout videos and pictures. But maybe not as frequent lah.. ya'll should be sick of this already.. ðŸ˜‚
.
And yes, while I was using a 8kg kettle bell as weights, my bro @derrickguo decided to use a bouncy ball. See if you can spot it.
