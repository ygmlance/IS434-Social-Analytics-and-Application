I am sure many of us have been waiting for this day to come - the end of circuit breaker. One more day. Just one more day! Finally! 😀 ⁣
⁣
For our industry, unfortunately we still are not able to have face to face meetups with our clients / our colleagues and we still have a few more weeks to go. 🗓 ⁣
⁣
We will be sharing a series of circuit breaker stories on how we have adapted and overcome some of the challenges we have faced in the last two months. Also the discovery of our hidden talents through this period 🥳 ⁣
⁣
Stay tuned and watch this space! 👀
