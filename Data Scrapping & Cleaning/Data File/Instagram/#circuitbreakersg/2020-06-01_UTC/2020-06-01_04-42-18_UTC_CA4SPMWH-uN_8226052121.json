I\u2019m not worried of home emergency repair works even when I am overseas on business trips. \nI have a regular handyman called Tan. He is a jack of all trades, from electrical to plumbing to miscellaneous repairs. I appreciate Tan because he is always quick to diagnose the problem that needed the most repair as well as his 24x7 readiness and skills and he charges me a reasonable fee for each visit. The result is I\u2019m a happy customer who do not have time and of course I do not know how to fix them. He is reliable and his service is good value for money, and also the fact that I can find someone who can fix my problem effectively and efficiently is quite great.

Just hours ago, he fixed my aircon remote control when we all thought it had spoilt! He is the one we turn to in times like this and never leaves us disappointed. However, if it is a more technical fault at hand which requires higher expertise (eg. faulty washing machine/fridge), my family engages an external vendor to help us with it.

For example, if there is fire in a room or throughout the house, I have to leave the house immediately and then call 995.\u00a0An unnecessary 995 call could prevent someone who is truly in danger from getting help so I only call when essential.\n2. Practice / role-play\nFamiliarize with possible emergency situations to help reduce panic or anxiety in case of a real emergency.\nFor example, I create a game with scenarios for my family to test their knowledge. Adapt scenarios accordingly to explore more possible scenarios. Practice several times a year so that we are as prepared as possible to deal with emergencies.\nBelow are some scenarios I have used before to train my children as they are the ones I worry most in the case of an emergency.\nScenario #1: Call an expert\nYou're playing in the living room when you hear a loud noise from the kitchen. You go to see what's happening and see mom on the floor. What should you do? (Check to see if mom can hear me.)\nMom answers you, then tries to get up but can't. She is bleeding a lot. Should you call 995? (Yes, I have to call 995 and ask for an ambulance.)\nWhat do you have to tell 995? (The Emergency is at XXX My mom fell down, she can still talk but she's bleeding a lot and can't get up. I am calling from This is also where we live.)\nCan you wait for the ambulance with your mom? (Yes. I'm not in any danger.)\nScenario #2 : Call an expert\nYou come home from school and see that the door to your house is broken, and you think someone you don't know may be inside. What should you do? (Go to my neighbours' house or use a mobile to call 995.)\nYou come home from school and see that the door to your house is broken, and you think someone you don't know may be inside. What should you tell 995? (Location of the emergency is XXX. Someone I don't know broke down the door to my house and might be inside. I need the police. I am at XXX, my neighbours' house and I'm safe.)\nCan you wait for the police? (Yes, but I have to stay at the neighbours', I can't go home to wait for the police).",

I\u2019d normally call my landlord to take care of it, but government instructions are clear: stay inside and away from others to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\nPlumbers, electricians and handymen and -women are considered essential workers during the COVID-19 crisis. They\u2019ve continued to come to the rescue when a pipe bursts or the electricity goes haywire. It\u2019s frequently hazardous work, pandemic notwithstanding.\nI am thinking: What\u2019s the sense of me not going out if I have somebody who\u2019s going out to multiple houses coming to my house? That defeats the purpose. Is it\u00a0life or death, or life and discomfort? If the washing machine won\u2019t wash or the screen door won\u2019t seamlessly slide, does it make sense to call a professional? Does bringing in a worker\u2014or several\u2014put my safety and theirs at risk? Do I try doing it myself? Is fixing a sink as easy as baking bread?\nWhen should I call a professional? If it\u2019s an emergency or serious issue, I will make the call. Some repairs simply can\u2019t be put off. An untreated electrical shortage could spark a fire. A leaky pipe in one apartment could cause thousands of dollars of water damage in the entire complex. In those situations, I consider it\u2019s necessary to bring in a trained professional, ideally before a situation grows dire.\nIf it\u2019s less urgent, I shall weigh the risks.\nIf I am with my family of five and my washing machine breaks, it might not be feasible to transition to a washboard. But I\u00a0don\u2019t want home-repair workers in my unit. On the flip side, some maintenance workers are hesitant to put themselves at unnecessary risk. The latter makes it trickier to find someone to tackle a job immediately and increases the turnaround time for some repairs.\u00a0It\u2019s not a good time for maintenance unless it\u2019s a serious issue.",

I am learning to be creative. During the circuit breaker, I\u00a0watched step-by-step repair tutorial videos, conferred with friends, borrowed tools from a neighbor contactless and did it myself over the course of several weeks.\u00a0I think it\u2019s good that now I have more of a knowledge of repair work and Circuit Breaker gives me a chance to do that.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, home maintenance falls on a spectrum of difficulty.\u00a0I do understand that most plumbing and electrical work, for example, is best left to the professionals.\u00a0One mistake can cause a lot more damage. If I\u00a0don\u2019t know how to snake a pipe or a garbage disposal, it might leak overnight. In a multi-unit complex, that can get expensive. Because it leaks into the unit below or the unit next door and then it becomes a huge thing.\u00a0Besides property damage, there\u2019s potential damage I could do to myself, e.g. garbage disposals as one source of danger.\nSo now that circuit breaker is over and the condition in SG is more stabilized, I will be calling the experts to help with more serious problems.\n@missprinqueen @chill_nov_1 @wafflespiesallthingsnice",

Others, not so much.\u00a0If a problem is particularly severe and I am not sure how to repair it, consider using a professional home repair service right away. I acct quickly to minimize further damage.\u00a0Once I\u2019ve discovered a problem, it\u2019s important to be timely in my response to the issue. My response should be based on my assessment of the problem. For example, if I find a slow leak in a water supply line, I place a bucket under the leak site to catch any water. This can help prevent water damage to the building. However, a larger leak might be too much to handle with a bucket. In this case, I\u2019ll want to shut off the water supply to the leaky pipe as soon as possible. Find the isolation valve controlling water to that pipe and turn it off.\u00a0Once I\u2019ve mitigated the immediate problem, I take some time to study the issue and get specific advice.\nThere are times I need a set helping hands.\u00a0Some plumbing fixes work best when I have a second person helping you. For example, my kitchen sink have a drain and an overflow. These connected drains reduce the efficiency of a plunger\u2014I plunge the drain, and the air simply comes out the other drain or overflow rather than breaking up the clog. Having a family member to cap the other drain while I plunge the first helps keep the air trapped in the line so the pressure buildup can clear the clog. Also, a second pair of hands and eyes can be useful for improving safety in general. ***If a home emergency is especially difficult or dangerous to fix,\u00a0seek professional help. Professionals have the training and experience to handle most plumbing emergencies while minimizing risks.***\n@missprinqueen @chill_nov_1 @saladsashimiq",

Fixing an appliance on my own can be difficult. Leaving appliance repair up to the professionals makes my life a lot easier. I can call a repairman and have my appliance fixed and back up and running properly without having to move from my seat.\nIt\u2019s easy to give up on my appliances, especially when I have trying to fix them on my own and nothing seems to work. This results in tossing my appliance out every time something goes wrong. Going this route can be expensive and harmful to the environment. Not to mention, it takes up my precious time. Next time my appliances need some repair, I just call my experts unless my phones spoilt...\n@wafflespiesallthingsnice @saladsashimiq @missprinqueen",

Additionally, it may be tempting to try and save money by troubleshooting appliance problems ourselves instead of calling a professional for help. Appliance malfunctions can range from small, easily fixable solutions to large, life-threatening issues. Here are five signs that I should call an appliance repairman for help.\n1.\u00a0I See Smoke or Smell Something Burning\nCommon sense tells us that an appliance emitting smoke is malfunctioning and in need of professional help.\u00a0 Turning off or unplugging the appliance is not enough and can be a fire hazard in the future. An appliance repairman can help me diagnose the source of the smoke. Additionally, do not hesitate to call 995 in an emergency.\n2.\u00a0My Utility Bills are High\nExpensive utility or electricity bills often indicate my appliance(s) may have to put in extra work to get the job done. Dryers with broken heating elements and leaking air conditioners are two common culprits causing my electric bills to skyrocket. \n3.\u00a0My Appliance is Making a New Sound Repeatedly\nSome appliances, such as washing machines and dishwashers can be naturally noisy. However, unexpected grinding or hissing noises can indicate malfunctioning parts of common appliances. Sounds should be investigated immediately to avoid broken parts, massive leaks, and overworked fans or heating/cooling elements.\n4.\u00a0Excess Moisture Builds Up Around my Appliance\nMoisture presence promotes mold growth on a wide range of surfaces, including walls, floors, and both inside and outside of appliances. Moisture can pool up near the bottom of leaking appliances, such as washing machines, refrigerators, and A/C units. Additionally, moisture can appear on walls and crevices in humid rooms due to lack of air flow.\u00a0 If I suspect excess moisture buildup, an appliance repairman can help me diagnose the source of moisture and troubleshoot a plan to dry out.\n5.\u00a0My Appliance is Wobbly or Shifting Unexpectedly\nA wobbly appliance is often a sign of being off-balance or a broken part impacting the rotation.  @saladsashimiq @sweety_pie1231 @wafflespiesallthingsnice",
