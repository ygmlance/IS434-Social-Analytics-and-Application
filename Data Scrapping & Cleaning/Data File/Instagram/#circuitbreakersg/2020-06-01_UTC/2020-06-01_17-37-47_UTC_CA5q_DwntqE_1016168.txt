#Circuitbreakersg day 56

The last day of CCB and onward to CCBP1. Canâ€™t believe we have stayed home for so many days. 
Taking today slow & easy. Not wasting my leftover so tried the trending KFC rice cooker rice hack & I must say... itâ€™s yums. A mixed of claypot & fried rice.
And I still have another 2 pc chicken left. ðŸ˜­

Lunch : ðŸ”º KFC leftover chicken pieces (1 pc original, 1 pc hot & spicy) with frozen peas
& canned button mushrooms. ~
