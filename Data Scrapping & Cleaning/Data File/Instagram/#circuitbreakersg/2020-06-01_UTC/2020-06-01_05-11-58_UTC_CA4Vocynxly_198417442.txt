ðŸ’–Homemade Wagyu Beef BurgerðŸ’–
âœ…Wagyu Beef Patty from @zairyosg - Easy to cook. Donâ€™t need any seasoning. Just defrost and pan fry. Juicy and no smelly beefy smell. And not salty like some beef burgers I ate outside before.
âœ…Gluten free burger bun from @the_wholekitchen - I toasted these frozen buns in the oven till heated through than pan fry the insides with olive oil butter. âœ…Cheddar cheese
âœ…Microwaved sunny side egg - No oil needed only need to crack egg in a ceramic bowl and heat up in microwave for 30s.
âœ…Shredded lettuce âœ…Ginger lemon kombucha from @littlefarms - My favourite kombucha brand and flavour. No added sugar, low in calories and good for digestive health. It is slightly carbonated so it is a healthier alternative to any soft drinks. Ginger lemon flavour you can taste the ginger but it is not too pungent spicy. ðŸ’“
