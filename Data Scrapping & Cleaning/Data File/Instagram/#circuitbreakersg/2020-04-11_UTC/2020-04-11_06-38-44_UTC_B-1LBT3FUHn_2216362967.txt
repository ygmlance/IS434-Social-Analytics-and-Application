Stir-fry Ee-fu noodles
.
Soften 3x Ee-fu noodles using hot water, rinse, drain and set aside.

Saute sliced garlic and onions till fragrant, add in veg stems and stir fry, cover and steam for 30s. Add in veg leaf and stir fry with same cover and steam method. Dish out and set aside.

Stir fry marinated meat till cooked, add in Ee-fu noodles and stir fry. Pour in seasoning (1 cup water, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 1/2 tbsp sugar, a pinch of salt) and continue to stir fry till almost dry but not dry. Off heat and serve. The noodles will continue to absorb so it'll be just nice when you eat it.
