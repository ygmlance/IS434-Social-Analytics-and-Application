dessert of the day
.
. 
green bean soup with sago & tapioca jelly
. 
hand in hand with @carolinecksp first time making these jelly from scratch using tapioca flour. lucky us, our third attempt was a success ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
.
added brown raw sugar n some pandan leaves to enhance the enjoyment of the soup. this common sweet dessert is light yet nutritious can be taken warm or chilled. i love it warm n anytime of the dayðŸ¥°
