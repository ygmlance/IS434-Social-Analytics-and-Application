#HBL has started since Wednesday 8th April. Teacher Rin will sing, dance and read us a storybook at 9am. Then at 11.30am 韩老师 will sing, dance and do an activity with us. Daddy captured down partial of 韩老师's lesson and I truly enjoyed myself dancing and seeing my friends on the screen! 😊 ⁣

(Mummy: We absolutely love the last video and 韩老师 can be heard praising her 🤭 Her Chinese name is 雅萱 - lookout for that! And the song has been etched on our brains already 🤣 挥之不去啊啊啊)⁣
