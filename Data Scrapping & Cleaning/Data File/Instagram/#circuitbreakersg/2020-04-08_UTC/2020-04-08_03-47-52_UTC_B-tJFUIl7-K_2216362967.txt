Green bean soup (aka Mung bean soup)
.
Washed and soaked 2 cups of green beans for at least 15 mins. Boil 14 cups of water in a pot. Drain the green beans and add to boiling water. We like this variation with pearl sago so I added 1/4 cup of it into the boiling water as well.

When mixture is boiling, stir it and turned to low heat so it remains a soft boil. Cover and continue soft boiling. At 20mins, the water has turned a murky green colour. Stir and continue soft boiling so the beans will be soft. At 40mins, add in rock sugar to taste and stir till dissolved. Off heat at 50mins or you can off at 1h for even softer and mushy beans.
