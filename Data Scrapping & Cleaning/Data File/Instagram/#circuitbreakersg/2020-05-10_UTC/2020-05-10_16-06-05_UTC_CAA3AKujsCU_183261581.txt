Had  homecooked fish soup, and handmade pancakes for lunch

Kwalets ordered delivery from the 2 Michelin Star Shisen Hanten by Chen Kentaro for dinner.  As with all delivered meals..... food is not as good as eating at the Restaurant itself 😝😅The mapo toufu was a disappointment tho the stir fried prawns in chilly sauce, the kurobuta pork in dark vinegar and the Roasted London Duck were good!😋😋😋😋 #stayhome#staysafe
