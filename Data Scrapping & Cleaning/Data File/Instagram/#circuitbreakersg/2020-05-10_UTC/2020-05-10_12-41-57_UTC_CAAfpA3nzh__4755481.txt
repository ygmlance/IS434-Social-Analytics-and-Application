#uglydelicious #cottagepie for dinner
I made a #beefandguinnessstew a few weeks ago and had leftover gravy that was so good I couldnâ€™t throw it out. So I saved it and bought some #beefmince and made a cottage pie with the said gravy in the beef sauce. Paired with #butterymash topping, for a very scrumptious meal.
