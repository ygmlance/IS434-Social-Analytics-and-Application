Happy Mother's Day! ðŸ’— It's a great day to show love and gratitude to the mothers (or mother figures) in our lives.

Here's something we all know in Singapore, but don't always consider: many of our domestic helpers are mothers too. They bravely leave their families and home countries to earn an income and provide for their loved ones.

This is a difficult time for all of us, especially mothers who have to leave their families behind due to work. Please join me in raising funds for Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), an organisation that cares for these good people. Click on link in my bio for your tickets now!

It's said that a mother's love knows no bounds. Let us love and care for these folks in our midst as if they were our own. ðŸ’—
