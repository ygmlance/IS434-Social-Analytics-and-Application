Handstand walk 🤸🏻‍♂️ ⁣
⁣
Haven't done this in about a year or more, so I almost went for a drink at the start of the video. But much like riding a bicycle, movement that requires more skill than strength is lower in maintenance - it just takes awhile to dust off the rust before you can get it going again.
⁣
This is why the handstand is a good starting point for more advanced calisthenics training - it teaches body control with lower strength demands, at least in the static and walking positions. Handstand pushups are another matter altogether, but learning the handstand will get you there.

Stay safe, but stay active! 💪🏼
