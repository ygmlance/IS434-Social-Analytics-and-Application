I help out with chores almost daily, cleaning, putting away dishes, tidying up, doing my own laundry...I would like to say to my mum, THANK YOU for choosing to be a full-time mum to my siblings and I since I was born as a first child. Nobody can teach anyone to be a mother and the unexpected experiences and lessons are learned and managed along the road of parenting... now that you're approaching your golden years, hope that your children can now take care of you more, and that you can be more relaxed and start feeling more joy and peace. Here's us enjoying a family staycation early this year!! 😀🤗😘👏👭♥️♥️
