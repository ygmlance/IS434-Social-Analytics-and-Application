Have been in a daze since the #circuitbreakersg started. Been eating non stopðŸ˜± Time to wait up and smell the coffeeðŸ˜… another 20 odds days before the CB ends. So decided to eat healthy from today onwards. Cooked #chickensoup with mushrooms and cabbage without any carbs. Hope to reduce some kilo by Jun 1. #circuitbreakercookingchallenge #foodinsing #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodinstagram #sgfoodiary #sgfoodsteps #homecookedmeal#healthyfood
