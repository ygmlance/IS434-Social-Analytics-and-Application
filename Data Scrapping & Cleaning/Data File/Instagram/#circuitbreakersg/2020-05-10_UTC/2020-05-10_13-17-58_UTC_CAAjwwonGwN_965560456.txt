Today i get to try out making an all purpose cleaning spray. This spray can be used to sanitize countertops , disinfect bathroom & toilets and as well as cleaning windows & mirrors . Itâ€™s really easy and you can give it a try !  Items u need: ðŸ”¹300 ml water. ðŸ”¹300 ml white vinegar ðŸ”¹Spray bottle (preferably recycled from previous used product) ðŸ”¹funnel and measuring jug -ðŸ”¹Essential Oil of your choice  1.Measure out the water and vinegar using the measuring jug. Pour them using the funnel into the spray bottle.  2. Add your fave essential oils to the water to reduce the harsh smell of vinegar . (For me , i love adding tea tree oil & lemon oil to it. Tea tree oil had antiseptic properties and lemon oil keep the place smelling refreshed!) 3. After all the ingredients are added, I would give it a good shake and you are good to go! #homemade #gogreen #homeprojects #stayhomestaysafe #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
