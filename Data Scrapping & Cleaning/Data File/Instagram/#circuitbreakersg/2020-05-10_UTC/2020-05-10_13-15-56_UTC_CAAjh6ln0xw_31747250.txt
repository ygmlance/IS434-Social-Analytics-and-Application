My brother sent over a Ondeh Ondeh cake from @ollella_singapore for Mother’s Day.
.
The fragrance of pandan and gula melaka is evidently there but the grated coconut (there’s three layers of them!) proved a little too much for me to bear.
.
I wouldn’t use the words “soft”, “spongy” or “fluffy” to describe the cake as the texture seems kind of coarse particularly the base.
.
It took some considerable effort to cut through the cake with the plastic knife supplied and when I poke a fork through my slice, it just crumbled.
.
It is my first time having a Ondeh Ondeh cake hence I am not really sure if it is supposed to be like this?
