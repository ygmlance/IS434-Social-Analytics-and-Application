Day 6 Hols = Day 34 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Waist Whittler Cardio Pilates workout 
#7dayabchallenge

Decided to sleep with the kids, told stories to each other and we all knocked out pretty much earlier (no idea what time). Finally, into Day 7 of the #blogilates 7 DAY abs Challenge, woke up just for this. And I'm glad that it's done. Do I feel stronger? Yup. Do I have toned abs? Errr... Not sure. Are there areas of improvement? Yes, my alternate leg lifts, double leg lifts, leg drops, basically my lower abs needs more work. 
Also, I had 2 days of ice cream but watched the rest of my diet, as for water, I made sure I drink at least 1.5litres (it's lesser than 64oz) of water.. So.. Getting stronger has more than the exercise factor, u must remember that! 
Anyway, Happy Sunday and Happy Mother's Day to all the mummies out there!
