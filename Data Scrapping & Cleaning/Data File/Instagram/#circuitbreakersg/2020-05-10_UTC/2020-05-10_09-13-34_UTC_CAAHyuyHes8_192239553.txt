Mum, her girls and grandkids
.
Mum and I are similar in other ways apart from our physical semblance
.
As first time mums, we intervened more in our firstborns’ lives and expected lots
.
We tend to have more exchanges that may not end well though they stem from care and love
.
I appreciate how much you want the best for me and how you pray for me each day
.
Your views are important to me though I don’t make you feel so at times
.
Blessed Mother’s Day and may God keep you well and safe for years to come
