Don't remember how my folks look like when they were younger till my didi @jacsups dug up this photo. This should be taken about 30 years ago. 
Fast track 30 years later, we are all grown up while the folks have aged a lot. Last year, we made the choice to bring the folks to Japan after much delay. It was their first time to the Land of Rising Sun. I am glad that we made the trip last year looking at current situation. 
It's Mother's Day today. Though we can't celebrate together physically, we hope Mama Lee can still feel our love with all the gifts and food delivered to cck. Thank you Mama Lee for providing us with the best, along with Papa Lee. 
#throwback to last year's Japan trip. Let's do another family trip soon in 2021!
@joobaba @jacsups Let's do re-enactment of this scene after CB!
