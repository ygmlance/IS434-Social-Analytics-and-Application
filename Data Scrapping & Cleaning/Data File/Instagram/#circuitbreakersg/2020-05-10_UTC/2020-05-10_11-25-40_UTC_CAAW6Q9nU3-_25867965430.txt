Managed to finally try out The Feather Bladeâ€™s Steak and Mash after hearing raving reviews about it comparing it to Flat Iron steak in the UK.

Verdict - the steak is really tasty and comes on a bed of mashes potatoes and sichuan peppercorn sauce. But since I have a big appetite this wasnt enough for me and I had something else after.

Still a really good steak though I prefer the ribeye cuts with a lil more fat. Worth the $25 and flat $8 delivery fee if you feel like having some decent steak during this CB period ðŸ˜›
