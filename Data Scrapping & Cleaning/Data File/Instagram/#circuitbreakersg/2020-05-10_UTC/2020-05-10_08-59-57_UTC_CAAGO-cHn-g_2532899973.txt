Sunday Kueh - Pulut Serimuka. When was the last time I made this? Need to scroll down my IG. Today I decided to make everything I like - Coz Mothers Day. The amount of food delivery I spent on the past month or so is not too bad. I only used it less than 6 times. That’s pretty impressive as I used to use it almost daily. .

The past month or so too taught me to learn to love what I cook or bake. I hope I don’t sound narcissistic. I did it as a goal in the beginning by posting all my non classy bakes or cooking not desperate for followers but as a form of motivation. Motivation to do it often so that it becomes a habit to cook a warm meal when Rick and Nad comes home. It’s funny that the past month was the most productive I’ve had over the course of 5 years trying to achieve this goal. Nothing beats seeing your family enjoy what you cook and seeing their plates empty. That makes a mums heart feel really warm inside and I now understand how my mum feels when we eat what she cooks or how disappointed she feels when she calls me asking ‘Mama cooked this for you... do you want?’ Sorry mama I’m still at work and I won’t be home yet. You know how that feels?? .

Happy Mother’s Day to all the responsible, strong, always thinking for your children, always sacrificing their happiness for their children and family happiness kinda Mum!
