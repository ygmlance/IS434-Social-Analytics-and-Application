Today’s Mother’s Day.
.
We are both so incredibly lucky to have two wonderful women in our lives that we call Mom / Ma / Mother. Who have always showed us love and taught us countless of things.
.
But two things remind top of memory - and I’m glad I found pictures to depict them!
.
1. ALWAYS EXPLORE - I took this picture of Kel and his mom when we were at a pub in Beijing. It was totally empty - Kel was playing pool by himself cos I didn’t feel like playing it then. And my MIL told me she hasn’t played it before - so I encouraged her to go try it. And that’s when Kel got into all teacher mode. She never quite got the hang of it, but I don’t think that really matters. (She also gamely did a zipline with us in Europe even though she was scared, and had her eyes closed and prayed throughout the entire zipline.)
.
2. ALWAYS LOVE - I really love this picture of my mom with my eldest nephew cos it depicts so much love and happiness, no words will ever suffice. This is how pure love looks like.
.
3. With us not being able to meet our mothers due to the circuit breaker, we gave into commercialization and sent them flowers cos we felt it would make them happy. I went through a lot of bouquet selections, and on first look, we both agreed this is the one - bright, happy and simple.
.
And that’s what we wish for them - May the days always be bright, happy and simple for them.
.
Happy Mother’s Day to all mothers, and soon to be mothers. For the other women wishing to become one, I hope your wish comes true soon. 🍀💛
