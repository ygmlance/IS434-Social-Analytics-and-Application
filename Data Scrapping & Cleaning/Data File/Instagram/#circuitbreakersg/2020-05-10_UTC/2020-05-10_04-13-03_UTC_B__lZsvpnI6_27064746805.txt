There are days I like to pair sake with cuisines other than Japanese. But for this evening I played it the traditional way and paired with Japanese food. We ordered a fantastic Uni Don and Wagyu Don.

Colour🌈: Clear pale yellow
Nose👃: Fruity, rich, round, 
Palate👅: Rich, round, creamy, dry. In Sake category, Jun-Shu. Medium plus body, medium plus finish. 
My Thoughts ®️: This was 35% rice polishing of Yukimegame from Yamagata prefecture. Smells like being back in Japan. This was so lovely! Pair it with food and brings out the sweetness in the sake. Especially the creaminess of Uni works very well with the fruity nose of this sake.
