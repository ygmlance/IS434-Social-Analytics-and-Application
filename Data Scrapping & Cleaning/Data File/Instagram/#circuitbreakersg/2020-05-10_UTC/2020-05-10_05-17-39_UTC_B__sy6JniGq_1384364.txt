Happy Motherâ€™s Day!
.
.
Enjoying our crabs from @banleongwahhoe. Had requested for male crabs as they are meatier... but mom did ask, whereâ€™s the roe? ðŸ˜œ....
.
.
Did tell her itâ€™s for her health and cholesterol thatâ€™s why I purposely didnâ€™t ask for female crabs this time.
.
.
Crabs were big and fresh. The black pepper one was surprisingly good, in fact very good and I barely ate the chili crab one coz I was so focused on it.

Anyway to all mothers, enjoy this special day! #happymothersday #hawkersunited2020 #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
