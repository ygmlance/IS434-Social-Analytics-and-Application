Thank you for making me a mum, my dear M & A! I never realize how fulfilling and tough a mum’s role is until I became 1 myself. Taking care of 1 requires a lot of effort, sacrifices and care. Juggling 2 is even more challenging. It’s a continuous learning journey and I will continue to do and give the best I can. I love you my munchkins. ❤️ I hope one day when you become mum and dad yourselves, you will understand what l do and never forget to give thanks. #motherhood #mothersday2020 #circuitbreakersg #infant #siblings #toddler #mumof2 #familylove
