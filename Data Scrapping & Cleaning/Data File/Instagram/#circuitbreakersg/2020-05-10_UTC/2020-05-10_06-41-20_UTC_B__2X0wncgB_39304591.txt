#CHERYLMILESCOOKS 👩🏻‍🍳 So the #coronavirus #pandemic has delayed my launch date for #CHERYLWRITESACOOKBOOK to somewhere closer to Christmas. But the good news is the extra time has allowed me to add 3 more dessert recipes & 10 more new recipes for a total of about 80 recipes for “Smitten in the Kitchen ~ Recipes for Love”. 🤩 Here’s one new addition I’ve been working on... Sea Salt Brownies with Marshmallow Sauce. 🍫 
In the meantime, you can download my charity e-cookbook featuring 16 recipes for FREE with a minimum donation of S$30 and above at https://www.giving.sg/campaigns/cherylmiles_foodfromtheheart. (Link in bio 👆🏼) @foodfromtheheartsg runs two monthly food pack programmes, School Goodie Bag and Community Food Pack (CFP). The number of beneficiaries has grown as a result of many people losing their livelihoods during this time. 🥀At the end of 2019, the two programmes supported 6,375 families. Due to the impact of #covid19 on our economy, the number has grown to 7,900 in April 2020 and is expected to grow further in the coming months. 🥀The charity needs $300k each month to ensure the needy receives these food packs. Your $30 donation will provide one family with essentials like Rice, Cooking Oil, Baked Beans, Coffee, Condensed Milk, Cracker, Instant Noodles, Instant Oats, Milo & Sardines. 
Please help me raise $20k for this worthy cause, if you are able to donate during this time. ♥️
