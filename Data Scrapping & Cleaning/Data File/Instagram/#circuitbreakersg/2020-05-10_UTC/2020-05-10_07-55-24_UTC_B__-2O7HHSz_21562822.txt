Teach a man to make Thosai AND HE WILL BE... fat, just fat. Because he can eat it everyday. Especially with the amount of Samy's curry leftover. BTW its actually very easy to make, there's like the Indian thosai version of Betty crockers sold in NTUC. Just throw in the flour mix with water, spread over flat pan and TADAAAA!
