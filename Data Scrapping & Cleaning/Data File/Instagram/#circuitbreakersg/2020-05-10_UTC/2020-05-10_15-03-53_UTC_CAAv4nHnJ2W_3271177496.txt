Happy Mother's Day to all mums and happy birthday to my mum. To celebrate the occasion we ordered takeaway from Hong Kong Street Chun Tat Kee. The veggies in Pic 7 were home cooked. /

𝐓𝐋;𝐃𝐑 : Some hits and misses. Stick to the zi char staples and skip the crabs. /

Pic 1: 𝐋𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐍𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬. Obligatory dish whenever we celebrate our parents' birthdays. It's decent, nothing fantastic. It only comes in one size, so small families might have a hard time finishing it.
.
Pic 2: 𝐒𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐅𝐢𝐬𝐡 𝐁𝐞𝐞 𝐇𝐨𝐨𝐧. One of their signature dishes and it did not disappoint. The fish slices were thick and fresh while the soup was amazingly rich and sweet.
.

Pic 3: 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢 𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐛. What was supposed to be the star of the show (since it's the most expensive dish at $50 per crab) turned out underwhelming. The sauce evoked the requisite sweet and spicy notes but was somewhat watered down.
.
Pic 4: 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧. Crispy, yes, but the prawn paste wasn't very pronounced. Needs some improvement. .

Pic 5: 𝐃𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐧 𝐑𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐬 (hae zhor). All it needs to do was be crispy. Great job! .

Pic 6: 𝐋𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐁𝐮𝐧𝐬. Bought from NTUC Fairprice. Performed the role of supporting actor competently. /

𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭: I visited this eatery a couple of times previously and the dishes were generally good. However their crabs are miles behind established players in the mid-budget range like Uncle Leong.
