Had a burger craving, so decided to try my hand at assembling a burger for Friday night dinner!
.

Used the Bruno grill plate to grill the patties which is just minced beef, seasoned with salt & pepper, and added 2 slices of cheddar on top! Before that, I also toasted the buns for warmth and texture, and caramelised the onions for sweetness too. All in all, a worthy effort for a craving satisfied. 😉😉😉
.

The kids had their “MCD” fave of chicken nuggets & fries! 😋😋😋
