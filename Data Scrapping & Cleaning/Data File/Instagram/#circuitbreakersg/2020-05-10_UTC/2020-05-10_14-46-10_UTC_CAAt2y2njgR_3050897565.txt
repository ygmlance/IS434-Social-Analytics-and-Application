Today we ate a hell lot. We had popiah and dabaoed @liaofanhawkerchan. Also had pancakes for tea but that's another story.
I'm posting the roast meats here first instead of the signature braised chicken because like the first taste some years ago when he was still a stall in Chinatown food centre before his Michelin star, it was the roasts which struck me. Charsiew was charred and crackling was crispy! Braised chicken is lovely but I generally find it too pink across all places I eat at.
