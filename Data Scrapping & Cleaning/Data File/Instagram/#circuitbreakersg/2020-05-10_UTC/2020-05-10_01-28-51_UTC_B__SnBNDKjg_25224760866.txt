It’s been a crazy week!!
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting to you my daughter, Elle Tanya Ho ❤️❤️❤️ she joined us on 1May, and she’s a week old! ;D

Thank you wifey, Crystle Ho for the immense energy needed to bring her into the world in this strange time!!! ❤️❤️❤️ Can’t wait for circuit breaker to end so she can see our family, friends, and the world!! 😢 
A little bit about Elle:
- she has my voice (when she cries, everyone around comes over to ask if she’s ok - apparently this was also my talent when I was a kid)
- she loves to pee in the bath tub while we’re bathing her -_- (so far she’s had 110% success. Extra 10% because she hits me with the pee too)
- she slaps & kicks when she’s hungry, exactly the same when she was inside Crystle’s tummy (Crystle used to have to stop and wait till she stopped kicking her internally on the ribs)
