a very amateur attempt at mille crepe cake for Motherâ€™s Day ðŸ˜Ÿ ( we followed @buzzfeedtasty mille crepe cake recipe). Usually I would only post food that taste really good IMO on this page but I am putting this here because itâ€™s real hard work and sweat dedicated to making this cake for the first time ever!!! Some mistakes we made was: 
1. No heavy cream so we substituted it with powered milk cream + cornstarch 
2. The layers of crepe were TOO thick 
3. We should probably whip our own whipping cream instead of using the store bought whipped cream
4. Donâ€™t add TOO much Hershey kisses chocolate!!! End result: our chocolate ganache was too watery and it can solidify for us to put the powered icing sugar on top. The layers were toooooo thick ( seriously, this crepe require skilllssssss). The store bought whipped cream were too soft and liquify too fast, there is no volume in between the layers ðŸ˜–. It made us feel like weâ€™re just eating cocoa flavoured pancakes haha. The ganache was the saving grace to save the kinda plain crepe because the whipped cream is missing in between the layers but itâ€™s TOO sweet ðŸ˜‚. But at the end of the day, itâ€™s the effort that counts & my aunt really appreciate us slogging our ass off in the kitchen to produce this WONDERFUL cake ðŸ’• 
Happy Motherâ€™s Day to all Mothers out there, thank you for always feeding our stomach ðŸ˜­ itâ€™s not easy at all. âœ¨
