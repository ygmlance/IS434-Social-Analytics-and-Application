An afternoon online discussion on Negroni variations led me to immediately try one as i had the ingredients onhand. This variation was made with equal amounts of The Botanist Islay Dry Gin, Contratto Vermouth Bianco, Contratto Aperitif and a dash of Angostura Orange Bitters. Itâ€™s not a Negroni Bianco, as it uses the Aperol-like Contratto Aperitif, neither is it a Contessa, as it uses Vermouth Bianco, instead of Vermouth Extra Dry. Iâ€™m calling it a Negroni Oro! It is gently bitter, and is slightly less alcoholic than a regular Negroni. ðŸ˜‹ #negronioro #negroni #cocktails #afternooncocktail #onlinediscussions #stayathome #drinkathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
