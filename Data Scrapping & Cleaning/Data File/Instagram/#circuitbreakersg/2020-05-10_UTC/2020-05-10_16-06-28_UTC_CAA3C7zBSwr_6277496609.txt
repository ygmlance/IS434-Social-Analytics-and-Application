Ayam cili tenyeh and laksudon from @jenggoodjommakan I ordered both level 3 and level 0 of the ayam cili tenyeh. The level 3 didnâ€™t give you a chance at all right from the very first bite, the spices sting your tastebuds ya ampunnnn but by golly the lovely rice and laksa sauce accompaniment (you could also choose cheese sauce) helped things a bit. I was sweating and had to pour myself a 2nd glass (something I havenâ€™t done throughout this iftar) but this is what we say #pedastapisedap so I finished the entire packet ðŸ˜… Oh btw level 0 is much milder but I think some people might still find it a tad spicy. The laksudon has never disappointed!. Itâ€™s the dish that first introduced me to jenggood and its creaminess hits all the right places in your palate. The udon noodles reminded me of how my late paternal grandma used to make her laksa although she got her noods supplies from Siglap. Anyway because of Motherâ€™s Day today, we had a free dish their mango pulut which was pretty nice. The mangoes were sweet and the pulut very lemak especially with the santan. Check out their IG profile for the link to order (one day in advance)
