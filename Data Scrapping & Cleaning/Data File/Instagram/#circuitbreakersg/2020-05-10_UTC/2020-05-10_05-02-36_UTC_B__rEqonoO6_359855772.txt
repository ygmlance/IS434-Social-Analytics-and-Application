Happy Mother's Day to all mothers and mothers-to-be. 🌸
愿天下所有的母亲，母亲节快乐！💐 Mother's Day is a celebration honoring the mother of the family, as well as motherhood, maternal bonds, and the influence of mothers in society. It is celebrated on various days in many parts of the world, in Singapore, it is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. 
This Mother's day, we can't go for the usual grandparents visiting due to the circuit breaker measurements, so Kpo Kia can only wish the grandmothers Happy Mother's Day over Whatsapp video calls. Instead of getting a cake from store to satisfy my cake craving, we bake cheesecake the day before, and have it as our breakfast today.
