Sunday Dinner was a couple of burgers! The burger patties were home-made, using 55% lean minced beef, 14% fat, 18% minced pork and 13% bacon bits, and were pan-fried in lard. They were topped with sauteed mushrooms with onions, sliced tomatoes, arugula and a sprinkling of freshly ground Kampot red peppercorns, and sandwiched between pan-buttered burger brioche from @bakerybrera Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #hamburgers #sundaydinner #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
