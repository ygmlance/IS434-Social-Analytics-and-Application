Give your mum the gift of space this weekend. She needs it, the physical space, the mental space, the emotional space to just BE. If she wants to just stay in her PJs and read her kindle, let her do exactly that. ⠀⠀
Mums don’t stop until the entire family does, and I can tell you that in most cases, they continue Long after everyone is well looked after.
⠀⠀
She takes care of everyone and everything, that’s why the laundry is always fresh, the food is always ready, and the groceries are always managed. That’s why the toys are packed away, and the place is clean in the morning. That’s why the flowers keep growing and that favourite hazelnut milk you love so much is there. That’s why your favourite pancakes are served. Because she gives you everything before she gives herself anything. ⠀⠀
So yes, go on, give her that space today. Shower her with that gift today, that and oils. ;) She will appreciate it very much.(I know my husband is reading this, so here’s a big hint!!)
