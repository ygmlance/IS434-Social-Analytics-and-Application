My mum loves these Nyonya Bak Zhang (Sweet Pork or Chicken filled Glutinous Rice Dumpling) paired here with homemade Barley drink.
.
These dumplings reminds mummy of her mum. My grandmama was an excellent cook who owned an eatery & was an award winning chef. Mama taught me Cooking & mum a self-taught home baking entrepreneur, Baking.
.
My passion in the kitchen is a result of these 2 talented & successful women. Then, there is Godma who taught me how to tame &  open my mind.
.
These 3 amazingly independent & feisty women taught me life is a series of challenges you just need to learn how to maneuver-around & move on.
.
I dedicate this post to mummy, Godma V & Mama Linda whoâ€™s watching over us - â€˜Thank you, the sum of you 3 is why I am who I am today - Happy, Contented & Loved. Happy Motherâ€™s Day.
