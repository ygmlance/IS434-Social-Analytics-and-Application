You have been a loyal employee in your job for the past 35 years. Given at the age of 6\ufe0f\u20e30\ufe0f\u20e3, you seldom complain about being lethargic even when you need to take care of your grandchildren  during your post-retirement stage.\n2) Teacher\nYou always willingly share your knowledge and principles to help us grow and develop over the years. You never allow us to take things for granted and always remind us to cherish what we have at the present. From the food on the table to the good education you have paid for, you will make us appreciate the values in everything we have!\n3) Friend\nYou naturally show kindness, compassion and interest in our family. Whenever you are \ud83c\udd93, you will spare some time to listen to us and have a good chat with us. You are just like everyone's best friend in the family! \n4) Exemplar\nYou show by the way you live an example of what the family stands for. You will not smoke if you don't want us to do it, and likewise does not drink heavily if you do not want us to do so. You taught us to deal with conflict in our family and with others by being firm but reasonable at the same time! \n5) Patriarch\nYou are honoured because of your moral character and actions. You don't expect us to live the same kind of life you do, and do the same kind of work. You respected our values and opinions, as long as they don't harm the family or anyone else! \n6) Disciplinarian\nYou helped us learn proper boundaries and consequences. You will strongly disapprove any of our misdeeds by using tough love to prove a point. You did this through the power of your words, not your fists. Likewise, you don't reward us for actions that are expected of us, such as helping with house chores or performing well in school!\nThank you for all the selfless sacrifices \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\nI LOVE \ud83d\udc9f YOU MUM \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8b",

This will be my Mother's Day present to her. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f And I cook Mama favorite Fish Head Curry and Drunken Chicken, although I can't cook as well like her and burnt the curry chicken but I believe she can feel the love behind and how much I appreciate her.\nMy mama, she\u2019s amazing. \ud83d\udc96\nI will never forget the difficult period when Mama was pregnant with me and the pain when she gave birth to me. Also the hardships mama had been through during the years when my dad was fighting his liver cancer. She was the pillar of strength and source of income for the whole family. She never once complained or falter. She supported my sis and I who were then, still studying while taking care of my dad who was frail and weak. Despite having to juggle both work and house chores, she had never once complained, and stayed strong throughout. Whenever my dad felt like giving up, she\u2019d be the one, reading all sorts of books, trying her very best to find means to cure his illness. She\u2019d cook him nutritious meals and make fresh fruit juice everyday even though she was already so exhausted from work. And every night she will spend time to check my homework and ask my progress because she know I am not doing well in school. The encouragement she gives, the care and concern she shows, the many good times we shared, the times she pampered me and so forth. \nThis is mother\u2019s love! The little things she does everyday. Be it rain or shine, she will still do it for you unconditionally. It is of such innocence, yet it has no boundaries and limit. Mama will always be there! \nThankful for mama always being there for me! Now whenever I am in trouble, I will always ask my heart - \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Every single time it replies: \u201cDo what your mother would tell you to do\u201d My mama will always be the guiding light in my life! \ud83c\udf1f She\u2019s amazing. \ud83d\udc96 She is an extraordinary woman with extraordinary love. @meiqinkb @rahrahkoh @hannah_joana__",

This year, ironically, staying home allows me to consider home-special way of celebrating Mother\u2019s Day! My mum and I went Fairprice (not many shops open) for shopping and we picked some flour and yeast. I bake a bread, yes not a cake, a sweet potato bread from a rice cooker. Something my mum used so often for cooking rice for us. And I used the same to bake her a dinner roll on a special day. \ud83c\udf60\ud83c\udf5e\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf77\ud83e\udd70 @shopavision",
