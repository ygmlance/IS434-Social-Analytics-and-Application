Every mother deserves a cake like this from @breadtalksg. Coz they have to clean everyone’s shit almost every single day.

Truth be told, i wasn’t too keen on doing anything for Mother’s Day. I know the hubs will not get me a cake or any flowers. This day is just too depressing coz if you scroll through social media, u’ll see how mothers are celebrated. It is just not in his culture to do so. Not even for his own mom. Coupled with the fact that my hormones decided to spiral out of control again, I really had no mood. Right up till Friday coz the kids were so enthusiastic about making cards and little gifts for me. Big K even secretly learned how to make a paper flower from Youtube. swipe to see how lovely it looks! She definitely is highly influenced by her mama.
.
So I thought to myself, i should not disappoint them. I am their role model and I should continue to be a good one! i got myself this cake (using the supplementary card no less) and made myself a simple topper. .
This morning, Small K was rhe first to come in to shower me with hugs and kisses and tons of cards together with a handmade bouquet. I was suddenly overwhelmed, i cried and he asked,”mama, are those tears of joy?” They were a mix, baby boy. He wouldn’t quite understand and so we continued hugging for a good 15mins.
.
i knew the day would still be like any other day. Chores, entertainment for the kids and food. But @daprayer and @certainlee had different plans for me. They think I should totally chill and give myself a break. I was terribly surprised and touched by the treats which arrived at my door. Felt so loved, i teared. .
So i mentioned that it isn’t in the hub’s culture to celebrate such commercial occasions but guess what? He willingly joined the kids and me for an art jamming session and declared that he felt good.  If you know him, he is no an arty farty guy for sure. So that gesture made me happy.
.
Grateful, thankful and blessed to be a mama to my Big & Small K. Let’s all continue to be a supermom to our children!
.
To all mummies out there, Happy Mother’s Day! .
