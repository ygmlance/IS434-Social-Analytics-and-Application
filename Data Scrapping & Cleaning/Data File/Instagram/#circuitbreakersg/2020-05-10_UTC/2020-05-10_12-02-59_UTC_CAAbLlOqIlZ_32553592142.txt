What do you think a strong core actually means?⠀
⠀
🔹Does a strong core = popping abs?⠀
⠀
❌No! Your core is actually made up of:⠀
⠀
✅Rectus abdominis (your abs)⠀
✅Transverse abdominis (deep core muscles)⠀
✅Obliques (at the side of your abdomen)⠀
✅Erector spinae (lower back muscles)⠀
⠀
🔹A strong core is not only aesthetically pleasing, it also gives you better balance and posture. ⠀
⠀
🔹So, wanna build a strong core in a quick and effective way?⠀
