HAPPY MOTHERâ€™S DAY! 
Iâ€™m so blessed to have a mother who can cook/bake so well. I donâ€™t have to worry about being hungry any day at homeðŸ˜­ Thank you Mummy. 
Rice dumplings from ä½³è®°ç¾Žé£Ÿ Jia Ji Mei Shi @jiajimeishi. 
They are famous for their Yam Cakes (Orh Kueh) & they also have other chinese all day breakfast like Chee Cheong fan, Soon Kueh, Glutinous rice, Rice dumplings, Porridge and etc. It is always long queue at their stall located in Chinatown complex. Plus, itâ€™s really affordable.

Got their rice dumplings - Pork rice dumpling (è‚‰ç²½) and Nyona rice dumpling (å¨˜æƒ¹ç²½). Thanks for the complimentary Glutinous rice for Motherâ€™s day ðŸ¥° 
They are currently providing delivery service for selected locations during this circuit breaker period. Preorder is required, do order soon if you want to try. Check out their IG @jiajimeishi for more info.
