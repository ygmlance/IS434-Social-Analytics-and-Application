Day 33 circuit breaker thoughts:

Sometimes we are tested. Not to show our weaknesses but to discover our strengths.

I'm passing the hardest moments alone, while everyone believed that I'm fine... Since it is out of my hands, it deserves freedom from my mind too.

Letting go has become my new superpower.

Also, I realised how people reacts to my sadness says alot of how long they are going to be in my life.
