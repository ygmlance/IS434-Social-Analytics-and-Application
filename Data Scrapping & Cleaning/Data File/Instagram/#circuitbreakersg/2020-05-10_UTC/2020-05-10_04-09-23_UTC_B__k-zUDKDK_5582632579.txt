假如每天都是母亲节…该多好！今早，本宫直接睡到自然醒，梳洗完毕就可直接用早膳。哇塞！“幸福来得太突然”🥰🤔😍

What a luxury! To be able to sleep in and laze in bed until it’s time for breakfast 😂😂 Today I’m off kitchen duties becoz the son wanted to make me a Mother’s Day breakfast (he is such a darling sometimes).. 🥰 His father helped him cook while I laid in bed trying not think of the disaster they were creating in the kitchen 😓.
.
They did a decent job! 👏👏 I even got a Gardens-By-The-Bay look-alike model as a gift. 😂😂 . .
Happy Mother’s Day to all!
