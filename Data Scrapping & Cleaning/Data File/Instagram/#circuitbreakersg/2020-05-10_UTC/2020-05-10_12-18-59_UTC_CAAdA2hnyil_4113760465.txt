We're so lucky to be here in Singapore where we can have such lovely meals at home despite our circuit breaker. I guess this is the closest we'll get to a family meal together at @odetterestaurant till everything goes back to normal. Happy Mother's Day @catherine.bnoh and to myself too as a new mom! ðŸ¥°
