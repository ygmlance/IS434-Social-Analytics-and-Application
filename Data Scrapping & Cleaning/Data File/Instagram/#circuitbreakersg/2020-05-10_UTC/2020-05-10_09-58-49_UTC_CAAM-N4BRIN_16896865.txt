Typical Makcik must haves is the fake flower and wooden table and their cup of tea that they couldn’t live without, Agree?

My mama is an essential worker, she work’s at NTUC Fairprice means my house will forever have essentials 🙌🏼
...
She doesn’t wear much make up those are her favourite MAC products she LOVES especially NUDE lipstick!! ...
I will always find my nude lipsticks in her room 🧐😆
Her favs are Velvet Teddy,Yash,Craving & Burnt Spice!!
...
Its ok because when i was young i LOVE to use her make up and now is the other way round
...
I remember when i was young i cried my lungs out on my first day of Pri 1 because i couldn’t be separated from my mama and when she goes off to work i hated her for leaving me behind with my grandma i am totally dramatic as years past i grew up giving her high blood pressure cos i am one stubborn hard-headed i dunoe how she can tolerate me but hehe i love you ma well i got it from you? 🤣🤷🏻‍♀️
...
