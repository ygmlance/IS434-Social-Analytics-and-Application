God granted me the most beautiful gifts in life is having the both of you as my children. I am very proud & honored to be your mum! Thank you #kyanong and daddy for doing up this card (actually this is his school holiday work) 🤣 He bolded all the Chinese characters himself. It’s a little special this year because #motherday2020 falls on #circuitbreakersg. Happy Mother’s Day to all the 伟大妈妈！#kyanxkayzel #iamaproudmummy
