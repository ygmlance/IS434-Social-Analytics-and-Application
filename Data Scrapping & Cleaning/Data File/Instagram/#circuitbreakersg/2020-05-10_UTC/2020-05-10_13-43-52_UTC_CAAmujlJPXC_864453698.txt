Dabao-ed this tasty Tempura Set ($15.90++) from Tendon Ginza Itsuki for lunch the other day!

I was impressed by the high quality packaging!

The tempura was tasty, though the batter would probably have been more crispy if eaten fresh in the shop.

Overall this was still quite a satisfying meal!

Hope everyone had a good Sunday, and Happy Mother’s Day to all you wonderful moms out there 😊❤️
