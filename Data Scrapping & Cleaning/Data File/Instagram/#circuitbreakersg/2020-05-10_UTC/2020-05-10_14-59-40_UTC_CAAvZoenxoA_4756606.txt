🍢Day 34/56•Stayhome Dinner 
Happy Mother's Day to all mummies! Hope you had a wonderful day 😉 We had our fave @brunohotplatesg BBQ at home... Had choice of beef & fish 😍 using Snapper filet which I ordered from @haisiaseafood couple days back...so fresh & delicate flesh! Definitely Kbros' current fave fish!
