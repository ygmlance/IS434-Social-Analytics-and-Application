Today is a special day to all mothers in the world! And as a fellow mom, the constant fear of our children getting hurt/sick is real! Just the slightest sign of flu or even a cut on their arms and limbs will make me worry so much, all day, everyday.. And so my greatest wish on this day is that my kiddos (including the furbaby) are healthy and happy!
.
.I'm truly blessed this day because I get to witness some amazing moments at home too! My son made me a bracelet and according to the daddy, the video message after that is free play by him:) (I shared the video on my instastory) On top of that, this four year old of mine.....OFFICIALLY GRADUATED from diapers!!!! He finally went to the toilet himself to pass motion and pass urine! 😭😭😭 HE IS NOW TOILET TRAINED!!! .
.My littlest is sitting up now with some assistance... And her love for her gor gor grows even more with each passing day!
.
.And, ask me what I feel most fortunate about this mother's day?? It's not just about the gifts my hubby pampers me or how my kiddos are growing... One thing I feel really really fortunate is to have my mum with me every single day! @anthea6396 老妈您辛苦了❤️ You are tired yet you chose to help me with clover and ask me to go grab somemore rest... You don't have to, but you still chose to help us wash our dishes and fold our laundry... Sorry to keep making you so tired because you have a sleepyhead daughter who sleeps in so often! And last but not least, thank you for choosing to stay in with us during this circuit breaker to help me relief my load at home... 老妈，谢谢你 ! Love you loads! ♥️
