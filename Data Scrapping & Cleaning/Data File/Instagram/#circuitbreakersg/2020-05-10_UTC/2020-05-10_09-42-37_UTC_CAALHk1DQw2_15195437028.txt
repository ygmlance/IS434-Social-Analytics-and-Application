❇️Next week schedule❇️
Holistic Yoga :
- morning 45 min Tuesday and Thursday
- evening 1 hour Wednesday (compatible with Europe time zone > 12 pm Paris time) 
And I am proposing this week a 🆕new class, to focus on strengthening and core (mid section muscles). It will be a medium pace session, with targeted exercises and we'll end up with stretch and cool down.
Come try it, it'll be fun!

Price : in this time of covid19, some of us face financial challenges, so the amount you pay is up to you. We suggest 12$ for the 45min class and $15 for the one hour class.
