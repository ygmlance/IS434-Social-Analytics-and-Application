Learning about phonics with my 2.5 year old. It has been more than a month of home-based learning with Sheldon. I think I gained more than him in this journey, such fulfilling experience! I hope I still have time for Sheldon after I bring his sister home in 3 days. 💪🏻 #sgtoddler #sgbaby #instatoddler #instababy #toddlerfriendly #toddleractivitiesathome #sheldonsim #2yo #29monthsold #activeparentssgchallenge #homebasedlearning #playtolearn #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #phonics
