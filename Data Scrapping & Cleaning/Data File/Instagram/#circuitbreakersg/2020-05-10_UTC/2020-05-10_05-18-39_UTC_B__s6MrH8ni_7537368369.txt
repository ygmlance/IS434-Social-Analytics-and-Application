This isn't the most glamorous of pictures, but really food doesn't always need to be presented beautifully to be good. My sister popped by with lovely roast duck from @imperialtreasuresg for us and threw in a bottle of @moetchandon cos it was mother's day! Thanks @mummy_ed!! And happy mother's day to all the hard working mothers out there.
