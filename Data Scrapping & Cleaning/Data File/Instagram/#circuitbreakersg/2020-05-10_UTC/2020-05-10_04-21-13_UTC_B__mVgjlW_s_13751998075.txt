💐Happy Mother’s day to all that holds this very important role in life. Whether you are a mother to your own children, grandmother, a mother figure to someone else’s children and a God mother. It is a pretty intense role to take and to be in. Indeed we should appreciate whoever takes on this role every day. But we celebrate them extra special today. 
Most cakes gets sold out and since it is the #circuitbreakersg period, limited bakeries are open. 
Thank you @wildbloomssg for these awesome sweet treat.  We have Grandma’s vanilla butter pound cake and Homemade dark chocolate brownies!
 Ordered through @foodpandasg and within half an hour it came knocking at our door. 
These little treats definitely put a smile on a beautiful mother today. 
Stay safe everyone! 🌹
