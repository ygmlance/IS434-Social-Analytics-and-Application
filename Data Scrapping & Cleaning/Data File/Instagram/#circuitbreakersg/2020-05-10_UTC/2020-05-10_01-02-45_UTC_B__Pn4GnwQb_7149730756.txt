“When the circuit breaker was implemented and Home-Based Learning started, I thought that I’d have the chance to spend more time with my kids, boy was I wrong. As it turns out, preparing material and conducting classes online is so much more time consuming than doing it in school. A typical 8 hour day easily extends up to 12 hours nowadays!⠀ ⠀
⠀
Sometimes at the end of the day, I realise it’s already midnight. The children are in bed and I’ve barely spent two hours of quality time with them. I question myself on nights like this – why do I spend so much time with other children but not my own? Am I doing enough as a mother?⠀ ⠀
⠀
I’ve spent the past few weeks thinking about this, and my answer ironically comes from my philosophy towards teaching: Each student is different and as teachers we can adapt to an array of techniques to meet the needs of each child. Similarly for parenting, each parent-child dynamic is unique – there isn’t a fixed metric to judge yourself as a parent. We don’t have to hold our parenting standards up to fixed societal norms. As long as we are able to reach the minds and hearts of our children, then I’d say that we’ve done good as mothers.⠀ ⠀
⠀
So I don’t let those negative thoughts rob me of my motherhood. A mother should be like an anchor that stands firm in all storms. Someone that has the power to overcome anything she may be facing if she wants to, and I continuously strive to be that mother. If we, as mothers, try our best and can answer to ourselves, none of us will have to lose our confidence and competence.⠀ ⠀
⠀
Don’t let the insecurities rob you of your motherhood. There’s far too little time for that. We just have to accept the bad days whilst celebrating the good ones. So Happy Mother’s Day to my fellow mothers. Remember: No matter how we sometimes doubt ourselves – as long as we tried our best, we are good enough.”⠀⠀
