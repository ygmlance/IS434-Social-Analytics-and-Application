Ordered a bunch of kuehs from Lek Lim Nonya Cake as a last minute Mother’s Day treat (because I couldn’t find durians for her).
I love the yam cake (you see a bit of it in the pic) and chive kueh, but my heart was all for the peanut Ang ku kueh. Love how the filling is not that sweet, but still dense, although the skin was slightly sticky because I left it out for a while. 
There is a version with coconut that I regret not ordering but there’s always next time.
This CB may be tough for the F&B industry but as a consumer, suddenly my choices have opened up so much. Wouldn’t have known about Lek Lim otherwise!
