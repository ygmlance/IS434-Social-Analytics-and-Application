Day 34 - #circuitbreakersg
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
Happy Mother's Day!
🥰
It has been awhile since we had family photo together. Notice any difference?
Thanks to hubby for buying delicious food back and sweetest surprise from my sweetest comrade. Kiddos are more compliant to help me with chores today (no choice right)
😅
Loving my official off day from work and from home. Did minimal chores and spent my time resting more - healing my strained ankle.🦶 Back to full time mommy duties tomorrow and I think its time for more workout once my ankle heals. 😂
