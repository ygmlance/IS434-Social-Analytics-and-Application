Today Mum requested for Japanese Meal. Made our very own cold soba noodles and brought some 🍣for Mother’s Day Dinner. There are a lot of things to thank my mum for, not just today but Everyday of my life.To me she has shown me examples of a woman of God by her action and deeds.  谢谢你妈妈，母亲节快乐。祝你建康，幸福，快乐，美满，我伟大的母亲。#mothersday#circuitbreakersg#Stayhomemothersday#japanesedinner
