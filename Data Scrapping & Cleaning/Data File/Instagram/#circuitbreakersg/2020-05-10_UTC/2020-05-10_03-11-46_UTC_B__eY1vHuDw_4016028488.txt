A strong woman is a lifeline for her family. She carries with her the power to endure and the courage to sacrifice. She has the power to create and nurture life. She is the epitome of love and sacrifice. - Aarti Khurana

Ashepa is lucky to have the power of many women. Today we celebrate these women for their love and sacrifice.
