Appointments are well spaced out to allow for social distancing and for disinfection of  rooms before-and-after each session.

Sessions will be prioritized according to severity. We seek your kind understanding and cooperation to keep everyone safe.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you would like to arrange for a face-to-face speech therapy session. Meanwhile, all tele-services are available as usual! Take care and stay safe!ðŸ’ž .
