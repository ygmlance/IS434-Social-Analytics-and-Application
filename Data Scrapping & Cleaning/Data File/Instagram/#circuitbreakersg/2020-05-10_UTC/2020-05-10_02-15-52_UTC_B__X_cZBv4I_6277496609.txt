Lavender Cheese Bread
.
This was really a last-minute experiment. I had wanted to use my bread machine but one thing led to another I ended up making the dough by hand. -
250gm bread flour, 5gm yeast. Mix and set aside for 5 mins. Then I added 180ml cold water (mixed with 1 tablespoon condensed milk) to the flour and just mix it around until it becomes one big lumpy mess and left it aside for an hour
.
When I got back the dough had risen to about twice its size but still sticky. So I just sprinkled some more bread flour and kneaded the dough. Ok this one I tried to recall a Jamie Oliver video I watched (punch it down, pull apart fold into half and repeat several times until the dough became less sticky and more uniform). After that I grated lavender cheese (about 2-3 sticks - I didnâ€™t measure haha) into the bowl and kneaded the dough some more for about 5-10 mins. After that I just separated the dough into 2 and each one I split it again and then I put 4 of those into one pan making sure thereâ€™s enough room for the dough to rise further. Then whatever dough I left with I just fashioned it into a bun-like shape and put in another pan
.
Baked at 180deg. At about 25 min mark, I turned the pan around to make sure both ends are equally heated. When itâ€™s browned nicely and skewer comes out nicely itâ€™s done. The smell of freshly baked bread and lavender cheese is just divine, I tell you. .
Taste test not bad la. The crust is crispy but the inside is pretty soft with a subtle whiff of lavender and sourness of cheese. Felt like I was transported back to Furano ðŸ˜‹ Try this recipe at your own risk because it was a lot of experimentation and the problem with making bread is the temperature and humidity of your kitchen may affect the results. .
