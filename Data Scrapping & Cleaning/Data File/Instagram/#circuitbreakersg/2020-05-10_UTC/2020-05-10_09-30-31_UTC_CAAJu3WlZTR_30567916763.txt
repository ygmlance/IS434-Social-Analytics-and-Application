#circuitbreakersg day 34

Homemade dumplings for Mother’s Day to be sent to both my mum and my in-laws. 🥟 🥟 .
.
.
The skin was easy but time-consuming to make. For the fillings, I used minced pork, chopped celery, chopped black fungus and chopped water chestnuts. .
.
.
Was cracking my head on what to do for Mother’s Day given the current situation and decided to make some dumplings because they can be kept frozen and steamed to be eaten anytime. .
.
.
And also because dumplings symbolize family reunion (apart from wealth and prosperity). So in a time like this, they represent my 💕 .

Today, I’m grateful for my mother (I’m grateful for her everyday actually) for her unconditional and selfless love for me. ❤️ #gratitudediary .

Here’s wishing all mothers out there a very Happy Mother’s Day! 🌹 May you have a great day with your family! .
