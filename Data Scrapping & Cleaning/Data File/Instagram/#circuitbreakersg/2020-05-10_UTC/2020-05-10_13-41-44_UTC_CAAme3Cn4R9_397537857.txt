Happy Mother's Day to all the great & wonderful mummies & moms-to-be 💐

Baked a naked Cream Cheese Sponge Cake for my mama. She doesn't fancy frosting, so just decorated with some fresh Figs & Blueberries.

Another 3 more weeks and we can all meet our beloved families. Till then, stay safe & stay well 💞
