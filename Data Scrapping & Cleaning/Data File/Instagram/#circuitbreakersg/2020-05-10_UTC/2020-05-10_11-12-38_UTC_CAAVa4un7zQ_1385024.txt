Few weeks back I took 30+ packets of my very expired frozen breastmilk out of the freezer to declutter. I asked B to dump them into the chute because it’s too heartbreaking to bin them myself. ⁣
⁣
Before he left for the rubbish chute, he turn around and said “I probably don’t tell you this often enough. But I really really appreciate you for breastfeeding our two children. You are a great mother.” He then gave me a big hug.⁣
⁣
I wanted to cry as I melted into his embrace. It’s feels so nice to be appreciated. As much as I enjoyed my breastfeeding journeys, there were also many moments that made it so damn hard to go on.⁣

In this special Mothers’ Day, even if you can’t take your wife/mother somewhere fancy. Remember to do something nice and/or simply tell your wife/mother how much you appreciate her. Doing something nice probably don’t cost much, saying something nice is free. But these appreciative gestures are priceless when you do it with your heart.⁣

Thank you hubby and kids for spoiling me today! And HAPPY MOTHERS’ DAY to all the mummies and mummies-to-be in the world!
