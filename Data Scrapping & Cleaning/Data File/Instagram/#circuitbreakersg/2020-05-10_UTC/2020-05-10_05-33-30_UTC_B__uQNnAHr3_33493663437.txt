I used to think that using these ready mixed sauces are unhealthy and one should avoid them. Turns out, of course they are not as healthy as you grow the beans yourselves, but they really do change things up with minimum effort. Especially when you have tummies to fill at home!

Moms are Super busy. So why guilt yourselves? Just use bean paste!

At least healthier than seaweed chicken.
