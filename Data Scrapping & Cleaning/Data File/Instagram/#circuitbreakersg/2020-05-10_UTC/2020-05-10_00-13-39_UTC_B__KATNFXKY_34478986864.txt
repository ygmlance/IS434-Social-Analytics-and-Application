We had a 2-household Mother's Day Zoom dinner party last night with absolutely delicious #Peranakan cuisine from @candlenutsg. Common dishes ordered were the yummy curry chicken, beef rendang and chapchye, in addition we had the satay and (fluffy) chinchalok omelette, while the fam had ngoh hiang, Assam fish and buah keluak fried rice (2nd pic). This was our first experience with Candlenut, and definitely won't be the last! You can order via their website.
