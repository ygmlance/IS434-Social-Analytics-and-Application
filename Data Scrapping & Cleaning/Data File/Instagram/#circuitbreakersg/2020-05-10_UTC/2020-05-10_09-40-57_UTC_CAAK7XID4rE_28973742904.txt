Today is the day where all my cravings are satisfied. Glossy red skin, thin and chewy with generous servings of peanut fillings is one of my favourite traditional@snacks.  Missed patronizing my favourite ang ku kueh stall (Ri Xin Snack Delights) at Maxwell Food Centre after evening gym sessions. It is an assuming stall with the unlit signage, the smiley elderly owner who handmade all these delicious kueh by himself and sells them at very affordable price of 60 cents each. Please support him if you are around the area. 
P/S: The stall only opens at 3pm till late.
