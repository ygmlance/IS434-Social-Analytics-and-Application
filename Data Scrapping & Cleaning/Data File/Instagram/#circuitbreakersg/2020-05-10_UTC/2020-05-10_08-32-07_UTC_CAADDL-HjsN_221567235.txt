Snoozed in and awoke to a Thai lunchtime feast from @bluejasmine.sg and the prettiest hand decorated cookies by the girls. Itâ€™s been a rockinâ€™ Motherâ€™s Day so far, lockdown or not. Hope all the mums out there are having a fabulous day too! ğŸ’•ğŸŒˆğŸ¥‚ğŸŒ·ğŸ¥° (P/S Thank to my cuz @valdemort.w for supplying the timely cookie decorating kit!) #mothersday2020 #sgmums #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
