I started out wanting to make black bean burgers for lunch but I didn’t feel like I had the bandwidth to do something new. So I grabbed @sidecar_sausages beef burgers out of the freezer to defrost.

This is the second time I’ve made these buns and the first after I’ve understood the yudane method better. The recipe is from @dreamersloft17. The dough is wet but with oiling the hands, the buns can be shaped quite easily. Look at the rise of the bun! It made me so happy.

Caramelized onions were just some EVOO, onions and salt.

Pickled beetroot was apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, cloves, sugar, shallots and peppercorn boiled with steamed beetroots.

I first pan fried the burgers and then deglazed with the water and fried the mushrooms with a smidge of salt.

The Mothers Day present I got was peace and quiet to cook with no one underfoot. Times like this reminds me how I actually enjoy cooking.
