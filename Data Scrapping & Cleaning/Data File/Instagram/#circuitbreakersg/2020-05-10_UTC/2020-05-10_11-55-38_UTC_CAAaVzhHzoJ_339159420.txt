#Circuitbreakersg Day 34
.
Throwback to when mum and I  came in First 🏆 at the Winter Olympics!!.... Kiddin 🤣

But truly, mum deserves the Number One spot; she's been this pillar of strength for us as we were growing up, and even now as adults
.
We had a quiet steamboat at home today - Simple, but satisfyingly warm to our stomachs and hearts 💕
.
Here's wishing all mothers, grandmothers and Godmothers a blessed Mother's Day! You certainly deserve a trophy! 💐
