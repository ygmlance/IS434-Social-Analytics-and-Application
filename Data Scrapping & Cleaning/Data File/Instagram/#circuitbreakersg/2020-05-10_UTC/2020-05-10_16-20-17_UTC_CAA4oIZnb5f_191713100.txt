🕢Dinner：
-Homemade Mee Hoon Kueh.
Made my husband favourite mee hoon kueh, aka hand pulled noodle again. 
Knead, Stretch, Pull,and Add whatever ingredients you prefer and you will have yourself a comforting bowl of mee hoon kueh. 
Topped with minced pork and mushroom. Either soup or dry, I loves both. 😬 
let’s Jiak!
