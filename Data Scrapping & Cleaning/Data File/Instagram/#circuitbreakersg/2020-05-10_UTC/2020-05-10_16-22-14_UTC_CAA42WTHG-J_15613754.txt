Happy Mother's Day to my strongest momma. My ambitious attempt to make Poh's inspired Lychee Strawberry Chiffon cake. DELISH-IOUS. Just short of edible flowers that I was hoping to get for the cake decoration. Almost gave up on whipping up the cream - from using thicken cream to whipping cream; from hand beater to electric mixer. All the creams were used up and destroyed as it turned lumpy and watery. Tweak the recipe and use Swiss meringue buttercream method with pantry items (eggs, butter and sugar) instead. I swear to jog at least 5k tomorrow. (This was Poh's recipe from MasterChef S12) #circuitbreakersg day26 #mothersday #ibonappetit #mylollybellykitchen #MasterChefAu #isolife #isolationbaking #quarantineandbake
