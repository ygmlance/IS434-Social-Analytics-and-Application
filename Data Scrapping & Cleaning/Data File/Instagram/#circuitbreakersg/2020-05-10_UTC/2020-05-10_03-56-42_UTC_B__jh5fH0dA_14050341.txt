When ur mom only gives u 20mins to do her makeup

Although its #circuitbreakersg and #stayhomesg go down also need to wear mask. I want her to feel special today ‚ù§ 
Have u tried applying makeup for your mom? U will notice how much she has aged, her wrinkles, spots, sagging skin.. makes u wonder if u have taken care of her well enough.. was she too tired taking care of u and etc... I'm 30 but she still loves me and give me attention like I'm 3

Happy Mothers Day!!! #melListen
