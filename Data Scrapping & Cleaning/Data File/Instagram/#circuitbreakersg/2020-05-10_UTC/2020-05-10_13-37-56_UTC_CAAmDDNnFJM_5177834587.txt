During this Covid-19 Circuit Breaker period, we have no chance for dining in. Been wanting to dine in this Authentic Chinese Indonesian restaurant @kota88restaurant, but it’s located at East Coast and very far from where I stay. So I got this chance today to order online from @grabfoodsg to try their food! ▪️ Nasi Campur Babi - it’s their signature house specialty! It’s like assorted pork with rice (Roast Pork, Char Siew, Braised Pig Ear, Sweet Pork Satay, Siew Mai, Soy Egg and Ngo Hiang)
▪️Kwetiau Goreng Special (Special fried kwetiau with beef, chicken, pork, chinese sausage, fish cake, chye sim and bean sprouts) ▪️ Bee Hoon Goreng Special (Special fried vermicelli noodles with beef, chicken, pork, chinese sausage, chye sim and bean sprouts)
▪️ Pork Kecap Vege Petai (Stir fry pork with Petai beans and soy sauce) “Makan Kenyang, Hati Senang!” It means “Eat until very full, Happy Heart!” ❤️ #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgfoodlover #instagramsg #food #igfoodies #foodgasm #foodiesg #foodie #sgfoodie #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodlovers #igfood #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #kota88restaurant #hidangankota88 #chineseindocuisine #chineseindonesianfood #happymothersday #sunday #weekendmood #orderonline #grabfoodsg #sgfoodhunt #stayhomeforsg #sgunited
