[𝗠𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗗𝗮𝘆] ❤ Mummy's Day in our house is also known as Mummy's Off Day! Not a thing to do, not a finger ☝🏻 to lift. Like how hubby @rupert.gpc puts it; Just eat and relax, think Bruno Mars "🎼 Lazy Song🐵"
.
There wasn't a thing I felt responsible for today. I woke up to breakfast ordered and delivered to the dining table, hubby in his workman shirt mopping the floor 🧹 squeaky clean, Little Boy @thisisleonidasgan 👶🏻 doing his best to impress with smiles, hugs and kisses, pouring me ice cold water plus carrying my heavy laundry bag 🧺 from the master room at level 2 to the laundry room at basement. Not forgetting the incessant "𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐝𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠?" 𝐎𝐫 "𝐃𝐚𝐝𝐝𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐝𝐝𝐲! 𝐌𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐲 𝐭𝐫𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐨𝐤!" from the Boy and the Hubby, everytime I stepped into the kitchen to try and do a little of my mummy duties 😂Too pampered! My heart is full ❤
.
So here I am, middle of the night, Little Boy and hubby asleep, doing a checklist in my IG for all the things accomplished by the 2 Men today -
.
✔️Floor Sweep, Vaccum and Mopped 🧹🧼
.
✔️Laundry Done and folded 👔👗
.
✔️All Meals done and dusted - without my input (ok, I managed to "sneak attack" and did a quick tuna puff 🐟 for everyone when daddy went out to "sneak attack" and got me a tray of sushi"🍣)
.
✔️Kitchen washed and dishes done 🍽️🥄
.
✔️🐱Majimeow's area washed, cleansed and fed - now sleeping near me feet
.
✔️Little Boy 👶🏻 fed and sent to bed 🛌🏻🧸
.
✔️Home facial done 💆🏻‍♀️ cold mask slapped on ❄
.
✔️IG post to document moments like these📱done and relaxing on bed 💖
.
Do I wish for this pampering everyday? Of course I do! But I know I couldn't, because a Mummy's gonna Do what a Mummy's gotta do! And for that! I salutè all the Mummies out there! 365 days a year, 24/7 a week! 🕐
.
As for me, I'm just happy the 2 Men made my day, it's not how often, but how much effort they put in today ... it makes it all worth it. 💪🏼waiting for Mothers' Day 2021! Until then - 🥋🤜🏼💥🤛🏼 ❤
