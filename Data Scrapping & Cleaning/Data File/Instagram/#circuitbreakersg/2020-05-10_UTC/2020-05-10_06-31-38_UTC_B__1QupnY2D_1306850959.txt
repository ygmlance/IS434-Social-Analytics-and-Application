🏟 This is no dress rehearsal for life, this is a live performance- so stop worrying and enjoy the show. 🏟 Today’s quote is so apt for all mothers! Mothers are always worrying that they are not doing a good enough job but really, you are just as inexperienced as your child. So you are all doing a good job. ☺️There is no perfect mother but only the one and best mother to all children. Happy Mother’s Day to all mothers- especially my mother and mother-in-law! Today, it’s back to my roots as I eat Soon Kuehs from a Teochew pastries stall. Pairing with Muah Chee (which I have been craving for a while) and my all time favourite almond paste. Yummy!!! 😋😋😋 Enjoy the weekend! 🤩
