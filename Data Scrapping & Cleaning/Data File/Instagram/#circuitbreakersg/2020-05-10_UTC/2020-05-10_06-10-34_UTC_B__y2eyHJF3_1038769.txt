Happy Motherâ€™s Day. Sometimes we feel like we need a stiff drink. ðŸ˜‚ I donâ€™t usually take alcohol these days but Iâ€™m loving the @raffleshotelsingapore Vesper cocktail handcrafted by Writers Bar. Itâ€™s vodka, gin and Cocchi Americano ($88 per bottle to enjoy at home, probably good for 10 servings). Stir over ice and enjoy with a lemon peel. Iâ€™ve added soursop and passionfruit puree from @dessertgurusg for a tropical twist. So delicious and refreshing. ðŸ˜‹ Now I just need a nice massage...
