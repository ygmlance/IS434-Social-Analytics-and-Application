Lobster ðŸ¦ž tagliatelle by chef Michelle! Made from scratch tagliatelle pasta. Cooked in cherry tomato sauce with a little al dente doneness. Then finish off with the succulent butter-poached lobster tail (has that toing toing texture). Just short of flat leave parsley for that extra flavors... #circuitbreakersg #covid19 #madefromscratch #madewithlove #lobstertagliatelle #lobstertails #homemade #stayhomewithascott
