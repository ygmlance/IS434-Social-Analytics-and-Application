Have been feeling creatively low for  quite some time. So I just picked up my hoop, and threads closed my eyes went through all my travel memories, lavender farms in New Zealand was the first one to come to my mind. I absolutely love love lavender fragrance one of my favorite it is, I literally went crazy when I saw the lavender farms and all the natural products made from it. Still using the essential oil that I got last year. I think It is the most vibrant and good looking flowering plant with so many benefits. While I was thinking about it, I roughly drew these two twigs and embroidered them, and hell ya it was quick and super satisfying. Throwback to the times when we could travel!
