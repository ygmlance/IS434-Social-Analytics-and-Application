"Here's the labour of love from Syncroony. 
This project would not have been made possible without the contributions of talents from the friends who in one way or another have been part of Syncroony. Indeed, we really counted on each other doing this project! More than this gesture of showing our strengths by connecting or helping one another, we want to encourage people to be a source of strength, hope and inspiration to others. If this resonates with you, then we can count on you too."
