Physiotherapist @oliviachongg will be taking the limelight from me with better segmental control of the spine in the glute bridge exercise😅 Weakness in our gluteal muscles can contribute to lower back problems in the long run. Here we will highlight what to look out for during the exercise to strengthen and tone up your buttocks effectively 💪🍑
.
 Additional tips:
💡Make sure the extension movement comes from your hip instead of your back, especially near the end of range
💡Placing your feets too far away from your buttocks will likely trigger more activation from your hamstrings instead
💡Swipe right for band exercise and a picture of an alternate foot positioning, which promote further external rotation of the hip to hit the gluteus medius harder 🆙
.
Beginner tips:
🆕Feet - hip-width apart
🆕Brace your core to prevent arching your back during the exercise
⚠️Seek medical advice first if you have uncontrolled hypertension
