[🌹Mother's Day calls for a homecooked meal prepared with love by her children 👩‍👧💕]
•
Having only cooked cream-based pasta previously, this was the first time cooking Aglio Olio since my mum was craving vegan style dish! Thank goodness, I got rather positive feedback for my first try 🥰
•
Using locally sourced ingredients for seasoning & taste, this includes salt, black pepper, garlic, olive oil, fresh brown mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and spaghetti of your choice, you can stir up a simple yet tasty pasta dish on your own too! 😋🤗
