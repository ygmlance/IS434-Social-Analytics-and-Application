To all mummies, today is your party, so relax and rest at least for a day. It will be a feast for everyone at home, not just for you!⁣

With my mum, we spent our morning work on this Make-It box from @sunteccity and @wob.sg . Yeah! It is Strawberry Lemon tarts! I’m not really like lemon but I love strawberry! 😄 I made them all with a little assist from my mom. Hope she enjoy the lemon tart for her afternoon tea break later. ⁣
