A simple , relaxing, calming and easy art activity - Zentangle,  to fuel my soul with creativity.  Love the beauty in Zentangle, is unplannedï¼Œjust go with the flow, mistake is no mistake, they are opportunities to create something new ... With busy schedule, I missed those pauses in my life where I spend time doing interesting things that nourish my soul. Decide, shall not wait ... Turn on the relaxing music and air conditioning, make a cup of tea or coffee, with a pen and a small square piece of paper, just draw repeated pattern. So therapeutic and enjoy the moments of joy! 
Self taught and so it is simple and easy to learn ...Doing is easy, thinking make it hard ... #stayhomeforsg #stayhomesg #stayhome #zentangle #art #singapore #circuitbreakersg #zenart #mandala #draw #peace
