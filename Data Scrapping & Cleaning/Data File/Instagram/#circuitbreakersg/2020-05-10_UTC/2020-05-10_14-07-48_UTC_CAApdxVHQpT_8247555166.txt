Mother’s Day dinner from @boufesg! 🍴
✨
Ordered the Korean army stew, homemade chicken rendang nasi lemak, kampung style chicken satay and barley and beancurd skin dessert! They were not too bad, but we thought the rice and meat for the satay were a little too tough! 🥘🍲
✨
Always wanted to try the food here but sadly this might be my first and last time as their last day of operations is 30 June 2020. They’re offering a night market style menu currently during the CB. Thus various food from different cuisines are being offered. Self collection and deliveries are available! ✅
✨
Have a restful night all! 🌙
