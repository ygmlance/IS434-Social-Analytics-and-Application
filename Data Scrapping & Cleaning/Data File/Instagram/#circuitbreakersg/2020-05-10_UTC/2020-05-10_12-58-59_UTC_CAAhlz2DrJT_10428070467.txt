â˜†Genki Mamaâ˜†
To all my invited participants: A big THANK YOU to all of you for joining my "Genki Mama" Mother's Day Workshop! A mother gives life and nurtures and all of you are like Heart In Hand Atelier's mum who supported and nurtured my new life as a pastel artist!

Genki Mama means Healthy Mum - I hope everyone is energised after attending this workshop! I love all the improvisations you all have made and I love that many of you joined in with your loved ones too!

This piece of artwork "My Clover" holds a special meaning to me - it was the first artwork I designed and the first public workshop I conducted for my beloved PSG in 2019 for Mother-Child Nagomi Art bonding session. I'll especially like to give thanks to my mentor Jess, my PSG kakis (esp Bea & Kende) and not forgetting my good friend Feiling who believed in me more than I believed myself.

Thank you ladies and here's wishing one and all:

HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!
