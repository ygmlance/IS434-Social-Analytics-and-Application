10 May 2020 : Blessed to celebrate my 4th Mothers’ Day with my small family. Thank You Lord ❤️🙏🏻

Thanks to Covid-19 & Circuit Breaker, I have no Mothers’ Day presents from Faith (& the school) 😭😭😭 Hahaha but it’s ok la, I’m well-trained by the heartless hub not to expect presents during special occasions for over a decade #KNN #一根草一朵野花都没有 🙄

Faith is a very sweet daughter. She made sure she drew something for me too this morning when I asked her to draw something for her 婆婆 (We were gg to have a Video Call with her grandparents, Aunt & cousins in the afternoon). 婆婆 gets 2 flowers & 2 balloons while Mama gets an abstract art-piece. 😂

Mama Teo is proud to NUA for this year’s Mothers’ Day. 罢工成功! Settled lunch & dinner via food delivery (Lu Ding Ji & Spruce); persisted in not doing any chores; 5min masking while Papa showered Faith. 🥰

Hoping that we can gai gai more freely for Mothers’ Day 2021... that Covid-19 will be controlled by then. In times like this, a mother truly only wishes for everyone in the family to be healthy. ❤️
