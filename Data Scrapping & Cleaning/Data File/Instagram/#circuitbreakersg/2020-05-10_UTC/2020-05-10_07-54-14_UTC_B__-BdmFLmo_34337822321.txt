I took a picture of my class doing the teaser on the fitness ball because i wanted them to feel proud of being able to conquer the challenging move, with the ball carrying the weight of their legs. Teaser is an intermediate Pilates move and the law of physics makes it hard to balance your pelvis against the uneven levers of your legs and hands. So modifying with a fitball allows us to achieve the essence of the move still. What other modifications have you taught for the teaser?
