Art piece: Interlock-down house

Artist: Mireya Wei, 3 yrs old

Description: The 2 interlocking colours represent how both communities need to support each other to build a strong and beautiful home. If one community collapses, the whole building collapses. Thank you migrant workers for building our homes. Stay safe and get well soon! #art4SGMW
