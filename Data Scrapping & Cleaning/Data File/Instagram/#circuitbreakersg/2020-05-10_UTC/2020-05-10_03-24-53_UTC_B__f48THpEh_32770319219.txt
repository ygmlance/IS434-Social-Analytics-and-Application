I am a Sovereign. I am “We the People”. At moments this week felt like we were beginning to lose the plot. We watched the people of other nations venture out of their homes. Some cautiously, and others recklessly. We wondered when our turn would come.

It’s beginning to dawn on us that life isn’t going back to normal. Not for a while. We’re going to be living in an alternate reality. The ‘New Normal’. Are we ready to re-emerge?
