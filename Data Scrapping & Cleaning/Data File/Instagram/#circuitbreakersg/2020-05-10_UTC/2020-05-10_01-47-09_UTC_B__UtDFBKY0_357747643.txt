Mother’s Day 2020
Happy Mother’s Day. Thank you mum for cooking healthy meals for lunch and fetching me from the office after office hours by car. I appreciate my mum to help with household chores and cook healthy and delicious dishes when I am on holidays and taking leaves from the office. Feeling Sad not to eat at our favourite Indonesian restaurant at Lucky Plaza due to Circuit breaker.
