Week 3 of HBL with me going back to work just flew by. When we find ourselves in situations where we are being stretched to the max, that’s when we truly experience “My grace is sufficient for you.” Really love the Tiny Tots craft today - a phone with emojis! So timely as we’ve been exploring emotions lately and both girls really love “The Feelings Song” in Youtube that’s so soothing and comforting. Ollie loves it so much she would request for it to be sung at bedtime using the phrase “feel happy”. Nat would just ask me to play it from my phone😂. For Nat, we have been discussing how to manage feelings - 🎵 u might feel many different feelings, and they’re all ok 🎵, BUT we need to be careful how we act on those feelings. She will tell me, “u can be angry, it’s ok, but don’t throw things. Do the right thing”. I love to see how she is learning...it’s not perfect, emotions still overrule behavior often and it’s always just debriefing again and again. But c’mon, we see that even in adults😆. With God in the picture however, it’s a whole different ballgame. Whatever emotion she may have, what a privilege it is to be able to bring it to God and He understands. Ollie on the other hand is learning to emote. She is learning happy, sad and mad...and it’s always so comical to see her make faces. As an adult, I feel like even I am learning to be more in touch with my emotions and to find the right ways to act on those feelings. #learningonacloud #hbl #circuitbreakersg #learningaboutemotions #fourgoingonfive #20monthsold
