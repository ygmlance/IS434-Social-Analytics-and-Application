Today we will look at another essential component of exterior Feng Shui the Mountain. As of Singapore, we do not possess any huge mountain that what other country has. So we will be looking at the high and low of the ground to determine which direction of your unit surrounding is considerate higher or lower if we are looking at another country with an actual mountain that having it there is ideal. 
With that information, we can identify the potential of the unit itself.  Some of the directions that are ideal to have Mountain are North and Southwest. 
Does your unit have what it take to bring you good intellectual skill and Nobleman Luck? To find out more do leave us a comment or drop us a DM.
