Sunday Brunch, was a classic duo of what used to be called Char Kuay, but is now commonly called Chye Tow Kuay, or Fried Carrot Cake. This carrot cake base was bought from the market, in the form of a chilled block. I cut it into 2 different sizes, chunky and small cubes, and fried the lot over high heat in lard, seasoned with a few dashes of fish sauce, and a liberal sprinkling of salty preserved turnip (Kiam Chye Poh). I also added a dried shrimp chilli sauce, which i diluted, for easier mixing. When the carrot cake was well coated and sufficiently cooked, i added in some beaten eggs and allowed it to set, and preferably crisp up a little. I plated the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù half, and added sweet dark sauce, chopping the carrot cake into smaller pieces as i mixed in the sauce, and allowing everything to caramelise and crisp up a bit. Both were served with a sprinkling of chopped spring onions. Tasty and satisfying! üòã #charkway #chyetowkway #blackandwhite #teochewfood #teochewcuisine #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #sundaybrunch #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
