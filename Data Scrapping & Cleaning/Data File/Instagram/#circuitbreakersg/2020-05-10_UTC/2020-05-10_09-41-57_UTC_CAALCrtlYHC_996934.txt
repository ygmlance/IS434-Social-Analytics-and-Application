#circuitbreakerday34 x #happymothersday2020 x #sunnywithachanceofmeatballs // #ikeameatballs from the recipe @ikeauk (+ a pinch of nutmeg and allspice)! Finally with the right proportion of broccoli imho, but alas not nearly enough cream sauce for everyone.

Today, we thanked mothers for their mothering, and also God for making them mothers in the first place.

I’ve yet to find a #mothersday card with #1timothy215 hand-lettered and decorated with assorted florals. But whatever is the right interpretation of that verse (and the context seems to work against the popular evangelical one of salvation through the birth of Jesus), it’s hard not to thank God for the virgin conception and birth of that one child, the offspring of Eve who would decisively crush the head of the evil serpent (Genesis 3:15).
.
.
We thank God because He is sovereign over “natural” conception and births, as well as “unnatural” conception and births (fulfilments of God’s promises ✨ to these women), eg of the latter:
• the very old and barren Sarah (Gen 11:30, 21:1-7) giving birth to Issac, and Elizabeth to John the Baptist (Luke 1);
• the barren Rebecca (Gen 25:21) to Esau and Jacob, Leah (Gen 29:31) to Reuben, Rachel (Gen 30:22) to Joseph, etc.
.
.
And there’s more - we too are “unnaturally” conceived #childrenofthepromise ✨:
“Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman...the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise ✨ ...these women are two covenants...Hagar...corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free✨, and she is our mother. For it is written, "Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labour! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband." Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise✨...what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman✨."
So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman✨. (#Galatians4).
