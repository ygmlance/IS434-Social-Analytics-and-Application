Awaken at 700am by the doorbell for a special delivery of 3 live #crabs this #stayhomeforsg period. Though smaller in size, these babies seem pretty heavy when I took them over. And when I cut them up, boy was I in for a surprise. All fat and full of #roe Wanted to steam them but since there has been a craving for #chillicrab when I first bought the #straitsstory #chillicrabpaste at the start of the #circuitbreakersg period, so decided to use these crabs for a #homecooked #chillicrabðŸ¦€ Just clean and cook with the ingredients as shown. Best paired with #mantou #yumz
