Charlie Rouse - Bossa Nova Bacchanal, 1962. This was recorded the same year as Jazz Samba which sparked the Brazilian influence on jazz. But unlike the Getz-Byrd project, this album is still heavy on American hard bop with Caribbean and Brazil thrown in. #kennyburrell is the big name guitarist on this set delivering that Latin bossa feel, backed by #williebobo and #potatovaldez on percussion. It’s a very different bossa from the Getz-Byrd/Gilberto soft west coast jazz. This is heavier, more upbeat, but nonetheless great stuff. And there’s this thing about funky coloured vinyl. Does it have a place in jazz? My partner definitely thinks so! This is a 2018 VMP 45rpm x 2LP reissue and it sounds out of this world!
