Being a mother is wonderful, blessed and loved. Giving birth and raising a child are incredible experiences that will last a lifetime. I'm so grateful and thankful that I can be one, which I can never ask for. I know I'm not the best mom ever but I will work hard to be a great mom for Roxanne. To all mothers, I wish you great strength and much happiness. Happy Mother‚Äôs Day! üíê

P/S: Thanks hub for ordering my favourite food for the Mother's Day celebration and my sis @sw_misstan for getting the cakes for me. ‚ù§Ô∏è
