Hand made ingredients that are all lightly cooked from @loveufoodsg . Bought for a family of 4 and the bill barely made it to $30. Goodness can be inexpensive.

This time round i gobbled the hot food inside my car. It was so delish that i felt all my wishes for 2020 have came true.
 #dontblametarpaofoodforbeingnotnice If you can only accept hot food and no less, then eat inside your car once you picked it up. It is a heavenly experience chomping down while staring at empty streets, cultivating #gratitude
