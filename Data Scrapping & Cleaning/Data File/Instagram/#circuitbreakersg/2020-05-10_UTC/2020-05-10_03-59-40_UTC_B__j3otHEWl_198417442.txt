ðŸ’–Black Carrot CakeðŸ’–
Wanted to try baking burnt cheesecake initially but canâ€™t find cake flour and cream cheese for weeks... Only left with rice flour and tapioca flour on NTUC shelves so can only make Chinese kueh. 
Still had leftover steamed carrot cake so whipped up black carrot cake today for mum! ðŸ¤— Actually my mum loves the black one more. But we donâ€™t have black sauce at home. Used the sweet black sauce from the soon kueh she had for breakfast. Look at amount of eggs. ðŸ¤ª Sweetness from black sauce with spiciness from homemade sambal chilli and savouriness from chai po. Om-nom-nom. ðŸ˜‹
