Day 33. Woke up to this sight and the clouds resembled waves approaching the shore. Missing all the wonderful outdoor sites. Brunch - linguine in tomato sauce with grilled salmon for Missy. Lunch for parents - cooked Dad's fav mushroom risotto since he has returned home and to celebrate Mother's Day with Mum. Took a break from cooking as we enjoyed takeawat dinner. Tomorrow is the start of week 2 May school holidays! #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #instadaily
