🦀CB Day34 - Dinner Time🦀
.
It's Mother's Day, so I took over the kitchen for dinner. .
The Ginger Scallion Snow Crab 🦀 is to celebrate with my Mum 👩🏻‍🦱
.
But hor... ... Mum feels the ginger is too spicy coz she said I bought "bentong ginger"... ... 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
.
To me every ginger is the same... ... Now I learn something... ...
