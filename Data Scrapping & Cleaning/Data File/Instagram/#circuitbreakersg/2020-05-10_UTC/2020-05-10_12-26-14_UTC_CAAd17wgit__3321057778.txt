Things to do with the kids #51

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome

That saying, "Wherever I lay my mat, that's my home." "Not sure why the mat is on the bench, but never mind." "Titus, they're doing haircuts." "Don't let them shave my fur, Vanilla." "Titus, you're a cat, they won't do that." "Vanilla, they gave me the chop once, there's no stopping them" "Titus, this #stayathome thing is making you paranoid." "Vanilla, I'm not paranoid, I'm just being careful." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
