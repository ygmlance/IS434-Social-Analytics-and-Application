Blessed Mother’s Day! Chiffon Cake baked for yesterday’s filming at Mediacorp. Happy to be invited by Channel 8 to share about baking on their ongoing variety show《健康那些事- Get Fit With Me》. This meaningful program is specially tailored during COVID-19 to educate and entertain audience especially elderly when everyone has to stay home.

Due to the circuit breaker & social distancing measures, I’m unable to share photos of the filming. Do not worry, everyone on set wears a mask and only takes it off during filming. We also comply with the social distancing rule and stand apart from one another. .
