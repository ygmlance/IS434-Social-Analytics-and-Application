Peach gum dessert ( 桃胶糖水 ）
With dried longans, red dates, white fungus n wolfberries .

Made this refreshing n nourishing dessert yesterday. Hubby n 2 girls helped to remove impurities while I’m resting 😆 .

Brought some over to my mum n I was quite surprised that she loves it. Even last night she still mentioned how delicious the Peach Gum was 🥰 #爱心甜汤 .

Happy Mother’s Day to all mommies out there. Have a fabulous day filled with ❤️ .
