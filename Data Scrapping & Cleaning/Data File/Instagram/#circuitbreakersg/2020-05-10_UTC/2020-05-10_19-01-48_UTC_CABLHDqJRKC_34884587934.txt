Who knew human interaction from a stranger would bring you so much joy. 🤦🏻‍♀️ #monsteraadansonii #swisscheeseplant #pothos #epipremnumaureum #epipremnummarblequeen #epipremnumnjoy #epipremnumneon #sansiviera #snakeplant #wanderingjew #tradescantiafluminensisvariegata #plantinthetimeofcovid #circuitbreakersg
