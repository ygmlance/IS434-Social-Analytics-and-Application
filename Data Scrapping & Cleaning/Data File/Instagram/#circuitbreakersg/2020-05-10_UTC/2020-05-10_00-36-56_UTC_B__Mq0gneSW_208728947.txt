We may not control the things that happen but we can decide not to be reduced by them. Despite we couldn’t head out, thanks for bringing Mother’s Day celebration to me.

Love grows by giving and these few weeks of facing each other 24/7 only make me more grateful for what I have. You never held back in getting the dirty work done and you are always right here with me in the trenches. May we continue to grow ever in fortitude and compassion. Thanks for all the love!❤️ #stayunited #sgunited #mothersday #sgigfoodies #sgigfood #stayhomesg #circuitbreakersg #mothersdaysg
