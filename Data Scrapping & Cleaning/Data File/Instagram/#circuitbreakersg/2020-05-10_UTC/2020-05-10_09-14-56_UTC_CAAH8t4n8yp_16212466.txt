Happy Mother's Day to all Moms! ❤️⁣

Helped my daughter cook Red Wine Lees Chicken with Korean glass noodles for mommy as this is one of her favourite home-cooked chicken dishes.😋 ⁣

Suddenly a thought came, I need to quickly teach my daughter some cooking so that I can relax on Father's Day! Ya! 😎
