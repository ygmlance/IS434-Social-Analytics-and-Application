Happy Mother's Day to all Mummies in the world! ❤
Ordered Kagoshima Style Braised Pork Cartilage & Wontons in Fish Soup with Mixian Set (come with a drink) from @tsuiwahsingapore to pamper ourselves on a Sunday. Sad that Crispy Bun with Condensed Milk is sold out when i have craving for that ☹. Tried ordering for lunch via Grabfood but was cancelled by the restaurant after an hour wait - we were rather upset as it was rather late already. Not giving up, we tried again for dinner and luckily the order was not cancelled last min! 
Satisfy with the meal but it will be great if the crispy bun are still available!
