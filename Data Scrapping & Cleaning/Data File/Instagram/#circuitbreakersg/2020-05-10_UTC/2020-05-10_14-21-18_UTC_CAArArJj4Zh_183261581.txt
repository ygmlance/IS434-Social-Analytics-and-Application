#circuitbreakersg day 34
Happy Mother’s Day to me!😍 Flowers from the Kwalets and the son in law🥰
Thousand gold hand made some pancake from scratch.... took her many many mins to make the dough, knead, roll, flatten and slowly pan fried it... texture like a roti prata with layers😍. Youngest kwalet made the other stack.  Saccharine and carb loading.... everything durian from Sindy Durians (except the real thing😜), cinnamon roll from Burnt Ends, Apple Cake from Lokal and homebaked cookies with Lotus cookie crunch from a niece🥰😍
Lunch was fish soup n pancakes😃
