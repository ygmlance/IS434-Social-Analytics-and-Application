💖Korean Food from @ajummasg💖
Have been having Korean food for all my meals this weekend. 🤣 Mum saw the Korean ginseng chicken soup I had like two weekends ago and wanted to try. So I ordered two portions for #mothersday celebration tonight. 🤗 ✅Korean Ginseng Chicken
Look at how generous the size of chicken is. It’s supposed to be a whole spring chicken but looks way bigger than that? 😍

The meat is so soft kind that it falls of the bone and bone also disintegrates to the touch. 👍
✅Kimchi Pancake
Wanted to try their kimchi pancake so ordered to share this time. The edges were nice and crispy but I found the centre too soft and mushy like I cannot cut properly into pizza slices. More towards tangy kimchi than spicy. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Came with free sides for this mother’s day weekend! Fried dumplings and fried chicken tteokbokki! Quite a lot considering it is free. Thanks @ajummasg! 💓
✅Fried Pork Dumpling
The whole dumpling is like packed with moist minced pork and chives.
✅Fried Chicken Tteokbokki
Sweet gochujang sauce. Would prefer it to be spicier like the yangnyeom sauce. But my grandparents enjoyed it sweet. The tteokbokki was chewy but a little too hard. My grandparents found it hard to chew.
Highly recommend their Ginseng Chicken Soup! 💯
