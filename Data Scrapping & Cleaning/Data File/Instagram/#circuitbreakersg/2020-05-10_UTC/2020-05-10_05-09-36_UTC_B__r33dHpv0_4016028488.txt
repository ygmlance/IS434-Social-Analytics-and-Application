Happy Mother’s Day! A personal shout out to the woman who made me the person I am today. Like many of you, I am  not able to be with my mother today. But being in a different time zone has never been a problem for us. You are still the first person I call when I have something happy, sad and everything in between to talk about. Happy Mother’s Day to all the wonderful mums out there that shape us to being a better person.
