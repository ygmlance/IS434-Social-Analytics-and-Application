Made this DIY roller blend last night ðŸ’›
.
.
Above Wellness Line roller blend. I started to use this since late Jan, and made it a habit to apply everyday. One of my fave blends hands down!!
.
.
Above Wellness Line recipe 
6 drops of Thieves
4 drops of Lemon
4 drops of Frankincense (Either Frank or Oregano)
2 drops of Oregano (You can leave this out, too. It can feel a bit spicy on the skin, but I like it)
*this is recipe for adult use. for kids, follow dilution chart as guide
.
.
Mix & Blend --> Simply roll on the length of your spine or the base of the spine, and also the soles of your feet before bed and before you leave the house during the day.
.
.
Oils applied along the spine helps to boost the immune system as it releases toxins and kills viruses and bacteria that have accumulated along the spine.
.
.
So easy to blend, easier to apply ðŸ’ž
