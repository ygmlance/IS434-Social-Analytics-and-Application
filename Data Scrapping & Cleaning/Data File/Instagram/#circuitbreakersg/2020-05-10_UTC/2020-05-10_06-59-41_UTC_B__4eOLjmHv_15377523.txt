Shall we go shopping 👜 when we are able to, Ah ma and Po Po? A blessed and happy (Grand)Mother’s Day to my dearest Ah ma, Po Po, Ee Ee @fefe_at_play , kim kim LY and all my favourite aunties and @clarisaphobia @yobananagirl @reizz to name a few. .
I asked Tyra what did she want to send to Ah ma and Popo for Grandmother’s Day and she said a bag! And so... #Circuitbreakersg mode had us resort to using materials that we could find at home. We recycled cardboard, cut and painted two handbags and recycled old ribbons as the bag straps, for her ah ma and po po, all by herself. We also used the plastic egg crate as a paint palette. Teaching Tyra the virtue of #RECYCLING from young.
Swipe 👈🏻 to see more videos on each step of her art and craft work towards completion. Can’t be more proud of her; her patience and perseverance to want to hand-make something for her grams.🙏🏻 I believe that Tyra and on behalf of Tasha, will like to thank her Ah ma and popo, for their love and care. To all mummies, A BLESSED MOTHER’s DAY again!🌷♥️
