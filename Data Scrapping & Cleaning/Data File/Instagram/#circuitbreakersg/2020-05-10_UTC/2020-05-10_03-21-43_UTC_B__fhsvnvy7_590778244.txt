How lucky am I to have all my babies with me on Mother’s Day for the first time since 2016? And thank you to my darling @lilachappell for taking on the challenge to re-create @burntends_sg famous #crackbuns. Sorry Burnt Ends - I’ll keep ordering your amazing vanilla donuts though! @oliviiachappell @jonosgc #cinnamonrolls #homemadecinnamonrolls #homebaking #lockdownbaking #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #singaporescene #mothersday
