CB DAY 35 -

MOTHER'S DAY

Woke up this morning and pleasantly surprised by this baby boy with the card he made with his daddy and the flower cup I made with him over zoom session with his school. 😍

The toys I ordered from toysrus came too! Haha so it was more like children's day. But wells, as long as the kid is happy, I am happy. 💕
