Day 34 of #CircuitBreakerSg
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gooooood morning everyone! Happy Sunday and Happy Motherâ€™s Day!

A nice fry up always puts us in a good mood. Costs a lot at cafes but is pretty simple to cobble together. Special mention to the chicken sausages from @sadia.sg. They now have a whole range of frozen ready meals. Check out my previous posts for them too. And proud of my home made bread!
