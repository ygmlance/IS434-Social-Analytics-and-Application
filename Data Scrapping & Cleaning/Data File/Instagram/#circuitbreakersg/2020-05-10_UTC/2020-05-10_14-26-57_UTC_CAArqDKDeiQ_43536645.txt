Circuit Breaker Day 34: These days, I have an average of 7-8 hours of sleep daily; exercise at least 3x per week; cook regularly; bake a little; do more housework; and learn how to shop on Taobao. Itâ€™s not all bad for me.  #stayhomeforsg #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakersgchallenge #sgunited #staypositive
