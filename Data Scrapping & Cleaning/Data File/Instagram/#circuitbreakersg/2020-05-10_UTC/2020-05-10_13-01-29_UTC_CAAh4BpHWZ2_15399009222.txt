Meet the little residents in the half-star roof dormitory: •old wise mr cloud who needs a walking stick but stays on the highest level •moon prick with a pointy end who wonder why he has sucky neighbours •spotty who couldn't care less about all his new zits which are about to pop (again) •conjoined twins with the biggest heart (yes they share one) and also the longest legs so they occupy 2 of the 4 storeys in the dormitory

I think it's the first and last time you'll see them.
