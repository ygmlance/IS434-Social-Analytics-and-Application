Happy Mother’s Day to my best Mummy in the world, and also to all the 伟大的妈妈! Thanks super Mum for always wanting nothing but the best for me! ❤️

This year, I made a pandan kaya fudge cake from scratch for her, from baking of the pandan ogura cake to cooking of the kaya fudge layer and then assembling the cake. Decorated the exterior of the cake with desiccated coconut and dried rose petals that I got from @scoopwholefoods_sg. As I could not find any Mother’s Day cake topper, I decided to do it myself. Dug out my calligraphy pens and some heart shaped sticky notes, and voila done! Luckily my calligraphy skills have not gone rusty! 🎨

Had this idea of making this cake as she always likes the one from Bengawan Solo. But my version is free from artificial colourings and flavourings, and I used the super light coconut milk from @ayambrandsg, definitely healthier. Her good health is the best gift for me! It’s my first attempt so aesthetic wise it may not be perfect. But it’s the thought that counts right? 😜

For the pandan ogura cake, the recipe is referenced from @honeybeesweets.sg. For the kaya fudge layer, it’s referenced from @phay_shing. To be honest, I’ve never thought that I can assemble a cake like this myself. Really got to thank @honeybeesweets.sg for sharing her cooking and baking tutorials so generously that motivate and inspire me along the way. If you never try, you never know! 💪🏻

Also entering this for the Mother’s Day contest of @luzerneglobal. Posted the details on my stories and you can check out their latest post for more information! Featuring the plate from their Tin Tin collection. I’m a huge fan of their tableware for their designs as well as quality. Entering the contest so I can do more food photography with more tableware if I win! 🍽 #stayhomewithluzerne
