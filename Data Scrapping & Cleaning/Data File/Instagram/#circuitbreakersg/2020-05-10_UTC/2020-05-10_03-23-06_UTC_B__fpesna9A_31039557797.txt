■ The Z-Press is a great way to target the shoulders, whilst giving the core muscles a good workout. 
By having the legs straight out in front of you, you remove the body's ability to use the legs against the floor as stabilizers. Thereby forcing you to engage the core muscles more.
To further increase the stability challenge, you may choose to do this unilaterally. 
Check out the demo. Try it out and let me know how it goes! And as usual, dont forget to warm up and cool down. .
■ How?
- Sit on the ground, with legs straight out in front
- Raise the dumbbells to the shoulder (neutral grip) *you may use kettlebells as well
- Keep the back neutral, neither flexed nor hyper extended
- Tighten your core muscles, engage scapular muscles
- Push dumbbells vertically up and lower back to shoulder, in a controlled manner .
