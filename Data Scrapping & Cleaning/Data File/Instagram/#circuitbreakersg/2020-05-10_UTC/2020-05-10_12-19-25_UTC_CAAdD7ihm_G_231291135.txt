Thank you @russian_legion for giving us a preview of their winning paintball workouts this weekend on @paintballersworld. The workouts they led felt like restarting the paintball engine in us and bringing us back to the details of competition paintball reminding our muscles and minds that every little mistake can cost us the point.
P.S. At the end of the session, there was a familiar smell from my elbow pads.. haha... ðŸ˜… Haven't had that smell for more than a month now... haha... #russianlegion #paintballersworld #pbw #paintball  #asiapaintball #girlswhoplaypaintball #singaporepaintball #singapore #circuitbreakersg #covid19 #ilovesingapore #singapore
