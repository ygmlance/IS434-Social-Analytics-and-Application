I have one child who overwhelms me with 5 kids' worth of love. 
Happy Mother's Day to me... impressed by the effort though I actually prefer she kick her tantrum-throwing ways than produce so many cards for me. 
And as tradition would have it, somehow I would still have to get angry once on this day.
