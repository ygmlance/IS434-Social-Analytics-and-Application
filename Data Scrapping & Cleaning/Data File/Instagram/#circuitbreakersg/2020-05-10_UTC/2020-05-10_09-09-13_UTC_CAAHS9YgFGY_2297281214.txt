A little more hard working on "circuit breaker" day 34... I decided to try making some chee cheong fun (steamed rice noodle rolls)... As a child, my mum would pick up a slab of chee cheong fun with dried shrimp and spring onion from the local Asian grocery store in Chinatown, Melbourne... She would steam it up at home and it was one of my favourite things to eat with a bit of soy sauce and sesame oil!  In recent years, I've noticed they've gotten stingy with the dried shrimp and it just doesn't taste the same when there's not enough dried shrimp... Solution?  Make my own!
Since it's Mother's Day (even though mum is not here to taste my chee cheong fun), I made some with:
- prawn and coriander
- dried shrimp and coriander
- dried shrimp, wood ear mushroom and coriander
Why did I use coriander?  1. I love coriander and 2. the supermarket had run out of spring onion, so I had no choice but to buy some of @iamivanlau's dastardly enemy! ü§£
Although, thicker than what I would have liked, the chee cheong fun turned out pretty well... Now, I'm on a mission to perfect it so that it's a lot smoother... Stay tuned for more chee cheong fun adventures! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
