Fried noodle
📝I like fried noodles with crunch texture. So will use king oyster mushroom and black fungus. You can use any mushrooms as you like
📝Replace bean sprouts with shredded carrot is an option
📝Always prefer dried black fungus than soft one readily sold in the market because of the crunchiness. Just need to soak for 30 minutes before use or overnight is fine
📝Soak koka noodles in water for 10 minutes before use

ℹ️the portion I showed is for 4 servings
