Mothers are the heart of a family.
.
Mum was also the barometer & thermostat at home, tempering Dad’s non-negotiable rules with quiet diplomacy when we were growing up.
.
She knew we were all stretching our wings to fly, and she let us.
.
But even she wouldn’t have known how far we’d fly. This was right after my brother’s wedding in Indonesia.
.
I hope we’ve made her proud.❤️
.
Happy Mother’s Day, everyone. Kiss your mum for us.💋
