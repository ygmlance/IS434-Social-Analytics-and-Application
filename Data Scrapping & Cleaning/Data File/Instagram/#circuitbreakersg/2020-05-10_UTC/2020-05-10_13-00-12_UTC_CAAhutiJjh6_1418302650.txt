Did a special finale to Todrick Hall’s #maskglovessoapscrubs for all the mummies in my #zumbavirtualclass today, depicting the #storyofourlives as #mothers, be it #stayhomemums or #workingmums (with my mop, brooms and Febreeze in tow). I hope it brought some #funandlaughter to them. The #unconditionallove❤️ we have for our families will always power us to push through no matter how tough life can get. Let’s continue to #jiayou! And special mention to my bro @gohbhd for #sharingthestage with me, nice to have a change of face.
