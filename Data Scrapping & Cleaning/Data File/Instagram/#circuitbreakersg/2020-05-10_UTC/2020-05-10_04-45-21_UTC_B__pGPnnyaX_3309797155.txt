🍴 Salmon Rice with Mixed Peas, Aussie Baby Cucumber 🥒and organic Doumiao from my garden. .

I’ve never really liked Salmon that much previously. But I fell in love with it when my mum pan fried it for me when I was younger. Thanks mum for the effort you put in for us. Happy Mother’s Day! .
Now it’s my turn to prepare for my baby. .
Mint plant at home going bald from all snipping I did at every meal! 😂 .
