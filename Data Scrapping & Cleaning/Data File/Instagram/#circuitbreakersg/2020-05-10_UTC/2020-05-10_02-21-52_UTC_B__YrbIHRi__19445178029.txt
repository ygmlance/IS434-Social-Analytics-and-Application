To be honest, I’ll pretty excited and the same time nervous about the post-Covid-19 times. Will a financial famine be coming? Are we really going to have immunity passports? Will humanity starts to value things which we once overlooked? Although there are people who suffer during this crisis, there are those who ride on this opportunity and rise. Time and time again, it’s resilience, adaptability and creativity that keeps us going. But how far can we go? I often wonder if there is a tipping point. .
