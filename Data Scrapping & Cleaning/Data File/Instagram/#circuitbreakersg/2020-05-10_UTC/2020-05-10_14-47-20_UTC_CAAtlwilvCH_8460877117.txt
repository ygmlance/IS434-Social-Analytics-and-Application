Not the regular kind of push ups we are all used to these scapula push ups help strengthen our rotator cuff muscles and keep our shoulders and mid back healthy! They target the serratus anterior muscle which helps with shoulder blade movement as well as enforcing external rotation to keep our shoulders bulletproof. 
Make sure you arenâ€™t shrugging your shoulders, squeeze your shoulder blades down and back and then pushing them forwards and away from your arms. Try to keep the elbow creases facing front to open up the chest!
