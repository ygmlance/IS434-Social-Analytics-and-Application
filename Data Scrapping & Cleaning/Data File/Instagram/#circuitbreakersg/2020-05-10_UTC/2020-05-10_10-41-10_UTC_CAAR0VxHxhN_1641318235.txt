Finally received my #mothersdaycards from my koalas 😝🐨🐨⁣
⁣
They had their zoom art classes with @muzartsingapore on Friday but refused to show me their final work until today 🤪 DIY Mother's Day BOOKS to be precise! 🤩 Little booklets binded Japanese accounting book style, with pages filled up with different things they depicted of me, using various art genre and media. How lovely are these!⁣ 💞

MuzArt is an art enrichment centre that offers far more than run-of-the-mill art classes.⁣ Their classes are specially designed to arouse and sustain children's interest in art in a fun and interactive way. At MuzArt, the emphasis is not on the result but rather on the process by which children become confident learners with⁣ high emotional intelligence. MuzArt teachers equip children not only with art skills, but also with key life skills, by incorporating work that impacts their behaviour and ethics.⁣
