Finally, Homebased Learning #HBL came to an end last week and mid-year holidays commenced earlier.

Regardless, daily revision goes on as the elder is taking his PSLE and the younger needs her engine to be constantly moving before it gets rusty, learnt from past experiences.

I have friends asking me if there is any platform for revision and I am glad to share that @mceducation is offering FREE ACCESS to its home-based learning app, Math Buddies until this month end! This has started since April but I bo eng to share until now (still bo eng ok)! I am still figuring out Vera's language to make her understand certain concepts, meanwhile she is taking Math Buddies quite well.

@mceducation is the leading education provider in Singapore and one of the key publishers of Maths Textbooks. The Math Buddies app is built to support ALL primary school students in Singapore.

The Math Buddies app will enable our primary school children:
👉🏻 To follow and LEARN based on the Singapore maths curriculum.
👉🏻 To pace himself/herself in learning and encourages self-GUIDED LEARNING.
👉🏻 To utilise VIRTUAL MANIPULATIVES to aid concept visualisation. This is very important for a visual learner like her.
