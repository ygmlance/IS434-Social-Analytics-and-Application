Mother's Day ðŸ¥³ but make it socially distanced! #stayhome
â €
Entering my 8th year as a mom, this year's Mother's Day is one to remember, even though every day has been the same for the past few months.
â €
Here in this corner, I'm grateful for my children and husband for giving me space to write, coach, conduct webinars, zoom meetings, interviews, and attend a Mother's Day lunch party, hosted by @mummyfique x @motherswork. ðŸ’™
â €
More than anything, it warms my heart to see that YOU, yes you, the online mommy community providing support to one another and coming together to help the less fortunate & supporting local businesses.
â €
Happy Mother's Day. May we continue to be the pillar of support for our children and our fellow mommies.
â €
PS: I host a monthly #mombosses networking party. There's one happening this coming Tuesday. For deets, join us at MomBosses United Facebook Group.
