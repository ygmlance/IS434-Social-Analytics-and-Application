#circuitbreakersg Day 34. Happy Mother's Day to all mommies! üíê‚ù§Ô∏è

Today happens to be my birthday too. Due to #circuitbreaker measures, it's near impossible to buy a #birthdaycake. So I just baked a simple Orange Butter Cake with Dark Chocolate & Nutella Ganache.
‚Ä¢
Haven't baked for more than a year, so my rusty baking skills really shows. Cake is too dense and ganache too runny. Actually I've always been a hopeless baker, haha!

Really admire my talented IG baker friends who always seem to create amazing bakes effortlessly! Please check out their feeds and you'll know what I mean:
