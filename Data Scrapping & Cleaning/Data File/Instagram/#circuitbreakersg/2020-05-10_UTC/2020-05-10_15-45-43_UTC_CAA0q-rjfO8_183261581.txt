Happy Mothers Day to me
Happy Mothers Day to our helper, Ruby too
She is a single mum with a daughter in Uni. Contrary to popular belief, I have not been the Pao Ka Liao mum, probably only about 80%... i had been a career woman since the day i left uni 😃. The helpers we have since the arrival of our triplets contributed a huge part to taking care of our four children's daily meals and fetching them to n from school when necessary. Thank you esoecially to  @lasalalea @glendacagas, Aileen and Ruby! Happy Mothers Day to four of you too. 😘😍🥰
