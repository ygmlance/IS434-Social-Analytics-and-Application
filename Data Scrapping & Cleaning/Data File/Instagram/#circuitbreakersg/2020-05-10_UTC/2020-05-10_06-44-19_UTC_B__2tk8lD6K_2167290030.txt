DAY 34 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
Mango Coconut Delight

HAPPY MOTHERS DAY!!
My meetha post today is for two very sweet and special women @fashionista_apparels And @nalinidhir
Priya and Neelu. I am blessed to have them as my dear dear friends, and grateful to God for picking the best gems to be a part of my life. Two strong women, who have faced so many challenges in life, but did it with a smile, and without having their beautiful personalities altered. They are wonderful mothers, who have not let any adversity get in the way of being good mothers. Strong willed, extremely hard-working, full of life, immensely inspiring and positivity personified! They bring joy to my life every single day, even though they are miles away from me. That is the power of love and friendship, that is the impact love can have. 
Ladies, I love you both, and always always will!
Happy Mothers Day!! As for the meetha (dessert), its layers of mango and coconut set with whipped cream and gelatine, topped with fresh mango set in agar agar jelly. Some coconut almond granola in there too ðŸ˜Š
