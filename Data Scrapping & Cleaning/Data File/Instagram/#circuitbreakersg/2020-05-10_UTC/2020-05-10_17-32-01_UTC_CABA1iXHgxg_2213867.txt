Dance practice of #wannabeitzy for today! 
Grateful to have such a pretty and talented young dance teacher @dancersera_ @pinkuu_92.
만나서 반갑습니다. 고맙습니다, 댄스 선생님!
Thank you for the 9 months teaching!! 🤩💃🏻 Hope that we will be able to meet you up, if you haven't return back to Korea after this circuit breaker and also hope to be your student again in the near future! 🥰

Ps: Last video, is just a funny screw up which the steps are pretty confusing. Also didn't do the legs part well due to space constraint. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ🤭🤭
