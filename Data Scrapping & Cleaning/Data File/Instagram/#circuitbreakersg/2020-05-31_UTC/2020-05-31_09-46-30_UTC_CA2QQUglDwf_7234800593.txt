What keeps your kiddos occupied during the past 2 months? 
We joined an 8 session STEAM online class at @duriansquare . 
Fun games, challenges, experiments are well prepared and thought off for the students’ interactions in the class. 
And because it’s an online class, the materials used for the experiments are household items which even more stimulates their creativity. 
I’m proud to say that Thereese have mastered gravity ☺️, learned how ice cream can freeze in matter of 5 minutes, the reaction of milk with dish soap, and a lot more. You’ll be surprised how simple experiments fascinates young kids. 
Sharing with you an awesome deal you shouldn’t miss.

@duriansquare will be opening weekend STEAM online classes this June (timing of your choice) at the price $100 for 4 sessions and experiment kits are provided.
