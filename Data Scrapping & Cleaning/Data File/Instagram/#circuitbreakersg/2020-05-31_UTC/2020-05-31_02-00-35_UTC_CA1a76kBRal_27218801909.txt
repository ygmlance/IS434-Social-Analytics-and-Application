Circuit Breaker measures are set to be gradually eased in 3 phases from 2 June. 
In 2 days, we will finally be entering Phase 1: Safe Re-opening!

All of us have had our daily activities disrupted during these 2 months of circuit breaker and we want to hear from YOU! 
What did you miss the most during this time?
