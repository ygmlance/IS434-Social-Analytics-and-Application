Circuit breaker home photography: capturing the Milky Way from my HDB apartment balcony on the 2nd level. Didnâ€™t expect to capture the Milky Way in such a light polluted country like Singapore but it can really be done. Clear skies, multiple image stacking and some post production and it magically appears.

Shot with Sony a7rii @ 28mm f2.8
