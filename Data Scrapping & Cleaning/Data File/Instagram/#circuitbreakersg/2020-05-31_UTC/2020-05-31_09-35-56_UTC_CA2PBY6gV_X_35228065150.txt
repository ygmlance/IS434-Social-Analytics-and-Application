The Mambo Jambo set at #ZoukPhuturescapes left us wanting more. It was great to see quite a number of Mambo Jambo regulars in the Zoom, and more on the Facebook live stream. Didn't expect to get the spotlight a few times and a shoutout, but that was so much fun.

Big thanks to Zouk, DJ Jeremy Boon, and all the other guests for this unconventional partying experience.

Really hope that we'll all be able to meet once again on the podium at Zouk.
