French Cuisine for dinner today ‚ÄúFrench Onion Soup‚Äù planned to cook this since a few days ago but just got to find ‚ÄúSwiss Gruyere Cheese‚Äù yesterday. Have watched a few recipes from a few different chefs, picked here and there to get the most applicable one for me. And this another time I got chance to use ‚ÄúRoasting Pan Cast Iron‚Äù (‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÅ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏°‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏°‡∏µ ‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏á‡∏Å‡πá‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏™‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ô) üòù ‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏π‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏ú‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ô ‡∏Ñ‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÜ‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏£‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢ ‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ü‡∏¥‡∏£‡πå‡∏°‡∏î‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏°. Authentic or not it depends on finding the right ingredients, I managed to find almost everything except ‚ÄúDry Sherry‚Äù so I used Red Wine and Cognac instead. Most of the recipe using Beef stock but I changed to Chicken stock (instant one to save cooking time) #frenchcuisine #homemade #frenchonionsoup #homecooking #CookAtHome #EatAtHome #Sundaydinner #roastingpancastiron #dinnerathome #homecooking #CircuitbreakerSG #happymealhappyme #Mycookingdiary #Foodies #foodporn #cookingathome #punggol #singapore
