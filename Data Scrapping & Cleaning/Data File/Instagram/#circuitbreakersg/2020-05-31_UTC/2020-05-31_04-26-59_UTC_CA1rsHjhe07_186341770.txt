Our life is like riding a bicycle, every pedal will take you further. Once we got onto a bicycle we know our only option is to move on. 😍👍🏻
.
We know at certain time, we may stop and get off to admire how far we have ride! And we know if we stop and we didnt get off, we will fall off. ♥️👍🏻
.
There are times for us to ride on, there are times for us to get off. Circuitbreaker lockdown is the time for us to get off and slow down our pace. Next week we are entering phrase 1 reopening, let's all get ready on our bicycle and ride on for the rest of 2020! 🥰👍🏻
.
Enjoy your last circuit breaker's weekend! And all da best to the world! ♥️👍🏻
