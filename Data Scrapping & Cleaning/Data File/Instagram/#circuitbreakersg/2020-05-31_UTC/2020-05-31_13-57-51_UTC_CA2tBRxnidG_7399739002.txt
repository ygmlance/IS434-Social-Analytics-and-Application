Circuit Breaker Day 5️⃣5️⃣! Just a blink of eye, we have passed 55days of Circuit Breaker. One of the hottest item in the menu, our dear customer ordered 11 Mango Sticky Rice for her community. The savoury of the butterfly pea glutinous rice paired with the sweetness of the Thai mango 🥭...it’s such a perfect match 😋! 🙏🏻😊
