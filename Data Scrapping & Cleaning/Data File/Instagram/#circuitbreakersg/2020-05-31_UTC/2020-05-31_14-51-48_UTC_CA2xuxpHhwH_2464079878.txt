Playing dress-up was one of many fun activities I did with my kids during circuit breaker💃🏻💃🏻 Ellie’s can’t wait to reunite w her classmates and teachers this coming Tuesday after two months of semi lockdown😷 •

Anya still do HBL next week cos primary2 will reopen on June 8. It’s not a bad idea actually cos i can spend some time alone w her when the younger one goes to school. Hope you all have a lovely week ahead❤️
