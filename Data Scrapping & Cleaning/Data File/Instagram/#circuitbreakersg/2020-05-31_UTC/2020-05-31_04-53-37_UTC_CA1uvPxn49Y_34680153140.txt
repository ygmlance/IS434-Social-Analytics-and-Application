Today’s card tells us a fresh start is coming our way. As Circuit Breaker measures begin to ease up. There’s a sense we are starting anew, heading into the unknown. The 6 of swords shows a figure leaving their past behind and I believe it refers to the old ways we use to operate. The old notions of chasing, rushing, buying is no longer important. Everything the world tells us to worship is taken away - money, success, career, what we tell ourselves we have to have. We are heading to the other side of this and this is an opportunity for us to reset. The bright sun in the card in the distance tell us there’s hope and great things to come. Surrender to this and keep your eyes open for the lesson and remember your power is not in what you have but what’s within! #wiseinnercouncil #wisewords #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #wisewoman #soulfulsundays #innerpower #tarotreadersofinstagram
