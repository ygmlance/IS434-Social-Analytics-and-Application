Macarons reputably difficult to make & girl’s 1st attempt is successful!🤩 Being a newbie in baking, she gets a big 👍 from me for trying this super duper high failure and low tolerance to error French pastry!
.

Took a nap this afternoon and woke up to see her baking macaron shells in the oven so I didn’t capture the initial mixing process. The macaron shells turned out with “feet”, the all-important delicate frill along the base of each almond-meringue shell!👍👍👍.

Manage to take a video of her piping the cookies and cream buttercream onto the cookies and cream macaron shells. (swipe ☝️to watch)

Don’t you think she has done a good job? .

Swipe to the end If you are game to try her recipe and can understand it. 😄.
