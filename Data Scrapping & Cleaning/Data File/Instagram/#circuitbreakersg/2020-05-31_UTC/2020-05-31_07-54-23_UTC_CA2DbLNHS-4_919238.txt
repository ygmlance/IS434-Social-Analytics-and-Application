In this period of being stuck at home, I’m BELLY BLESSED! My neighbours organise groupbuys everyday and also dabao food back for us if they happen to be near famous hawker stalls/restaurants (sometimes in cartons). They’re my knights in shining armour bcos Grab decided to cancel food delivery subscriptions at a time like this!! 🙃

Anw thanks to them, hubs and I get to have LEGIT awesome food from all over sg without having to travel and queue (or pay delivery fees hehhe) &&& we even made it to the news lol!!? Link: https://youtu.be/ph2flpVhaSs
