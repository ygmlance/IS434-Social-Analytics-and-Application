If picking up a new skill is The thing to do during the CB period, Aiden has it down pat. In this short time, he has managed to learn all 3 songs for his Grade 1 drum exam and is even playing them from memory! Teacher Vics gives Aiden a lot of credit for his self-motivated practice, and it's also because Aiden has very supportive parents who allow and encourage him to grow, that Aiden is playing so well. ðŸ’ª
