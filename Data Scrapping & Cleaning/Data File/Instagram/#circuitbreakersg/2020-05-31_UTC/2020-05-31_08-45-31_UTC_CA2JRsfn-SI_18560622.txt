CB is almost over and that means schools are opening soon! For Kieran who is in N2, I still have to wait till 8 June, and finally 10 June for baby Chase (and that will only be his 5th day in IFC since he first entered  school in AprðŸ˜…). .

I bought masks from various sources to see which has the best fit for K (pic2) and he prefers those from local makers (which understandably cost more than the factory-made ones from China). Iâ€™ve been trying to get K used to wearing a mask and have even showed him pics of cartoon characters wearing masks (collaged in pic 3). .

I also found his school worksheets that weave in virus-related snippets useful to engage K a little bit more on COVID-19 and the importance of hygiene and mask-wearing as well as being appreciative of essential workers (pic 4-5). Hopefully these little efforts will help to transition him better into the new COVID normal! #covid19 #maskon #kidsmask #staysafe #circuitbreakersg
