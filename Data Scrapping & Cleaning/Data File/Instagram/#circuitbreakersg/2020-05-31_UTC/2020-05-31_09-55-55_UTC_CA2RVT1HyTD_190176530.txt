I’ve had quite a number of @woobbee but I’m not sure why I just wasn’t inspired to try the iconic Pi Pa Gao Milk Tea (Herbalmint Milk Tea) with Pearls until I got curious hearing diverse feedback from my neighbours. It’s actually not bad and works pretty well for me - now I feel like I can sing a round of KTV. I’d prefer the milk tea to be richer though. Till the next estate group buy (with the rebates we got!) #woobbee #woobbeesg #herbalmintmilktea #pipagao #pipagaomilktea #peipakoa #bubbletealover #foodporn #instafood #foodstagram #sgfoodblogger #foodiegram #foodphotography #singaporefood #circuitbreakersg  #foodgasm #sgfood #circuit #bobalife #creativefood #groupbuy #supportsmallbusiness #circuitbreakersg #fooddeliverysg #bubbletea #milkteawithpearl #枇杷膏 #枇杷膏奶茶 #ninjiom #ninjiompeipakoa #fatbearcationeats
