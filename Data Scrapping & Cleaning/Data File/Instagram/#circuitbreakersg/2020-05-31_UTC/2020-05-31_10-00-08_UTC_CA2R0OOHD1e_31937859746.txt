Tried another new homecooked dish this weekend and is vegetarian taiwanese braised @omnipork with rice ( 卤肉饭)!! We added @omnipork, braised mushroom, tau pok ,tau kwa, braised canned beans and topped with a boiled egg! Also cooked a simple chinese beansprouts dish with tau kwa! 
Modified this recipe into a vegetarian version without alliums and change shaoxing wine to mirin instead and still taste good!
