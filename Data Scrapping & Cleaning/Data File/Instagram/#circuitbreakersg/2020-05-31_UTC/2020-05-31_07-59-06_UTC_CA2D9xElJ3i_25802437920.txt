; {Circuit Breaker Day 55}

Inspired by @kami_re, I decided to try making shio pan. I used @oladybakes shio pan recipe because it uses a poolish starter. Pretty easy to follow, which is a relief cause this is prob my first Asian bread ever. Hopefully I can improve my rolling skills in future. Shall taste test it later.
