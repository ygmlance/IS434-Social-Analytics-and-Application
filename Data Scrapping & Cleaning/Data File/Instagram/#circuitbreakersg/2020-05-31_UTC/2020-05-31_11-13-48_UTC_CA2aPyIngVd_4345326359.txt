Goodbye May!
Love how my team ended May on a high, with a virtual department meet that's nothing short of fun and laughter! We called the session 'CBingo'! Yes it might sound corny to most but it's absolutely nothing short of fun, and more fun! 
This Circuit Breaker has proven to be a test to us (and of course many of you out there) as we figured our way amidst the unknowns. With much love and collective efforts, we've survived and achieved a number of milestones. 
I believe we could do better and go further in the coming months so long we bang our heads together and solider on. One heart one mission!
Bring it on June! We are ready for you!
