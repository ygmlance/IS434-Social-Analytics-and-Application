Today, weâ€™re brewing Sayaka-no-mukashi matcha from @ippodoteausa, a tea company from Kyoto, Japan dating back to 1717. We start by burning @kungyokudo incense to cleanse the room and mind. Things you need: Chasen (Whisk), Chawan (Bowl), Chashaku (Scoop) and a Strainer. Ceramics from my friends @pascalegirardin and @mudrockceramics. Music by Johann Sebastian Bach.
