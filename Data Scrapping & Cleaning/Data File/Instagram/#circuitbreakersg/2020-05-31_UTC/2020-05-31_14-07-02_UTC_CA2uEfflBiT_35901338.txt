Mae and I have been staying home for about 3 months already. Neither of us miss the outside world because thereâ€™s just so many fun things to do at home, and I can do my work from homeâ€”an introvertâ€™s paradise. This is only possible thanks to my love @amileekang for going out to run errands and get groceries. What do you do all day long with your little ones? Are they bored and looking forward to the end of #CircuitBreakerSG ? Oh and Iâ€™m going to leave my hair growing. Letâ€™s see how long it can get.ðŸ˜„
