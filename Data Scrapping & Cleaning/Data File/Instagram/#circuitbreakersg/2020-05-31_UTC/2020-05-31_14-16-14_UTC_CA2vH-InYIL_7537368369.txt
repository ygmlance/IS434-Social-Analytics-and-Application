I've been meal planning for what seems like centuries now and having to take everyone's diet and preferences makes this a really tough job. I am very grateful that everyone loved the roast chicken from the @summerhill.sg DIY pack - that chicken really is so juicy and tender. And I'll admit that half the reason why I got it was also so I could make some kick ass chicken stock with the bones. Cos, you know, meal planning.
