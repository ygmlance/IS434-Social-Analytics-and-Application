#circuitbreakersg day 55
Early evening stroll with furrykid.
Met up with Kiara, a beautiful St Bernard, Fourdee, a lab and little Tammy, a schnauzer, a newbie in the hood. First time meeting Tammy who according to her pawmum can walk for 15 km unleashed. She was strolling from Sennett Terrace to Siglap, unleashed with her pawmum following closely behind😍🥰💪
