The last day of May - is my mom’s birthday! Still in time to make this post before the day ends! ⁣
⁣
We have been crazy busy cooking and baking that we only managed to cut the cake, gift flowers and present and celebrate at 11 pm tonight! God knows how we ended up so freaking busy during circuit breaker! ⁣
⁣
We had a fabulous celebratory home cooked dinner with boo whipping up a abalone soup birthday mee sua and an auspicious ang zao chicken! ⁣
⁣
A big shout out to Julia Lee OkimochiBox for helping me prepare the flowers, cake and birds nest! Couldn’t do it without you! ⁣
⁣
Happy birthday Susan @susansuyoko and many happy returns! Wishing you great health, happiness, love and thank you for everything you have done for our family, especially the furkids! ⁣
⁣
Here’s to many many many more great years ahead! 🎂💐💝🎉⁣
