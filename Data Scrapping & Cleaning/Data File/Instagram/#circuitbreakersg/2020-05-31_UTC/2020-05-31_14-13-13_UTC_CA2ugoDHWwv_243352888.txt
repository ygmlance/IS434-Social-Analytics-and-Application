Scientific proof that Nespresso coffee is essential to start the day and make us more presentable! 😉
.
Haven’t seen my Nespresso Singapore Marketing Team since the circuit breaker and earlier, as we were split into teams since March 👯 Seeing their smiling faces on video makes me happy bubbly inside! 🥰
.
We decided to do this over a weekend for fun, to do something together from our own homes 📲
.
🤝Still gonna be a while till the whole team is united face-to-face, but meanwhile, we have our shared passion for Nespresso coffee and having fun 🤩
.
Ok, last few hours of Sunday to enjoy. I know what I’ll be doing first thing Monday morning! *refers to video
.
💖 Double tap if coffee is a must-have for you to start your day! 😋
