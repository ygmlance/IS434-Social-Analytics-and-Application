So as alluded to in the last post, dinner tonight was from @standingsushibar. We ordered their Sakura #sashimi set (21 pieces of premium sashimi, such as house-marinated white tuna, Otoro tuna belly, Salmon belly, Hamachi etc, for just $38) and Salmon Aburi Superstar (5 pieces of hand-pressed assorted salmon sashimi). It was great variety, very fresh and tasty, and definitely enough to fill our bellies, especially since we already had a big lunch! ðŸ˜‹

Currently too full to have our #LadyM dessert yet, but might change our minds later! (**update** see insta story for our dessert pic)
