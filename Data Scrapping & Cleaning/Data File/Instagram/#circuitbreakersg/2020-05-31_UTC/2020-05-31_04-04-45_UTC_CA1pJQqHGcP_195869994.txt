[20.20 May 31: Circuit Breaker Day 55] When two of our favorite food meets, otah + egg = Otah Egg Roll.

I used Muar Otah $3.90 per box (150g) from @frozendozen_ and it was good! It was unlike those sold on the shelves, instead this pack here contains meaty fish slices and the taste was good!

Simply cut the paste into 'strips', add the egg mixture like how we cook omelette, add in the otah, roll up and cut it up before serving.
