Taking a break from sweets😂gonna be doing some hawker posts, followed by savory recipes😉💕 sharing my dad-proclaimed: best #minjiangkueh in singapore🤩 located at #lorongahsoo market - a lesser known hawker centre but with one of the best #hawkerfood and #sgheartlands vibes😋 unlike other stalls, they make by per serving rather than a huge one portioned out. It is super cheap at $0.90 only!!!!!😍 crispy on the edges with warm soft insides and packed filling of coconut/peanut or cheese🤤 definitely the definition of perfect min Jiang Kueh - the perfect afternoon snack😋 it’s on the second floor: look out for 和合 stall name✨🥰 u will see the nearby queue for nasi lemak😂
