Remember to walk through doors like they were meant for you.

Tomorrow I start a new journey as an Endocrinology Trainee as well as a Medical Registrar. It's been a long journey getting to this point with a roller coaster of emotions. Some of you know how much I struggled with deciding on a specialty. But I'm so glad to say that in the end, I let my passions guide my choices.
.

Faced with a lot of doubts and tribulations, there were so many moments that I questioned why I was doing what I was doing. I'm so glad that I asked the difficult questions. It helped me to delineate again the purpose why I chose this line of work and to rediscover the joys in my day to day job. And I am ready to take on whatever challenges that might come. .
.
At this juncture, I wanted to take the time to thank some people who I am so grateful to for supporting me, challenging me, counselling me, making me smile, and being with me through this journey. Thank you so much, and I won't let you down. .
