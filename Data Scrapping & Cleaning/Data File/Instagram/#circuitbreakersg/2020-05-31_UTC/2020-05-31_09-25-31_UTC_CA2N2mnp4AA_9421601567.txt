❤️🧡💛 JUNE 💚💙💜 It's always a month filled with celebrations. Though it might be a little different this year due to the current pandamic, I'm counting my blessings to be surrounded by loved ones 😊 I'm really grateful I get to experience WFH with my hubby everyday the last 2 months & likely the whole of June. Am also looking forward to finally be able to visit our parents 👨🏻‍🦱👩🏻‍🦱 and grandparents👴🏻👵🏻 after 2 months of social distancing measures in Singapore. 🥰 In times like this, it made us realise we don't need a lot to be happy. Joy is found in the simple things with those you love 💖
