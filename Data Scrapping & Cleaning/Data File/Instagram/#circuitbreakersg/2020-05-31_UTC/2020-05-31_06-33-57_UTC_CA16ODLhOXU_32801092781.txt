Circuit breaker Day 55: Pizzas from @spizzasg 👍 Based on swiping order, ordered the:
- Isabella (Parma ham + rucola, my fav of the lot! Liked that they kept the toppings separate so we could put it into the pizza ourselves)
- Special pizza Bianca (lovey white pizza, reminded me of eating pasta when having this, in a good way) - Franca (bit flat, not many toppings too, the other 2 pizzas were way better)
- Calamari (avg)
Found the crust to be a tad dry.
