Last 2 day of circuit breaker, I am feeling quite emotional about it. This circuit breaker is a very special 2 months when I get to see and feel my boy everyday. This kind of memories are very precious and I am glad to have these moments to be in my life. Yes sometimes it is tiring and frustrating, there are times when I going around screaming like mad woman but still love how the bond we have strengthened over these 2 months. Like today, he kept snatching my @feng_cha_singapore tea and didnâ€™t want to give me, ended up he drank half of it. I am getting worry about how he is going to go back to school, hope he will adapt well and fast, it always ache me to see how he cry when I left him there. But I trust his teachers to always doting him and know what to do. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #21monthsold #lastday #preciousmoments #preciousmemories #bonding #bondingmoments #loveyoutothemoonandback #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #maysunzz
