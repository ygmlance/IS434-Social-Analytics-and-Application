When you wanted both savory n sweet treats n couldnt make up your mind. The best of both worlds without too much of a hassle in these: a  decadent dark chocolate banana bread with a smidgen of liquor & Savoury Parmesan cookies. Love the bittersweet smokey notes of liquor n chocolate that meld so well with the natural sweetness of bananas. And those cookies, I cannot stop.ðŸ˜‹ Best of all, these babies take 20 mins tops to put together including bake time. They are my go-to when I want something quick n a cheese fix. .

Caved in n ordered this refreshing & floral bouquet of Jothi jasmine gin from @elephantroomsg. How ive missed this! Armed with an excellent read (my third book in 2 weeks), my day is complete.
