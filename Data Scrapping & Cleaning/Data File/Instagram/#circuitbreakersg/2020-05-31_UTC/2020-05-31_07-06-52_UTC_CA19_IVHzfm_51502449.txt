Sticky Honey Glazed Pork Short Ribs with “Bak Kuh Teh” Brown Rice, and French Beans.

Pork short ribs simmered in a brine of garlic, salt, and black peppercorns for an hour last night. Broth ended up tasting like garlic “bak kuh teh” so I saved 3/4 of it to cook the brown rice into. For the homemade stick glaze, I mixed soya sauce, organic honey, a bit of chicken essence, paprika powder, and a dollop of Ikea’s Lingonberry jam for the sour sweetness; ended up a very nice sticky sweet bbq sauce that I cooked the short ribs in for thirty minutes under medium heat. My plate ended up with a good balance of sweet-sour-umami bomb from the short ribs, the garlicky savouriness from the brown rice, and the light crunch from the French beans. 👌🏻 #glazedribs #shortribs #porkshortribs #bakkuhteh #homecooked #homecookedmeal #fromscratch #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
