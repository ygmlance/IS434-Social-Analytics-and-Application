Rainy day calls for a hearty bowl of #homemade 𝐌𝐞𝐞 𝐇𝐨𝐨𝐧 𝐊𝐮𝐞𝐡. ⁣

Actually, it was my momma who requested it. Ever since I tried @aroundthediningtable’s Mee Hoon Kueh dough recipe from her Three Dishes One Soup cookbook last year, my momma has been requesting me to make MHK whenever her craving strikes. Today’s MHK is the best version yet - thin yet chewy. That’s cos I finally unboxed my pasta machine and used it to make the MHK dough. 🤣🤣🤣 ⁣
