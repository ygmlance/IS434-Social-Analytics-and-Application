Pesto Chicken and Broccoli Pasta!

I recently bought basil pesto from Melvados so I decided to make this. It was a dish of much agaration - didnt have light cream so substituted with Meiji milk+a dollop of butter, and also marinated my chicken in some sesame oil, salt and pepper before panfrying them. It was nice! Will make this again for sure.

Now that CB is coming to an end, I wonder if I will still find the time to cook when wfo is more frequent. Guess will have to make a conscious attempt to do so esp over weekends. Keep safe everyone!
