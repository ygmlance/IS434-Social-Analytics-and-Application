LEEK | Stir Fried Leek with Roast Pork & Tofu - Leeks are a common vegetable but during Chinese New Year, they are considered auspicious to eat as they carry a symbolic meaning. Chinese leek (大蒜) or ‘dasuan’ in Mandarin sounds like ‘counting’ and it symbolizes wealth (having lots of money to count). So it is a must-have food for many who celebrate the CNY.
