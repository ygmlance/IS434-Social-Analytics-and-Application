With #circuitbreakersg coming to an end, I decided to finally shave off my whiskers which I have kept since day 1. I did trim a lil bit 2 weeks back coz it was becoming a tad irritating when yer eating. Still, it couldn't/wouldn't grow very long, so to mark the impending end of this miserable CB, I got rid of it.

Keeping the goatee for a while though, till I can get back to work
