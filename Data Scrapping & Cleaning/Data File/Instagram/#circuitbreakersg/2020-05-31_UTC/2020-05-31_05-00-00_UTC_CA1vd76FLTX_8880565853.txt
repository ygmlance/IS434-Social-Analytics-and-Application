Another Sunday spent cooking away - 算盘子 (Abacus Seeds with Minced Meat). Followed the recipe by @themeatmensg loosely but it turned out so delicious yum :-) 💕 Truly a labour of love...If you ever make it yourself, you'll never want to try the commercial ones ever again. (Swipe all the way for a video of the cutie abacus seeds floating to the top which was so fascinating to watch?!?! 😛) #abacusseeds #circuitbreakersg
