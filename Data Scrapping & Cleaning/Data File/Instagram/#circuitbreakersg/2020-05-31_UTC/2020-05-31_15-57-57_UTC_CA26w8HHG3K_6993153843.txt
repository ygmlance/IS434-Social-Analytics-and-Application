Hands on activities subscdiption crates from @kiwico_inc .
.
I order 1 for Sarah and Luke each and both crates had activities that kept them occupied for a good afternoon! .
.
Luke's crate was to engineer an arcade claw to pick up prizes ajd Sarah's crate was to play and learn with ocean animals! What i love is the effort that goes behind these activities - they were far more superior that the other boxes i have suscribed before. Like for example, sarah's activity could be stored up in this folded bag which was the ocean mat! And comes with a hardback story book! Neat!
