Before all the teens post stuff on their stories and post that fucking useless “10 person challenge” shit, lets look into our own racism in Singapore. Some of you might argue: Oh look at us, multinational, multiracial society, accepting of everyone right? Of course, racism is not as prevalent here, but it’s still hidden beneath the surface. How many times have I went on the MRT and seen fat chinese aunties refusing to sit next to migrant workers? My own parents are fucking racist as shit. There has always been this prejudice against Malays as gangsters and Indians as construction workers. Of course, friendly banter and jokes between friends are fine but it’s the older population that still have this mindset that anyone not chinese in inferior. Of course, this does not encompass all of them but some bad apples that we need to root out. Let’s treat everyone in Singapore equally before looking in the US.
