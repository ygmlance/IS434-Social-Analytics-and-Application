#Circuitbreakersg day 54

It was labour intensive Saturday and my mind wandered off while doing menial damn hard work chores with incessant chatter in the background that I realize .. While humility is not thinking less of yourself, it can lead to people thinking very little of you. Or is it because one is surrounded by superficial people? How do we remedy this?

Anyhoosss, dinner last night was ordered in coz too tired : ðŸ”º Pan fried salmon with satay & fries.
Weird combo but pretty tasty. ~
