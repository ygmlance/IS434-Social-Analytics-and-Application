🥳 Decided to go for something different this weekend to celebrate the last sunday and 2nd last day of circuit breaker.😉 First time ordering from the Hawker United FB Page. 👏 Great Experience. 👍 With free Delivery for order of Min $30 for west area. Just $29.80, I have samble stingray, oyster egg and lettuce. Add on minced Garlic sliced pork. 🤤 And the food is nice.
