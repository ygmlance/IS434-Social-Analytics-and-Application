📌Finger Puppet Art Workshop✏ on Zoom💻 Thanks Susanne again🤗 We joined late at 11am but still managed to draw 2 puppets!🥰
📌Cooked Roti Prata and Curry🥘 for dinner. Something different from what the kids and hubby have been eating at home everyday during CB!😋
🛒Bought @dancingchef_sg Yellow Curry Paste which was flavourful but very mild (almost non-spicy) so it was suitable for the kids. Bennett rejects anything that is even a little spicy so I was very happy that he ate a lot of crispy Roti Prata dipped in curry last night😄
