🍫🍰Chocolate Basque Cheesecake. I’m obviously not over my #cheesecake cravings! In fact I wanted a chocolate version so badly that I decided to make my very own burnt cheesecake in 🍫🍫 (ok not very burnt on top because I was eyeing my cake like a hawk)⁣
⁣
It’s molten and creamy just the way I like. 👍🏻👍🏻Probably a little too eager to “test” my cake so I sliced it too early before it actually had time to set a little in the fridge. Which explains it being rather molten... I’m not complaining though because that part is pretty much the best!⁣

🥜Peanut Butter burnt cheesecake next??? Hahaa can anyone let me know if there’s something like that in the market already? ⁣
