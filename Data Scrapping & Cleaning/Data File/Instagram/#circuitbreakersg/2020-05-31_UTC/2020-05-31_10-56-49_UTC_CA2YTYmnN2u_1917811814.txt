It took me 5 years to complete more than 80km run in a month💪💪💪. The last 10km run was also a year ago in June 2019🏃‍♂️ What have I been doing? 😁

Must be CB now, then have more time to exercise.. Question is what happens after CB? Will I continue to be so active? But I will be happy to clock 50% the distance from now on 😛
