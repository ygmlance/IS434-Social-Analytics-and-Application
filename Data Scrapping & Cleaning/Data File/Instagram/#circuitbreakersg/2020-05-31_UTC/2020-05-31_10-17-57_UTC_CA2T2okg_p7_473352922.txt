Weekend doing more home cooking. First attempt for the Taiwanese braised pork belly rice (Lu Rou Fan 滷肉饭) and I really love it.
.
It's not that difficult. Just follow the below steps:
.
Wrap the below spices in the cheese cloth:
▪️3 star anise
▪️1 cinnamon stick
▪️6 cloves
▪️3 bay leaves
▪️2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
▪️2 pieces dried tangerine peel
▪️2 slices fresh ginger
.
1️⃣ Boil a medium pot of water, blanch 500g of chopped pork belly for 2 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2️⃣ Heat 2 teaspoons of oil at wok over low heat. Add 14 g of rock sugar. Cook the sugar until it starts to melt.
3️⃣ Add 1 finely sliced onions. Turn up the heat to medium high and stir-fry the onions for a minute.
4️⃣ Add shiitake mushroom (cut into small pieces), and stir-fry for 3 mins minutes.
5️⃣ Add the following:
▪️500g of chopped pork belly
▪️1/4 cup shaoxing wine
▪️4 tablespoons light soy sauce
▪️3 tablespoons dark soy sauce
▪️3 cups water
5️⃣ Stir and bring the mixture to a boil.
6️⃣ Add the spice packet into the wok
7️⃣ Add peeled hardboiled eggs
8️⃣ Turn the heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 2 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
9️⃣ Remove the spice packet and turn up the heat to medium high to thicken the sauce for 5min
