Day 55 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg - I saw (and bought) some #thaibasil (or #holybasil ) on a grocery run yesterday and immediately had a craving for my favourite #thaifood #comfortfood #krapowgai or #thaibasilchicken rice topped with a fried egg. I made it for today's #lunchforone ; normally would put most of the chilli aside as I have a rather weak tummy, but this was so #superyummy that I wolfed down everything whilst sweating and sniffing throughout, not a speck left on the plate! ðŸ¤£ The aroma of the Thai basil, garlic, onion and chilli was just heavenly, such a simple dish with such humble ingredients, but oh so comforting! #nofilter #easypeasy #homecooking #stayhomestaysafe
