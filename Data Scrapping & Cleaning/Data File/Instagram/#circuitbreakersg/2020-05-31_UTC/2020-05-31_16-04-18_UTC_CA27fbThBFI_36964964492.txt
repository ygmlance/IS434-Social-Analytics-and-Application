⁣In the coming weeks, we will post chapter summary and typical question analysis for different A’ level subjects as well as mentors’ personal sharing everyday. ⠀
🔹All the study tips are done by our mentors who have achieved excellent results in their A Level examination! ⠀
⠀
🔸Most importantly, we will also open up our DM for any student to ask any academic and school life-related question, can be a tutorial question you are struggling with, or any study/revision tips you wish to know.⠀
⠀
🔹Feel free to drop a DM on our instagram page at any time and our experienced mentors will respond to you promptly! (we will keep all your information confidential so don’t be shy to approach us!)⠀
⠀
🔸Stay tuned for our upcoming posts!
