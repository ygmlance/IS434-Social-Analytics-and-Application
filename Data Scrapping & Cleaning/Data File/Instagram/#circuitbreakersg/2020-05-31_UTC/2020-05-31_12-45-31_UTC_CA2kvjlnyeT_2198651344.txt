[#TheHedgehogAtHome] Didn't have to prepare lunch today, thanks to a @EggStopSG group-buy with neighbours. Expectedly, he chose the Beef Chilli Sandwich. There were lots of ingredients in my Smoked Chicken one! Tips: Good to toast/ reheat the sandwiches a little before eating.
.
The bonus were the @TruedanSG bubble tea and ice cream that came along (S$10.80 per set, based on 6-pax Party Set). No surprises for guessing the drink I choose - Matcha Green Tea with Brown Sugar Boba. The matcha flavour was quite intense and surprisingly not sweet. Sipping/ chewing on a chilled drink like this was just perfect for the warm afternoon. üåû Swipe ‚¨ÖÔ∏è for more pics.
