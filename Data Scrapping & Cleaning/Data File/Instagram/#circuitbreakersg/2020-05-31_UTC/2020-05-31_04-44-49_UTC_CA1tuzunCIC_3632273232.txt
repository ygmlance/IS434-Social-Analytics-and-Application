The previous round of Ondeh Ondeh, I wasnt too satisfied. And then much later I realised its because I used wrong flour! Instead of glutinous rice, I used FRIED glutinous rice flour! And its a hell of a difference! 🤣🤣🤣
.
And I admit I am a perfectionist, so I have been wanting to attempt Ondeh Ondeh again and I am so glad, its a success! 🍻
