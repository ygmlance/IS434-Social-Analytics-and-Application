Dim Sum lunch from Treasures Yi Dian XinğŸ¤¤ğŸ¤¤ğŸ¤¤. .
Iâ€™m a big fan of Imperial Treasure chain.  The food is always amazing and the menu in each restaurant features a wide range of dishes!
.
My top three choices are - Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck at Paragon, Imperial Treasure Fine Teochew Cuisine at Guoco Tower and Imperial Treasure Nan Bei Restaurant at Ngee Ann City
.
By the way, the mouthwatering dried scallop dumplings are now available for takeaway.
