ðŸ’–What is the best time of the day to exercise?ðŸ’– Actually it isnâ€™t in the morning... Research has shown that people tend to perform best later in the day. Strength and flexibility are greatest in the late afternoon. This has been attributed to the rise in body temperature slightly throughout the day and peaking in late afternoon. 
So it is good news for those who find it hard to wake up early in the morning to workout.
However, this does not mean that you get a less than optimal workout if you exercise in the morning. By doing so consistently, you can eliminate the morning performance gap. It has been reported that athletes who train in the morning improve their performance to levels seen in the afternoon. 
Personally, it has always been a habit for me to finish my workouts in the morning. It is a way of making you learn to be more disciplined as it minimises any time for procrastination. Like you wake up, eat breakfast, change and start working out. You are less likely to have scheduling conflicts and therefore more likely to exercise regularly. Also a morning routine leaves me feeling more energized and productive during the day. ðŸŒŸThat said, the best time to work out is whenever you can.ðŸŒŸ If you exercise at a different time of the day from your normal routine and feel that you arenâ€™t performing as well, it could be your body clock not being used to that hour of the day.
