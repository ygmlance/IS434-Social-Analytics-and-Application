MASTER the SPICE & OWN the WORLD insyaAllah..‚ù§ .
The much awaited Masala Chai and Ginger Chai. .
Thank you for all your patience Beloved customers and friends. Kak M has finally perfected her Masala recipe and the result... Masya Allah,  even Kak M herself got addicted! 
perfect balance of aromatic spices, just the right spicyness, the perfect texture and flavour. Justtttt the way how Kak M loves her Masala Chai to be. As usual, its UNIQUELY Kak M.
Guysss...nope you can't compare it elsewhere and can't get it anywhere else. .
Those who've tasted it, are now our repeat customers for Masala Chai. They said, its A little Arabic style, also a little Pakistani..wow...Alhamdulillah..
We leave it to YOU to describe it.‚ù§
.
If you're never a Masala Chai drinker, well give this one a try. But BEWARE.... you might just.....get hooked.üòâ

Yours Sincerely,
