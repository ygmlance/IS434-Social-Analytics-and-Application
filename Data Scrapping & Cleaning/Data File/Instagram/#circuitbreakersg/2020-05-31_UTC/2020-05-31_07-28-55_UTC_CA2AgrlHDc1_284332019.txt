What have you been doing during this Singapore covid-19 circuit breaker period?? One of the stuff I always want to do is a soil compost. I browse through some YouTube video and tried it out. I added in fruit peels and vegetable wastes, covered with dry leaves, buried it in the soil and left it for a month. All has been eaten by the earth worm and the earth worm has multiple so much. Itâ€™s amazing ðŸ˜‰ #soilcompost #stayathome #circuitbreakersg #gardening #earthworms
