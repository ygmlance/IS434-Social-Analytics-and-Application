Where do I even begin? 
Did I know that Leek Tarts existed before @patricoantonio made this? No. Did this tart taste like what I expected it to? No. Did I regret trying a slice (or four) of this tart? Again, hard no. 
Was it one of the best things I’ve ever eaten? Would I have this again? Is this post just full of rhetorical questions? Yes, yes, and yes. 
Thank you @basically for developing this recipe, for without you this tart would not have reached the depths of my belly. 
Made and shot by him, edited by me.
