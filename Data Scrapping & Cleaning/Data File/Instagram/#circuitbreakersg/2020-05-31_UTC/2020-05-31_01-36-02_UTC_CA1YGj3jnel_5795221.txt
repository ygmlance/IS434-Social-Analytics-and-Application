Celebrate small accomplishments!🎉 The Palloff Press is one of my PT exercises given by Dr. Ben @benjamintorresdpt as we work together on my lower back pain/issues through the exercises tailored by him for me to follow each week. This move took a while for me to get 😅 but once it clicked (Dr Ben said to picture that my body is an anchor ⚓ & I'm moving the resistance band at will..) I was ecstatic and could totally feel the difference. The week 1 video at the end I was like 🤷🏻 I guess that's how it goes ?? 😂 ... Haha so yay happy dance !💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻Ahhh, and it's only been a few weeks but I already feel a big difference (decrease in my back pain) I'm so glad I decided to take a step for myself to deal with what I thought I would just have to endure for the rest of my life 😅
