How to meet up with grandpa?
.
Since cb, the kids have not gone to gramps’ place but when grandpa goes on his walks, he rings the kids and they wave at the balcony
.
#theAteamSim laments that it has been a long time since they visited their gramps and they miss toys, books left there
.
A couple of days before 2 can visit so it won’t be long
