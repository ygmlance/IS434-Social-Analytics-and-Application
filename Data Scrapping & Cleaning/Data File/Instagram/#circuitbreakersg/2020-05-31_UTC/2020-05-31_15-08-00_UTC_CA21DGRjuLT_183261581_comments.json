Helper brought her out early with the pawmum supervising from upstairs\ud83d\ude02. Yesterday we passed by their house n Kiara was lying down unleashed while the humans were playing badminton. One of the human siblings spotted Bruno n called out to him, Kiara immediately got up n wanted to dash out \ud83e\udd23everyone yelled... \u201cshe is not on leash\u201d n literally pushed her back into the house.  This evening we met a huge 2 month old...old english sheepdog.  He was all over Bruno who dragged me away... scare\ud83d\ude02",
