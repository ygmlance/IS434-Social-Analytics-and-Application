<Numeracy Activity Preview>
.
Children are curious. They pick up numeracy concepts by comparing, investigating and talking about what they are doing.  Presenting numeracy in different forms can allow your child to experience counting in a variety of ways! So switch things up - count backwards, count in 2s, read books about numbers, sing '99 milk bottles on the wall’ and practice numeracy with these activity sheets!
