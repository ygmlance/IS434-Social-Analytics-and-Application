CB Day 55 of 56. Todayâ€™s homecooked meal is rosemary-themed. Took me a while to find fresh Rosemary herbs and the Purple Sweet Potatoes. So just grilled pork chop marinated with a mixture of BBQ sauce, brown sauce and rosemary. Then also oven-baked the marinated potatoes and sweet potatoes as the side dish.
