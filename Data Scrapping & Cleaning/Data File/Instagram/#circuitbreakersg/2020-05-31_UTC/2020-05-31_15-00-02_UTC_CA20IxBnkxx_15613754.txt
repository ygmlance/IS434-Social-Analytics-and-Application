Lychee Duck Curry with coconut rice. (MasterChef Australia s10 recipe by Singaporean Sashi Cheliah)  Was initially sceptical about this but the use of lychee turned out really well although there slight misstep. Amid the events that is happening around the world and in life, perhaps cooking is what kept me sane. #circuitbreakersg 36 #mylollybellykitchen #ibonappetit #quarantinecuisine #lockdowncooking #isocooking #isolationcooking #isolife #MasterChefAu
