Mr K and I couldn’t resist the syrupy sauce from the Taiwanese Three  Cup Chicken (三杯鸡) and we “were almost” fighting for the very last drop of it. 😂
.
Recipe:
- 2 pcs of bone-in chicken, cut in chunks
- 4 pcs of dried red chili, cut in 4 pcs each
- 8 cloves of garlic, cut in halves
- 5cm of old ginger, sliced thinly
- 5 sprigs of Thai basil
- Sauce: 3 tbsp of light soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp of dark soy sauce and 2.5 tsp of brown sugar
.
1. Add sesame oil to a hot pan.
2. Add in the chicken pieces, brown them and set aside.
3. Add more sesame oil, stir in the garlic, ginger and dried chili and fry till slightly brown and fragrant. 
4. Stir in the chicken and basil and cook completely.
5. Mix the sauce well before pouring it in.
6. Finally, add the Chinese wine and then the corn starch (mix 2 tsp of corn starch with 2 tsp of water).
7. Garnish with more basil if you have any extras. Ready to serve.
