Throwback to last August where we celebrated National Day 2019 together as an agency playing card games together - The Singaporean Dream. ⁣
⁣
Funny how now biggest Singaporean Dream is for Circuit Breaker to end without any extensions! 😭⁣ We miss the simple pleasures of having a meal together at coffee shop and physically attending work meetings... So let's all be law-abiding and responsible citizens even after Circuit Breaker ends ok? 👍🏻⁣ #wearepinnacle #thesingaporeandream #circuitbreaker
