“A Sunday well spent brings a week of content.” - Proverbs

This week also marks the end of the Circuit Breaker. Hope everyone is keeping well. Sunday is also a restful time for the soul. I'm thankful for the time to spend with the little ones at home, chasing them around. They just grow up too fast. Stay blessed and in health!
