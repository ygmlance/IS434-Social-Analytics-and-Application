Dinner from @honolulucafesg
Ordered their Set Meal which is quite reasonable priced (Main + Drink + Crispy Polo Bun):
1) Salted Egg Butter Chicken with Rice & Egg
2) Duo Sauce Spaghetti with Chicken & Egg 
Their packaging looks normal but the food were 👍. Not my lucky day - their egg tarts sold out 🙁! #honolulucafesg #hkcafesg
