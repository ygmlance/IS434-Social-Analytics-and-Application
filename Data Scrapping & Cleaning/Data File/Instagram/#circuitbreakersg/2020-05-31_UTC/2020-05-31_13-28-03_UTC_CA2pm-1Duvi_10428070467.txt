☆Wings of Hope - Peranakan Tile Art☆
Incredibly honoured to have staff from @nkfsg join me in my inaugural Peranakan Tile Art series this Sunday morning via Zoom!

I have been wanting to create Peranakan Tile Art using pastels and Wings of Hope is the first in this series. This design was created specially for the NKF Pastel Art Workshop and it symbolises hope amidst all the uncertainties we are facing right now. What is most meaningful is the collage of our individual tile art - it forms a uniform Peranakan Tile wall effect, representing all of us standing in unity despite the current situation. 
A big thank you to everyone for joining me this Sunday morning and I hope this pastel art session brought you as much joy as it did for me!

Till the next session, stay safe & stay creative!
