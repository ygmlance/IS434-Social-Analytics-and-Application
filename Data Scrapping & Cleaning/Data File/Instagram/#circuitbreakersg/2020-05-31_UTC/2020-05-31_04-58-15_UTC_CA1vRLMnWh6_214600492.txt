Throwback..
Thank you @michelle.lau82 yiyi and Jessie mama for sending me this double boiled Pork ribs with Cordyceps soup to feed my twinnies!

Super nourishing and yummy! 
Thanks for the love! Feeling so blessed to such lovely girlfriend who constantly send love to me during this circuit breaker period!
