#1 Hey everyone!!! 😊 I decided to start an Instagram account to document my embroidery pieces. This is the v first piece that I’m quite satisfied with after practising a few other times 😊. I’ll definitely be doing more embroidery and I am so excited to try out other styles. So stay tuned for more updates! ☺️❤️
