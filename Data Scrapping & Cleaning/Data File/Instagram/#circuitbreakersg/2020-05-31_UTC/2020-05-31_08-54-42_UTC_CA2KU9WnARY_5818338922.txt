Annnnnnd just like that 2 months of Circuit⚡️Breaker has gone by💨 💨
⠀
What a ride it has been and we want to once again thank YOU! for being home and with us through this period！🙏🏻
⠀
From sharing and gifting roast meat to your friends, family and grandparents to ordering a FEAST😋 for your boyfriends or girlfriends, we delivered without fail.👍🏻
⠀
We’ve seen orders from overseas like USA & Australia, people who can’t be home with their family but want to share the good food that they’ve heard from their friends through Stories posted by you! 🤩🤩
⠀
Come Phase 1 , it’s still business as usual for us and we hope to serve you again and see you sharing the good stuff with more people! ❤️❤️❤️
