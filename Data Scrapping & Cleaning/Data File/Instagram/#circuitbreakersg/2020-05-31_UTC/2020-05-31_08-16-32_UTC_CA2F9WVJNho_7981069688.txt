Miles Davis & John Coltrane - The Final Tour, 1960. Released on vinyl for the first time in 2018, recorded by Radio Denmark during the quintet’s final tour. Almost the same band that recorded Kind of Blue a year earlier. Coltrane gave notice that he was leaving once they got back. Hear “So what” played so differently and Coltrane showing what he is all about. Miles just gets on with it.  #milesdavis #johncoltrane #thefinaltour #jimmycobb #paulchambers #wyntonkelly #columbiarecords
