We are in the last weekend of #circuitbreakersg. Like that 8 weeks gone. Now it’s time to slowly go back to normal. Not the normal normal like we used to know it. It’s the new normal. Still need to be careful and only go out if we have to and always keep a safe distance n don’t forget our masks. Today I made lontong. This is one of my favourite dish to eat out at malay hawker. But it’s the raya break for them still so to satisfy my cravings I made it at home. Here’s my lontong.
