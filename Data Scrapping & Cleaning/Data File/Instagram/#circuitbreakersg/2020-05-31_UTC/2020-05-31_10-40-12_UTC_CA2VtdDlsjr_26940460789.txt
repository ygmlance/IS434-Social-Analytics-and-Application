How to be a successful freelancer.

I have known this gentleman personally for 19 years now since he was 14. How time flies! A highly intelligent, diligent yet very down-to-earth and sincere person. A wind band conductor, an educator, a musician, an orchestra manager, a businessman... and he enjoys it very much.

Well done, Yao Cong! Always proud of you! 🎵

Those interested, you can follow him on YouTube under the nick “Tubbyyao”
