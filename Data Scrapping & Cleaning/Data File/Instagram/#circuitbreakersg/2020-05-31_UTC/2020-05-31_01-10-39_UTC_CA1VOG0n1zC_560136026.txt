#sparrowgreen : #circuitbreakersg rekindled an old sports . Discarding the minimalistic runner for stacked height , and not turning back because of aging legs . The curious mind explores the carbon plates in the zoomfly 3, after appreciating the ZoomX foamâ€™s energy return. With the first 5km run , we found that the React foam firmer and less springy than the ZoomX foam. We also had to adopt a fore-foot strike to the carbon plates as they are located in front, the spring back does not seem to be reactive for mid foot strikes .
