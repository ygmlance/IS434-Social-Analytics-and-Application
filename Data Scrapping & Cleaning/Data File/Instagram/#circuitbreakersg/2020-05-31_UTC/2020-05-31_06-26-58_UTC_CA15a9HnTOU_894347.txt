Day 55: Throwback 2011.  This was my 1st Bali pre wedding shoot with my photographer husband. We stayed in a Villa in Ubud, and the place was so beautiful. To me this was not like a working trip, but a very memorable traveling trips with friends. We had meals together, and travelled together and chit chat a lot too. I think this should be the fun of having oversea prewedding. The experience for the pre wedding shoot should not only be in the pictures, but also in our memories. 🥰🥰🥰🥰 This is why I ❤️ my job so much 😍😍 #stayhomestaysafe #circuitbreakersg #fightcovid19together #bestoftheday  #sgmakeup #sgmakeupartist  #sgig #sgigbeauty #instamakeup  #love #instagood #onlinemakeupcourse #beautiful #instadaily  #like4like #thelittlebrushmakeup #jovietanmakeupartist #throwback #tbt
