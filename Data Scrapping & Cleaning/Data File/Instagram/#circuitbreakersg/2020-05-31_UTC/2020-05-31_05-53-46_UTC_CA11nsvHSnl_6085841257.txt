Today, we have some amazing news to share with you...⁣
⁣
Our clinics will be FULLY opened on 2nd June!🥳🎆⁣
⁣
That means, we can see more clients in a week and you can finally get an appointment with us if you couldn't during the lockdown period.⁣
⁣
Oh yes - Sports Massage is available too 😁(only on enquiry basis & done by a physiotherapist)!⁣
