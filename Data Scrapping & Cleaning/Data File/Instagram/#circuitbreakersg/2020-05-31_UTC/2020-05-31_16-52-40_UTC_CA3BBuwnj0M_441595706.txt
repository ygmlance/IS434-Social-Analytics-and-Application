As #circuitbreakersg draws to an end, the kids are finally returning to school, I must agree we get to spend this super quality time in confinement as a family. We made our own food, we eat every meal together, we built a table together, we made our own toys and crafts. When I told the boys they have to head back to school next week, they were frowning away and inside me, I’m celebrating already. I need space and proper quiet time. But I’m truly thankful for this blessed family time of 2 months. #lastdayofholiday
