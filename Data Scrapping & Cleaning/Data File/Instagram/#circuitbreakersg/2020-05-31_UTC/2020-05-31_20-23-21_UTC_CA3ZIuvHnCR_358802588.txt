The ultimate goal this #circuitbreakersg was the launch of my own personalised branding, which I'm pretty glad all the sleepless nights and hardwork paid off because I am truly satisfied with the results of my websites. Been working on this for months, and maybe almost to a year.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Biggest shoutout to @sherilynchua & @ruthhannahdc for contributing to my branding in very important manners! (More to be shared over the next few days üòä)
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
And right now I just want to thank my best & closest friends who have always been so supportive of me in many ways. Be it just opinions or advise, encouragements or contributions to this launch!
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Last but not least, my love for always being supportive & encouraging, taking the time to give me constructive opinions and advises whenever I really needed another person's opinion even when he's so busy ‚ù§ thank you for being there while I was in the whole process of this launch @big_niel ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Some of you may be wondering why I'm tagging you because we didn't discuss anything about this personally, but I've always been appreciative of how everyone's always so supportive & encouraging in the things I do the past few years and even now ‚ù§ ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
