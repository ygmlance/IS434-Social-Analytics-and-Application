I still have a box of the sliced up cheesecakes in the freezer. ðŸ˜‚ the husband likes the base, surprisingly. Unfortunately, not sure if I'm able to replicate it again.

Been sleeping in the day and staying awake at night these few days. My body clock is screwed. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Also, starting to get bored at home because I'm basically reluctant to do the necessary, aka  housework.
