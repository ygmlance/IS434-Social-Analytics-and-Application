Trying to be as environmentally conscious so out came my mother's old tingkat. 
At first I didn't believe what older folks said about tapaoing this way serves a different way to make the food more delicious. But somehow, it did... maybe it's a placebo effect or maybe it's just the fact that we are eating it out of a piece of history instead of clear plastic. 
This mee rubus by itself is already freaking amazing from this pop up store in Hougang, having it stored hot in the container and allowing it to continue stewing in its gravy just made everything even more tasty. It was a bonus when the macik said "adik, tingkat cantik ya"

Carrot cake was given enough space in the container to breathe and not be squashed together in a paper wrapper. The pieces of eggs, carrot cake and garlic were all separated... omg... so different from eating it from a tingkat.

Oyster cake was given the same treatment. Placed in the spacious tingkat to be allowed to breathe. No more squishy mushy shit that we get when we bring it back home. The bonus here is that this tingkat has a small compartment to store the umami chilli sauce that goes so damn farking well with the crunchy oyster cake. 
Result: now I understand why the older generation enjoyed food coming from tingkat. The small little things really make a difference in the presentation, texture and overall feel to the food. 
Thank you mommy for teaching me yet another lesson.
