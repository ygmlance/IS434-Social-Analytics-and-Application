Life should be lived In technicolour. Vivid bright sparks of infectious energy makes all the difference between a vibrant life and an indifferent existence. I’m constantly walking the balance between “only doing the things I love” and “let’s get real” because “somebody’s got to do it.” Perhaps it’s not a dichotomy between the “likes” and the “dislikes” - perhaps they are not mutally exclusive in the 1st place. Sometimes we do it because we love it, sometimes we do it because we love the ones we’re doing it for. And sometimes as we do it, we learn to love it eventually. Blessed Sunday to all. ❤️
