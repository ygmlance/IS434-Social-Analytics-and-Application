Day 55 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg - Made more #lemoncurd #mascarpone #tartlets for friends - had to use some smaller round shells as I ran out of the square ones. Received feedback that yesterday's batch was a tad too sweet so I ditched the caramelized walnuts and stuck with #raspberries & #blueberries & #mint with less of the curd, hopefully the natural tartness of the fruits would help balance the sweetness. Love taking #nofilter photos in #naturallight even on a cloudy day, shadows cast are lovely! Added a vid of my stirring the mascarpone into the curd because why not? 😁 #homebaking #stayhomestaysafe
