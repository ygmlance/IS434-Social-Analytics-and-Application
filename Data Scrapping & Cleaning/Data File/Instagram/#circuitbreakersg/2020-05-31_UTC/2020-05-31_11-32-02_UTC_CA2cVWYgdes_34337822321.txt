[Update] #Pilates4Fundüåà raised close to S$2,500 over the last 7 weeks for 7 beneficiaries during Singapore‚Äôs COVID-19 Circuit Breaker! This would not have been possible without the support of my friends and family, who showed up week after week in the virtual studio. This project is also a personal achievement, having dipped my toes into social entrepreneurship and starting something that I can truly call my own. I experienced the ‚Äúone-man show‚Äù challenge that many budding entrepreneurs  go through - juggling marketing, administration, customer service, IT, lesson planning and teaching on my own. On top of my day job! But by keeping it small-scale, the project is manageable. 
#Pilates4Fund will evolve as Singapore exits the Circuit Breaker on Jun 2. Join me for the launch of #Pilates4Fund 2.0 this Saturday, Jun 6, 10.30am! We will work our core for an arts cause - keeping @thenecessarystage afloat in these hard times! PM me to sign up!
