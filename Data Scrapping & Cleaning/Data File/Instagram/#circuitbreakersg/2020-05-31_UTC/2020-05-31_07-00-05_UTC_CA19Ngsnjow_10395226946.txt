Day 55/56 of #Circuitbreaker in SG. Roti prata (or roti canai) - Indian flatbread made by frying dough flavoured with ghee. Served with curry. One famous saying with this dish is "flip like prata" (capricious), stemming from the action of tossing and fliipping the dough during the cooking. Made an accidental stroke and now its jarring 😤

Its the second last day of our version of lockdown here but I think must of us are not going see or feel much differences once it's over, since the measures are to be eased slowly 😪
