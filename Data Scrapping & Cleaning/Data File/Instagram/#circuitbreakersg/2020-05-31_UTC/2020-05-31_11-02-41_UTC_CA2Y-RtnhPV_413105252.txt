Circuit Breaker Day 55 - Made a few Mediterranean-style Pork Belly Wraps on Self-Cook Sunday. It's an easy recipe that uses only a handful of ingredients that's easy to find in the supermarket. Was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to make the Greek yoghurt herb dressing and how delicious it was. So tangy and refreshing, it's simply perfect for the weather today! 👌🏻
