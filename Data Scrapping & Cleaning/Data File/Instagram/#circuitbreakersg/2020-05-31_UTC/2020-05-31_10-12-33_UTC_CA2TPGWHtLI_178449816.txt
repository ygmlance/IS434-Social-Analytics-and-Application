Day 55 of #CircuitBreakerSg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So what has been your food cravings these past few weeks? Even though sushi and sashimi has been one of my favourite foods, surprisingly I don’t crave it that much.

But one strange thing I crave is @shakeshacksg! It’s strange because burgers are not on my list of favourite foods but I really wanted to eat something cheesy and meaty. Got my fix last week and pleasantly surprised to find Koi downstairs too!

What about you?
