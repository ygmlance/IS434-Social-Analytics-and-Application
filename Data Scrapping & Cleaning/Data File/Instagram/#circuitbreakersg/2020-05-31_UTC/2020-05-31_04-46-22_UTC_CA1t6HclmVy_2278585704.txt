36hr to a new phases of #circuitbreakersg ... accompanied with a chill Heineken on my bed as I scroll through my album’s, imagining that I am going to travel again but I know #notanytimesoon 😥

Situation changes in an blink of an eye. Like the caption within 90min... this moment freezing wind was blowing and the ❄️ just starts to falls as the wind dies down. 
Perhaps it’s all about we gotta adapt and lives! 
I am not someone that likes look back in life’s but I’ll re-strategise and move on whenever things just don’t turn out to be the way it supposed to be. 
#mood #throwback #iambored #lifeisfullofsurprises 🤷‍♂️
