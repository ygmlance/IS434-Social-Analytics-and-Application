Sunday Brunch, was a Whitebait and Kale Fried Rice. Minced garlic and lard cubes were sweat in lard, and when fragrant, minced pork was added and cooked at medium to high heat until about cooked. Refrigerated leftover rice was thrown into the wok, and everything was mixed well. Beaten eggs were added to a depression made in the centre of the rice, and it was mixed in with the rice, at high heat. A seasoning of Superior Light Soya Sauce was added, as was fried whitebait and cubed fishcake, and mixed well. Chopped Kai Lan, or Chinese Kale was thrown in, mixed into the rice over high heat until cooked. The fire was turned off, chopped spring onions, a generous sprinkling of freshly ground Kampot red peppercorns and a swirl of sesame oil were added, and folded into the fried rice. Delicious when served hot, with a topping of fried shallots and fried whitebait. #whitebaitandkalefriedrice #friedrice #friedriceparadise #sundaybrunch #eatathome #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
