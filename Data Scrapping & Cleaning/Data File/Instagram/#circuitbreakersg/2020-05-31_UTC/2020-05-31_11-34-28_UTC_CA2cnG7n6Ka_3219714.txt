Spinach mushroom cheese pies.

Being in the kitchen, baking and cooking is pretty therapeutic for me. I find solace being engrossed in my own space of experiencing with new recipes. At times I failed, I learnt and I try again. I donâ€™t judge myself for failing. I just try again and again and again.

Time spent in the kitchen is teaching me patient too. ðŸ˜Š
