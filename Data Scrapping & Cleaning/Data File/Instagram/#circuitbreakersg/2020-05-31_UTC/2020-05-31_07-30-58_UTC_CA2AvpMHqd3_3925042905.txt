Happy Sunday! 
May is coming to an end and so is #circuitbreakersg.

I'm kinda used to life during this #stayhome period. But as June approaches, I'm so looking forward to seeing my parents and in-laws again, finally! 
Other than that, we would still continue to stay home.  So, please continue to stay home and only head out for essential duties.

Mummy @ninjapris shared Baby Ian can't wait to visit his gramps again!

What's the first thing you would want to do on 2nd June, after the #circuitbreakersg ends?
