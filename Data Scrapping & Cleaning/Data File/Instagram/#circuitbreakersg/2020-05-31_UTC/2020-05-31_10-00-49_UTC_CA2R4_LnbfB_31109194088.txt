Kudos, mommas! We've survived yet another week!

In a couple of days, the Circuit Breaker is going to end and we will be welcoming a 'new normal'. This new normal will probably keep us hanging by the thread for awhile, like how we finally gotten used to the CB after nearly 2 months, and pretty sure I'm not the only one feeling the anxiety. So, here's me sharing one of my favourite quotes that have brought me through life's ambiguities.

I absolutely love love love this one and I sure hope we can all embrace the change and the uncertainty, allow things to take its course, and trust that things can only get better.

Hang in there, mommas!

Ps/ Do share with me if you ladies know who actually wrote this quote. ðŸ¤“ -- Ashley
