Have been looking forward to this as their SportsHub concert in August becomes less and less of a possibility.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Such a swell of emotions watching this concert.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
High at the usual hits,⁣⁣⁣
Heartbreaking to see them performing to an empty stadium,⁣⁣⁣
Tickled at their usual hilarious banter after all these years,⁣⁣⁣
Amazed at the effort in the stage setup and pyrotechnics.⁣⁣⁣
(Seriously a light stick on every seat in the stadium? Crazy amazing set up.)⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
But this last scene,⁣⁣⁣
this long, long bow to an empty audience,⁣⁣⁣
was the tear jerker.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
An appreciation to their fans worldwide,⁣⁣⁣
A tribute to their craft,⁣⁣⁣
Or a mark of solidarity to the current state of the world?⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
So yea, thankful and glad to be ending CB with their performance.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
And thankful for the poignant reminder to remain hopeful in the days of the new normal:⁣⁣⁣
⁣
我和我最后的倔强⁣⁣⁣
握紧双手绝对不放⁣⁣⁣
下一站是不是天堂⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
就算失望⁣⁣
不能绝望⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
