[20.20 May 31: Circuit Breaker Day 55] Nowadays, I reduce the intake of carbs as it makes me bloat.

Since I am gradually clearing freezer space so that I can buy new stuff 😂 I used the remaining sliced Chinese mushrooms used for a steam dish earlier and half a box of Myulchi Bokkeum #멸치볶음, stir fried with cauliflower rice, garnished with chopped spring onions. No condiments needed, simple and tasty.
