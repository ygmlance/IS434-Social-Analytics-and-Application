🥟🥟🅖︎🅨︎🅞︎🅩︎🅐︎ with extra crispy edges aka 羽根つき餃子, just like how they make them in Japan🇯🇵. These are slightly time consuming if you factor in the marination period but the end result is quite worth it!

To make the filling, chop 3 green cabbage leaves🥬 and sprinkle 1 tsp salt. Leave for 15 minutes, then squeeze the water out. To the chopped cabbage, add minced pork, chopped spring onions, oyster sauce, sesame oil, soy sauce, white pepper, chopped garlic, minced ginger, sake, mirin and a dash of sugar. Marinate well using your hand. Leave in the fridge to marinate for at least 2 hours before you make your gyozas for best results.

Arrange the gyozas in a fan shape in a nonstick pan, and leave the bottoms to crisp up for around 4 minutes over low heat. Add flour and water(texture of milk) and quickly cover, allowing it to steam for another 3-4 minutes. When the crispy edges are ready, drizzle sesame oil around the edges. Invert over a plate and serve with vinegar, sesame oil and soy sauce.
