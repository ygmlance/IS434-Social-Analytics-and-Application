ACTIVITY 💡: Baker’s Girl

Little Miss 👧🏻S3 is quite obsessed over the nursery rhyme Pat A Cake, and how apt it is to end off May and our Occupations 职业 prompt for #funplaywithchinese with a mini #dramaticplay being a baker 烘培师! We read this lovely book 山羊蛋糕店 by 木村裕一, made mini pastries and sewed finger puppets over the past few days. She thoroughly enjoyed sewing all her finger puppets!

As May comes to an end, the #circuitbreakersg is ending as well, and Singapore enters Phase 1 of recovery. There are lots of upsetting news around the world lately, and yet there are also many more uplifting incidents all around. Let’s all remember to choose love no matter what. Introduce the diversity of life, of people, of cultures to our children. Show them what love is, and what love is not. 💕
