Day 55 of Circuit Breaker.⁣
⁣
My first attempt of baking Lapis Surabaya. After baking so many Rabbit Swiss Roll, 🐇 I am left with too many egg yolks. 🥚 In order not to waste them, I decided to make this Lapis Surabaya, because it needs 25 egg yolks just for a small 3.5” x 12”  size. ⁣

Went to borrow a 3 in 1 baking pan from @meow_7878 and have to consult master @dorisgoz when I did a wrong step!🤣 Eventually managed to salvage my precious butter. 🧈 ⁣

Sifu Doris, can pass bo? 🤣⁣
⁣
Conclusion? I think better just buy from our SG best Lapis Surabaya baker lah! @dorisgoz  I will only attempt this if I have too many egg yolks. 😬 ⁣
