Sunday Afternoon Tea, was a bowl of Chilled Black Glutinous Rice Pudding, which is a cold, congealed version of what is known as Bubor Pulot Hitam, or Black Glutinous Rice Porridge, which is eaten hot, and in a more liquid consistency. It is a very simple dessert to make, with only a handful of ingredients. The black glutinous rice is first soaked for several hours, and then it is boiled in water with Pandan Leaves to enhance its flavour. Sugar (white or palm, or a mix of both) is added to taste. It is served with a swirl of coconut cream which has a little bit of salt added, for contrast. The version i like best, is when it is chilled, and served with a splash of brandy added! Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #pulothitam #pulothitampudding #sweetandsalty #sweetandsaltydessert #sundayafternoontea #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedtea #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
