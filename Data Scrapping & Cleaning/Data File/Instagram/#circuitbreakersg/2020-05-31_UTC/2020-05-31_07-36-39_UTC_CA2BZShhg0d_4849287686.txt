Tofu New York-style Cheesecake | Had leftover silken tofu and some spreading cream cheese - decided to combine them together to make a classic baked cheesecake (loosely based on @kimjoyskitchen 's recipe). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the tofu did not impart any weird taste at all and in fact made the cake lighter and moister than a typical cheesecake. Paired it with a simple cranberry-lemon compote to add some tartness to balance the sweetness of the cake (because I accidentally over-measured the sugar). A great accompaniment to afternoon tea or coffee!
