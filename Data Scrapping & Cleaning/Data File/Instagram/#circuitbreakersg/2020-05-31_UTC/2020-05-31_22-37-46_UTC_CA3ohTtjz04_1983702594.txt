Concocted this recipe for an Asian take

Felt strange at the first bite because of “food association” but the subtle taste of the Soya Sauce, Honey, Lemon zest and Ginger wrapped it up beautifully ................ #sourdough #bread #sourdoughbread #teriyaki #homebaked #stayhome #staysafe #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
