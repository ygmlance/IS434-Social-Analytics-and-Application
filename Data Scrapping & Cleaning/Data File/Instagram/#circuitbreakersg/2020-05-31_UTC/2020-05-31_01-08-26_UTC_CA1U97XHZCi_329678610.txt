Decided to order a takeaway from @fishballstory for lunch the other day
.
.
Handmade fishballs were indeed different, one bite, it was springy yet not bouncy, you could taste the fish instead. I couldnâ€™t help but ordered a packet of handmade fishballs and fishcakes home too ($10 each)
.
.
Signature noodles $4.70, al dente noodles with housemade chilli that was packed with umami. Hey, that tau kee was my favourite. I should had asked for more
.
.
Whatsapp 9800 5036 for delivery or just pop in for takeaway. Brought my own containers too #savetheearth
