Throwback..
This circuit breaker period..I'm so blessed to have recieved so much love from friends around me.

Thank you @sataybeehoonheibeehiam  Desphine Yiyi for sending me a big box of coconuts and organic coconut water to feed my twinnies! 
Drinking coconut drink is considered to be the best source of nutrients and it hydrates and provides electrolytes during pregnancy.

Thank you for the love!
