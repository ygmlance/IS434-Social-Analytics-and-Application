Presenting dry wonton mee! Everything made from scratch except the noodles! Decided on this dish because I can involve Jade in wrapping the wontons! She totally enjoyed herself while wrapping up her 'beautiful' wontons!! And most importantly, she gobbled her food because she felt that she 'cooked' her lunch. 
As circuit breaker is ending soon, I do not know if I'll still have the 'mood' to cook dishes like this. Nonetheless, I'm glad to see my family enjoying yummy and healthy food!
