Day 53. Getting ready for phase 1 reopening. Woke up for the sunrise since life will be gradually back to normal with more precautionary measures. Lunch - wanton in chilli oil 红油抄手 and chilled mung bean jelly 凉粉。Both are appetising and satisfying in this hot weather. Dinner - Another round of sukiyaki, to celebrate the end of circuit breaker. Though there are still many cases per day, we are really blessed there are many recovered patients discharged everyday. Well done and thank you to all the frontliners. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #spendtimewithfamily #instadaily
