Morning!! 🌞 
My favourite breakfast hihi 🍳
We have butter, eggs, sardine fish can, garlic powder, sesame oil, black pepper, a bit of black soya sauce on top 😋

I prefer eat with Banh mi 🥖but its hard to buy in SG so we have bread 🍞 hehe just imagine the crunchy banh mi dip in the egg yolks 🙆🏼‍♀️ End of #circuitbreakersg and begin the “new normal” phase 1 today 💪🏼
Hope we can get through phase 2 and 3 real soon 💪🏼
