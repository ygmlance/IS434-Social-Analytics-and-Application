If you're reading this, you have survived 55 days of #covid19 #circuitbreakersg or partial lockdown in Singapore... ðŸ¥‚ the days ahead can only be brighter!

Got some fresh grey prawns from the market this morning and decided to make a #seafiod #paella as a small 'reward'. Quite happy with the flavours and the socarrat - the charred crust at the bottom of the pan. Nicely washed down with a slightly spicy NZ #savblanc . This period has brought a sense of balance and clarity into my life - I feel stronger and calmer (could it be all that yoga?), ready to take on what lies ahead. How are you feeling?
