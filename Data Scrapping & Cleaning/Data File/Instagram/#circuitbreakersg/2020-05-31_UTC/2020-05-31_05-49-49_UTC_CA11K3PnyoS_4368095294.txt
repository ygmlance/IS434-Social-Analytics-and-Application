Meaty Monster wanted to eat Cheese Burger!

So the Sister decided to make Cheese Burger for him!
.
Bought some Hokkaido Wagyu Burger 🥩from Don Donki yesterday. Added some cheddar🧀 & mandatory greens🥗. Didn't manage to get pickles, so use mesclun to replace. And what's cheeseburger without tomato sauce 🍅
