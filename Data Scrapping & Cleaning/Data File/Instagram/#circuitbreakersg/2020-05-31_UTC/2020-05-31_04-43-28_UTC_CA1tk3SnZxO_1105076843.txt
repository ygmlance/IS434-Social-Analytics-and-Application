This is my special 's' pendant design. It is inspired from our oriental vintage Chinese decorative doors, albeit a simpler take. This cutie pie has found its owner. Thank you for your support.

Tomorrow we are beginning to exit our circuit breaker slowly. As we slowly regain our lives, do enjoy the remaining time during this period. As strange as this sounds now, I am sure we will reminisce this moment months down the road where we can wear pyjamas at home the whole day on a work day. At least you brush your teeth right?

My sincere thanks to all for following us. 
I have lovely sincere creations here available for all. Any enquiries on our available creations, feel free to contact me. 
Thank you and have a good Sunday.
