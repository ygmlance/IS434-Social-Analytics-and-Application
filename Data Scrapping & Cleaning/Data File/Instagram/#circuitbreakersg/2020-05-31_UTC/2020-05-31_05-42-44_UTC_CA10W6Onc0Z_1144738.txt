The last Sunday of the circuit breaker demands prata! Especially when it’s a good one.
It’s my first time trying Srisun Express and I wish I had found them sooner - love the coin prata mutton set. The prata was nicely crisp and I really love the earthy and full-flavoured mutton curry.
The plaster was good too. And because it arrived warm, it tasted even better!
