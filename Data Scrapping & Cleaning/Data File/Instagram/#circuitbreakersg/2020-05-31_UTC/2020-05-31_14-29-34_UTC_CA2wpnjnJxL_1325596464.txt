Surviving #circuitbreakersg with kids.
How did we do it?
We simply saw and did things ... from the kids’ perspectives.
.
When we had #circuitbreaker thrust upon us, my wife and I , like everyone else were wondering how we were going to survive #wfh with 2 lively kids.
So after nearly 2 months we survived by seeing things from their perspective and in so doing helping them to see what is happening from ours too.
