31 May 2020: || Feelings || 😀🤪😫😭
Joseph has been displaying a wide range of emotions recently.. some play acting, but mostly for real. I’ve been thinking of ways to explain to him what feelings and emotions are.

So today we did this simple activity that I thought would help trigger some sort of conversations over how he’s been behaving. Even though the conversation didn’t go too far, the good thing was he had lots of fun! Gonna keep this somewhere.. it may come in handy in the future 😝
