This is kuih dadar: a soft, thin, crepe flavoured with fresh pandan juice and coconut milk, and stuffed with a gula melaka and grated coconut mixture. ⁣
⁣
It's nice to be home and have all the local ingredients so easily accessible. Making and squeezing out the fresh pandan juice for the batter was probably the highlight of the process - it smelled so. good!

Which kuih should I learn to make next? ⁣
⁣
(Not pictured: 3-4 failed crepes because this is harder than it looks!! The batter is a lot more watery than french crepes and the end result is super delicate)⁣⁣
