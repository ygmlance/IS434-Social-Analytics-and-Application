Grated potato with salmon

Ingredient: 3 pieces of salmon fillet from @9sseafood, broccoli cut into small pieces, potato x2, cow cheese, egg, milk, sautéed mushroom, mozzarella cheese

❶ marinate salmon with salt, pepper and herbs. Slice potato and soak in water for 5 minutes. Then put the slices into baking tray
❷ add 10 mL of milk to an egg and mix well. Add into baking tray
❸ start baking in oven for 20 minutes. I use toaster grill from @brunohotplatesg. I do stir from time to time to prevent uneven heating
❹ add a piece of cow cheese and salmon. Continue to bake for 5 minutes
❺ turn salmon the other side and add broccoli evenly on the tray. Continue to bake for 5-7 minutes
❻ add sautéed mushroom and mozzarella cheese. Bake for another 5 minutes and ready to serve
