♣︎ Breakfast idea ♣︎ Pork floss egg sandwich

Recently bought a big pack for pork floss from @beechenghiangsg and thinking of ways to consume it. One of a quick and simple ways will be like this:

❶ Simply fried an egg
❷ Toast bread if you like it hot. I usually do that
❸ Layer using lettuce, fried egg, mayonnaise and pork floss. Ready to serve!
