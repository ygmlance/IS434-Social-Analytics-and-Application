OK looks like a 2nd #cheatday this week ðŸ˜¬... Dad was going to drop off some @ladymsg #millecrepe and also offered to #tapao us lunch â€” how could I refuse? (we also didn't ask for Lady M actually lol, it was a surprise ðŸ˜‚). So we basically just stuffed ourselves with mutton #murtabak and egg #prata, plus lots of savory curry from (I think) Al Alfrose on River Valley Rd. Yum!

Planning for a light sushi/sashimi tonight, but together with the millicrepe, prob won't be as light as I imagine!
