【Recipe】Not sure is it just me but I’m  slowly getting used to this stay home as much as possible lifestyle😂. Mysteriously having withdrawal feelings these couple days and worrying about my kids going back to school #ohno #whylikethat 😖 
#circuitbreakersgending 
Anyway, all things come to an end, no matter how good or bad it is. Once we slowly ease back to our crazy hectic life again, we will eventually forget how it is like to be able to snuggle at home for ~2 months😪. #circuitbreakersg #stayhomestaysafe

Dinner tonight is Stir fried pork belly noodles with broccoli, served along pan fried tofu with snow pea minced meat sauce. 
Thai style flavoured noodles, spicy and addictive. Borrowing the wonderful porky flavours, lemongrass and fish sauce, this noodle stir fry is yet another quick and delicious meal that anyone will enjoy. 
Pan fried soft tofu, drenched with minced pork snow pea vegetables sauce. Pretty straight forward but the combination of tender greens, silken tofu and meaty gravy makes it really tasty. I would totally have this as a meal on its own! Make it vegetarian by replacing the minced pork with minced mushrooms. 
Catch me cooking this in my IGS. Sharing the recipe for the noodles. Tofu recipe another time. #honeybeecooksthaistyleporkbellynoodles
