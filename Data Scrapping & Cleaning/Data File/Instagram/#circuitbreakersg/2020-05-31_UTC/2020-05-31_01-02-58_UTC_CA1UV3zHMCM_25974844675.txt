Doing a little celebration as our SG circuit breaker lockdown is drawing to a close... only to realise Phase 1 post-circuit breaker feels like an extension of the lockdown ü§£‚Å£
‚Å£
On a positive note, most restaurants are doing discounted takeaways üòò  Make your calories count! No more mindless snacking for me - just quality food.‚Å£
‚Å£
Also I have been trying to eat one meal a day if I‚Äôm home all day without exercise. Trying my best to come out of this circuit breaker looking fine! ‚Å£
