Ahhh....Come 2nd June, my not-so-little humans will be going back to school already! 😩 How fast; time flew by just like that! I will be missing them, but I know they miss their frens and school even more haha, so they are looking fwd to going back to the daily routines of school life again. 😌

Truthfully, this Circuit Breaker is one of the best things that anyone cld ask for, you think so? At least, it is for me. Having my kids at home 24-7, watching them get into the routines of their HBL & enjoying those times we spent together as a family, is just too precious. My kiddos, they are in their teens already, but I still cherish each and every moment w them, and I cry every time they turn a year older! Cos, I’m quite emo like that.🤭 Of course there is the nagging and scolding every now and then, cos Ibu got to do what Ibu got to do, but having them around 24-7 the past 1.5 months or so has been a great blessing, more so that it coincided w the beautiful month of Ramadhan. 🌈MasyaAllah, for the gift! I just love it so much & I am so, so thankful. ❤️ .

So come Tues, 2nd June. Praying that all will go smoothly for my kids, and for you & your kids too! 💗🥳🌹
