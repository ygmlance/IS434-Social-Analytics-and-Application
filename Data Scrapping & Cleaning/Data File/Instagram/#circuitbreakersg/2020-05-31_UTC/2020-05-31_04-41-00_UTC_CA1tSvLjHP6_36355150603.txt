We’re coming out of circuit breaker soon! 🎉 But our lives will never be the same.

They say it takes about 21 days to form a habit. Some of us have become budding master chefs 👩‍🍳, some of us have been workout junkies 🏃‍♂️, some of us have adapted so well to WFH 💻(or some the opposite 🤯), and more!

One habit that is extra important ☝🏻 for us to inculcate will be the need to make sure we are in control...of our finances.

This period has taught us that it is important to relook our expenditure and save. 💰 Instead of splurging on expensive items, we have to be in super saver mode to 🦸‍♀️protect and maximise our money.

I’ve put together some simple tips on how you can save more money now, and even after circuit breaker!

If you feel they’re useful, please tag and share them with your friends! I’d love to know what you think as well. This is my very first content deck and I can’t wait to create more for you guys! 🥰
