Choose Kind Always
.
The other day, I went to get some groceries from the supermarket. The Q was really long, but when I’m 3rd in the Q with an elderly woman in front of me and another 40ish lady in front of her; I have to say that the elderly was standing way too close to the first person in line. So much so that the first person took glances of her and wasn’t looking too friendly. I was abit concerned at this point because the elderly looked quite frail and she doesn’t seem to take notice of the glances that’s seemingly hinting to keep her distance
.
But instead of giving her the glare and telling her to keep to the required social distancing rule, the lady helped the elderly to put up her cart for the cashier and she herself tries to move further down from the cashier to keep her 1 meter as much as she possibly could, as she packs her purchase and makes payment
.
Of course it is a necessity now to keep to the #socialdistancing rulings to #flattenthecurve but also don’t forget compassion, empathy, humility and patience, all the good virtues that makes us a better person
