Since I cannot visit the Haritts Donut store in person, decided I shall recreate the cafe experience at home. Their Limone donut was sooo good with a gooey lemon curd filling in the donut centre. Perfectly paired with a potent cup of Homeground coffee😍🍋🍩☕️ (Thank you @purpur_rain once again for the delicious gift and making this a wonderful Sunday!) #ckgoodeats #circuitbreakersg #harittssingapore #homegroundcoffee
