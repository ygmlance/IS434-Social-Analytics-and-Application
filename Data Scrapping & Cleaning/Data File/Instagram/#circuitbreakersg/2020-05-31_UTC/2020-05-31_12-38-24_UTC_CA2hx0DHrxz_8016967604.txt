A kids #rap video:
MASK IT UP! (ðŸ”Š) my 5yoâ€™s first rap attempt

Since @gurmitsingh.pck only produced a washing hands video, we decided to create one to remind everyone in Singapore to always put your mask on!

Two days to go till school reopens, remember to get spare masks (and face shields too!). Show this to your kids or share it with your friends.  Are you mask-ready?
