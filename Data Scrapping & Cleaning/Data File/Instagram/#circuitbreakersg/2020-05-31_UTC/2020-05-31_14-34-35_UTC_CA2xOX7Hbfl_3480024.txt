Cir Breaker Day 55 Dinner.

Takeout from Refuel 2 after we made a dropoff at my in laws' place. 
Miss-o salmon with mashed potato and mixed  vegetables is my fav dish from there. The baked salmon fillet is succulent and paired so well with the savoury miso broth on top of creamy mashed potatoes and nicely grilled vegetables.

I also ordered 2 sides since there is 20% discount if we spend over $30. The crispy cauliflowers with sriracha mayo and cheese was pretty good, not really crispy anymore by the time I got home, so best to order when dining in. I would also have preferred them chargrilled, but then that would not make them crispy. Haha. As for the maple garlic wings, I didn't like the sweetness so it's a no for me.
