Missy A told me she wants to dress up in this hanbok style dress with the two hairclips 🌸⁣

While her violin learning via Zoom has exceeded our expectations , I’m hoping for lesson to resume f2f. But I’m not sure when.. at least after end of Phase 1, Phase2a, Phase 2b of #circuitbreakersg 🤷‍♀️⁣

But nevertheless, it has been a complete opposite turnaround for someone who didnt want to play and start to love this #turkeyinthestraw tune. This is really unexpected for this circuit breaker ❤️⁣
