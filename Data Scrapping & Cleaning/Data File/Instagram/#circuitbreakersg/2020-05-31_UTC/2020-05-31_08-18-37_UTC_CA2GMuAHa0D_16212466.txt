Daughter made Kimbap lunch today before she gets busy with her school work from tomorrow onwards. Hey, it's pretty tasty considering that this is the first time she's making it! 👍🏻👍🏻😋 ⁣

Last week, I just made Kimchi Pork and before that, Korean Spicy Fried Chicken. We get all these Korean food cravings are after watching a few K-drama together during my daughter's mid-term school holiday. Family bonding through TV and food! 😍
