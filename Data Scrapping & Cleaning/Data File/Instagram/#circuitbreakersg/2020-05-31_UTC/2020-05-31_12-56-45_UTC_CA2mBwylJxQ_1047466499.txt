Having faith.

When we first got to know about CB, my parents were quite negative, and with the Gov sending us case updates daily, you can really feel like doomsday is here.

Suddenly all of our activities had to stop, no more hanging out with friends, no more dining outside, and even the pull up bar downstairs is cordoned off 😅

Circuit breaker and Covid 19 definitely impacted us. We’re forced to change many social norms and habits we had before.

Just 2 months ago many of us had no idea what zoom is. However 2 months later zoom had already became a daily necessity of our life.

In a recent comment by Warren Buffet during his recent AGM, he mention ‘Never bet against America, economy will overcome Covid’

His faith is not in the market, but in all of us that no matter what happen, we will always find ways to overcome it.

I keep faith that after this experience, we will all come out stronger, more grateful and more positive than before!

Looking forward to the rest of 2020, it can only get better from now on! 😊💪🏻 #circuitbreakerSG #sgunited🇸🇬
