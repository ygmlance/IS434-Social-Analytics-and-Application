Soon, it marks the end of Circuit Breaker in Singapore. #CB #CircuitBreakersg This is the view that I see every day from my room. Let's hope that life would be similar than before as we know it can never be the same again, but it gave us all a good time to reflect on our living. We should start our day with a smile and be more friendly from one stranger to another. Life goes on. Good morning ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ #stayhome #staysafe #onesg #sgteguhbersatu
