I needed to clear the cupboard and fridge so I pulled out the butter, flour and sugar and baked some melt-in-the-mouth sea salt butter cookies for family and friends... Pretty happy with the sea salt flavour but will try out some more flavours over the next few weeks if I can make time...
In two days time I head back to work at @osteopathichealthcare... As much as I'm excited and happy to be going back to work, I'm certainly going to miss the me and us time, the extra time to cook, bake, experiment and come up with new recipes... It's certainly been fun and I've had a ball sharing my foodie posts with everyone! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
