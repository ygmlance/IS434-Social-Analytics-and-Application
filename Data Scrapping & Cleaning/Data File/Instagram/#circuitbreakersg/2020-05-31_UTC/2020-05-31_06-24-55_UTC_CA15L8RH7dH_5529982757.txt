One of the most often uttered and heard phrase this #circuitbreakersg in my family is, “What’s for lunch/dinner? When is lunch/dinner coming?” I don’t think we have eaten at home as often before CB began. We have tried all kinds of cuisines, from hawker stalls to cafes to restaurants, developed a liking for some new foods, and decidedly banned certain foods from our dinner table, expanded our home-cooked repertoire of dishes, improved in our food IG reviews and learnt new photo-editing skills. It has been an exciting gastronomical journey for us and I can say for all 4 of us that we have appreciated every moment of it! As we ease into our nation’s reopening, I personally look forward to patronising these eating places once again, this time enjoying their dishes fresh and eaten on the spot, soaking up the atmosphere and being part of a culture that is uniquely Singaporean!
