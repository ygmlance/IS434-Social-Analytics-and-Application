~ Bossam ~ Korean Boiled Pork Wrap. Last post for #stayhomewithascott Let's wrap it up (pun intended) with Bossam! I started this ig account in april, in response to Capital Hope Foundation's pledge to help the less fortunate children when we post home cook/bake photos. It was under 2k posts then, but today it has over 21.8k posts. I hope our cooking/baking during this stay home period has allowed more children to be nourished. For the Simlets, I adapted the meal into a simple Bossam Bap instead.
