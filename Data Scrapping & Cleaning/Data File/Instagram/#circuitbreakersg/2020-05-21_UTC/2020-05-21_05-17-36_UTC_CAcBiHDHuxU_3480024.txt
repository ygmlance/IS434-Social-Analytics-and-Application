Cir Breaker Day 45 Lunch.

Zhajiang chicken rice. An accidental yummy find. 
I came across this new stall called He Jia Fu ÂêàÂÆ∂Á¶è at the KPT near my place recently, saw the banner promoting the interesting variety of food they are selling, and took a snapshot. Decided to order lunch delivery from them today, and what a great decision!

As you can see from the second photo, the food was so full that I had to transfer all to a large plate before I could tuck in. The zhajiang ÁÇ∏ÈÖ± was flavourful and meaty, slightly on the sweetish side, soy sauce chicken leg was huge, tender and well braised, and even the braised egg was good. It was a very filling and wholesome meal, and reasonably priced at $8.20üëç

I have yet to try the other dishes, and there are many like lor mee, prawn mee, zhajiang chee cheong fun and dim sum items. If you live around Bishan Street 22 to 25, they offer delivery at just $2. Otherwise, just pop by and dabao to go.
Latest update - they are now available on Grab Food too üòä
