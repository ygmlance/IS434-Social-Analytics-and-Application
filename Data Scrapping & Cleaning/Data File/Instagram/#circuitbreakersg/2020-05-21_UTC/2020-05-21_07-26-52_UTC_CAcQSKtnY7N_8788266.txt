Hi Guys! I've been alittle tied up with the day job so haven't been able to cook as much as I want but as promised I tackled my first #croatian recipe, Pita Zeljanica! I loved the light creamy savoury taste! Only thing I would like to do different is getting the pastry skin even thinner..
.
Ingredients:
Olive oil
500g of all purpose flour
300ml - 1 and 1/4 cups of warm water
1 teaspn salt
6 tbspns of milk

Filling:
2 handfuls of baby spinach leaves
300g of cottage cheese
2 tbspns of yoghurt or sour cream

1. Sift the flour first in a large bowl and gradually pour the warm water into the flour. Use a spoon and mix the flour together while pouring more water in until the flour all sticks together and forms a dough ball..
.
2. Knead the bowl into a ball of dough then flour your table or work station first before putting your dough on it to knead further for 5 to 8 mins. Put flour on dough until it's no longer sticky then transfer it to a plate brushed with olive oil & brush the surface of the dough with oil to not let the dough dry out and let it rest for 30 mins..
.
3. After 30 mins, generously flour your workstation and use a rolling pin to roll out your dough until its a very thin layer. If a table surface is not ideal, lay out a large cloth, flour the surface to roll dough on it..
.
4. On the side, chop up spinach leaves and mix the cottage cheese & sour cream together for the filling. Drizzle abit of warm olive oil on flour and spread out the filling on the dough sparsely then proceed to roll it and close any gaps. Cut off any extra pastry skin and avoid rolling too many times which makes the skin thick..
.
5. Preheat over to 200 degree Celsius. Brush baking tray with oil first. Lift one end of the pastry with filling and put it center of the tray then circle the pastry forming a spiralling out shape pie..
.
6. Brush some oil on the top of the crust and put it in the oven to bake for 30mins. 5 mins before the pie is ready to be taken out, brush the top of the crust with milk so that it doesn't dry up and the pie is ready to be served with sour cream or Tabasco sauce! .
