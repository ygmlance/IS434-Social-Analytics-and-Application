Day 45 circuit breaker/ Day 16 HQO thoughts:

To get what you love, you must first be patient with what you hate.
- Sufi saying

It resonates with me.
I believe some of us have to go through something that completely destroys us in order to figure out who we really are. And when we do, we bloom.

The scars of my past do not define me, but they have made me wise. My past failures were not meant to break me down, but to break me open. I am not my worst moments, my darkness or my fears. I am grateful for all my past selves for carrying me to this moment in my healing.

Those pains that you feel are messengers, listen to them. Heal, so you are able to tell the difference between the sound of your intuition guiding you or your trauma misleading you.

Whoopeedeedoo~~~ I am free! Last day of HQO 🎉🎉✨✨❤️❤️
I cherish the freedom of doing things I love, going places I like and meeting people who close to my heart... WHENEVER & WHEREVER. 
How about you, beautiful people?
No matter what
may you be safe
may you be happy
may you be blessed
