Sorry for the delay in listing more #fabricmasks for sale. We have been very swamped since last week sewing and packing orders leading up to the end of #circuitbreaker.  Some kids and adults masks have been listed since last night, with over 50% sold as of now. 😱😱😱 More bundles and masks will be listed by 9pm tonight. Do check out our #Etsystore in bio before they are all sold! .
