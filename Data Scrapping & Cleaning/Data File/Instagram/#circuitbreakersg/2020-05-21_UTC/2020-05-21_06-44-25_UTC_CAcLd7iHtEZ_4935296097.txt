Restructuring. Redefining. Reinventions.

This is basically how I like my art these days. I’ve always been a play person when it comes to my creative journey but I do have fear of how art is perceived to have to look perfect and realistic and while I feel I can try work on that, it doesn’t resonate with me so much. It’s like a struggle but digging deep, creative play is like a muscle I need to have scratched and letting go probably is my best trait now. I’ve probably been doing this mostly in most of my art especially ones who know me. I just never thought how much I needed this kind of play that much till recently how I felt crippled emotionally by an onset of sadness I had no idea where it came from. Something was not right yet I did not know where I could channel this unsettledness. I guess I know now. And I guess that’s where freeing the inhibitions is so important now. Do you feel like that sometimes? .
So here’s some play of my another free expression series which I once did in my 30days of play, I think longer. Pardon my messy table, my studio is my playroom truly. I like it when it’s full of stuff lying around. 
Imperfection here probably isn’t perfection I could say, but it is definitely healing for me☺️
