[HUH? NO WAY AM I SHOWING MY WEAKNESS! ]

That's my first reaction when I first came across this quote after googling about @brenebrown - an author and her TED talk is one of the top five most viewed TED Talks in the world.

Growing up in an Asian society, we were taught to be solution-oriented. If we didn't get 80 marks and above, we just got to do more 10 year series. During interviews, we shrink when struggling to answer "what's your strengths and weaknesses". During dating, we try to date the strong guys so they can protect us. 
Basically, no one likes to be weak so there is no such thing as being encouraged to be VULNERABLE.ðŸ˜… I relate to this quote more in #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #mco times. The only constant is change. And being vulnerable allows you to be more open to change. It also fosters more trust when someone opens up to you, isn't it?

No matter how much we want to change, we can't actually change until we put in the work. If we tend to bottle up problems or ignore them, then we can't actually change. the first step to change is to be vulnerable and open up. 
Start by being vulnerable and open up to yourself , and then your spouse and family and friends. 
Vulnerability helps us to make new friends, form new perspectives and lead us to new successes! ðŸ¤©
