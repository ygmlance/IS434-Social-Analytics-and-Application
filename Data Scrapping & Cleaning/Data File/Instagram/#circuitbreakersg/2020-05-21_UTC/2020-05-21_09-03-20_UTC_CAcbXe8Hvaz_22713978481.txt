What a difference 4 months made to our lives... Now and then... Can still see the bright smiles on our faces when we did not know what was going to hit us hard way back in January. Now happy or sian, we can only show through our eyes (in photos) when out in public. #NotASovereign

After 3 weeks of not stepping outside of home, brought Elfie for her much-needed haircut today. Really miss babywearing Elfie, and the idyllic days where masks do not rule life and death.
