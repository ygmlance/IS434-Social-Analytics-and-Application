Trying out scrambled eggs again by reducing the amount of milk this time.  More firm which we actually prefer. 
Finishing up the remaining smoked salmon, paired with toast...and breakfast is served!

Scrambled eggs done by Thermomix. It is good to have another “pairs of hands” to help out in the kitchen.
