Throwback to our last team photo together in January. Missing everyone and can’t quite believe we won’t get to see each other for another month! 😞
.
So…we were all keeping our (un-manicured) fingers and toes crossed, hoping the Circuit Breaker would not be extended. Unfortunately, with the recent government announcement made, we’re deeply disappointed that we would not be able to welcome you all back into our salons on 2nd June.
.
Having said that, the beauty & wellness industry has banded together and we are in the midst of collectively appealing with the authorities to allow us to re-open, with ample social distancing measures, of course!🤞🏼
.
So for now, we will be maintaining all appointments as they are. Please sit tight and be patient with us, and we will provide you with an update as soon as we can!✌🏼
.
Our circuit breaker promos for gift cards and advanced bookings are still available (link in bio).😉
.
In the meantime, stay healthy and safe, and stop picking those nails! We’ll be back before you know it!🤗
