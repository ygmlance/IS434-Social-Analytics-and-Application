For monthss, my fiancé has been persuading me to switch away from mainstream body wash & shampoo (that contain many harsh chemicals) to natural products. But I haven't done so as I'm too lazy to research abt it 😣. Now, FINALLY, I have gotten my hands on a set of #Kundal products - mainly the natural shampoo, protein hair treatment, ultra hair serum and body wash!

KUNDAL products use mostly naturally derived ingredients and are all silicone & paraben free. Furthermore, their ingredients are EWG Green Grade Certified, meaning there's no harmful irritants and allergents - great if you have sensitive skin like me!

Having used it for more than a week now, I noticed that my skin and hair feel much more hydrated 😍. All I know is that I’m gonna leave my house after #circuitbreaker with more confidence 😎 And I’ll be sure to continue using KUNDAL products even after this review because I truly love them!

Btw, all their products are available in 4 KUNDAL's signature scents - Baby Powder, Cherry Blossom, White Musk & Ylang Ylang! I’m loving the smell of my hair these days 😍
