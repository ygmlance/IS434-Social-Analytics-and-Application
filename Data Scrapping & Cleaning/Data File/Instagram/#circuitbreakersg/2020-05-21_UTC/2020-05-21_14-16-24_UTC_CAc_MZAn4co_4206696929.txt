Another amazing #wellington from @vianneymassotsg @lbarker_, this time with #ibericopork instead of beef. Succulent and tasty, with 
#whiteasparagus, pilaf rice, jus (which I lick off the plate) and french bread. And finished off with one of the best chocolate tarts I have ever enjoyed. And yes, the wine: #carruadesdelafite2003, a mature and mellow baby #lafite, elegant and smooth as silk. #sgeats #michelinstar #circuitbreakersg #pauillac #carruadesdelafite #bordeauxwine #frenchwine
