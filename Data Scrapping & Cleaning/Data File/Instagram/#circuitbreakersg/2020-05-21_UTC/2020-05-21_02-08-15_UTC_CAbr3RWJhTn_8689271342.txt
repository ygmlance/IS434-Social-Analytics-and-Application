MILK recommendation! During the start of the #circuitbreakersg I noticed a new brand of fresh milk that started to pop up in my local fairprice supermarket. Granted they've been selling their coffee, chocolate and yogurt blends for a while now, but have been wanting to try their good ol' plain fresh milk ever since hearing about them from sil so many years back. 
@farmfreshmilkmalaysia definitely tastes a lot better - creamier and fresher - than the Australian stuff. Probably partly psychological, but it also has a lower carbon footprint too since their farm is located in Pahang (think Genting/Cameron highlands for those unfamiliar with the geography). Anyway do give them a try!

Update: they have several farms now; started in Johor, expanding to Pahang and one also in Melbourne.
