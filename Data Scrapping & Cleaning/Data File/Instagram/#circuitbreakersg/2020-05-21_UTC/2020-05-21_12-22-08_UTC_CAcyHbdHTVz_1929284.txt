CB Day 45 of 56 ( and I don’t think I can resume work in office on weekdays on a daily basis even after CB ends .... only for certain days due to the safety precautions measures imposed by MOM). Anyway today’s homecooked meal looks like some Kids Meal. I need to make potato and egg salad so used one of the cooked potatoes, combined with some broccoli, carrots, penne with the white sauce.
