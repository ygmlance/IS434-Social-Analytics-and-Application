We didn’t order pineapple tarts this year. Somehow it didn’t feel right because this Ramadan & Hari Raya are like no other we’ve known.
.
So when the mood hit, we decided to make something.
.
Long Bean 2 said she wanted to try making pineapple tarts. 😬 I was determined to 1) not panic 2) make use of whatever we had in the house.
.
So it became pineapple jam thumbprint cookies. Easy. Phew.
.
Then I dreamt of this cheese cookie I had for Raya since I was a kid.
.
Had enough cheese & butter in the fridge. Found a recipe that took it to the next level - cheese thyme cookies by @theflavorbender 😋
.
I guess it’s beginning to feel like Raya.
.
❤️,
Raya Grinch
