With another month of being locked down, we need to keep creating ways to stay fit, healthy and alert. For us, we love competition. So we make up some workouts, like this one (The Heart Starter) and race each other to see who finishes first! So how quickly did you do it! Tag us in your workout and let us know the time! #hometeam
