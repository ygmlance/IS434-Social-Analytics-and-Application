This week, we did a lot of free play and unplanned observations.
.
🌿 I particularly enjoy it when my children are interested in random things at home. I leave this @kikkerland magnifier from @littleyellowbricksg in their treasure basket so they are free to access it whenever they want to.

Here is a shot of our plant study - learning that leaves come in various forms and textures, and veins play a vital role in keeping plants alive.

🌿 Nature play is sensory fun. And when naturally led by your child’s curiosity, you’ll see authentic learning unfold.
