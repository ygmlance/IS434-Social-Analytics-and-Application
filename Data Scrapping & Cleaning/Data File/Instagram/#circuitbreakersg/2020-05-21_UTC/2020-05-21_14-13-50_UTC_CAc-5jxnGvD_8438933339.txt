I really love this speech by Steve Jobs. 
The very story about connecting the dots itself, brings insights and hope too. Ever feel like something that you've learnt may not possibly serve to be of any use in future? 
Trust things will all work out.

Afterall, it's not easy to see all the connecting dots forward. However, it will be so much easier to see the connecting dots backwards. 
You have to trust and believe the dots will connect down the road. 
Have Faith. Have Trust. Believe in Yourself.

I'll leave you to watch (or re-watch) the rest of the story and let your insights grow on you. #StaySafeEveryone
