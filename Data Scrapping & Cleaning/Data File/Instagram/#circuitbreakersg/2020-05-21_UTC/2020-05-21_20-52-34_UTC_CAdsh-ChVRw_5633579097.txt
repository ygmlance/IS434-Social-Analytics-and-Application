Porcelain Tea bowl, Tang Dynasty

The bowl of tea has seen many faces, but has never seen its own appearance. 
One day, someone brought him to the beach, and he asked the Sea, “Have you ever seen your own face?” The Sea said, “Never. I have seen laughters and tears. But the worst is, I’ve seen death and there is nothing I can do. In fact, I make it worse, with my uncontrollable waves. And then I will cry and no one knows! I realise I just have to accept myself... and there is always calm after a storm.” #illustration #illustrator #illustrationartists #illustrationoftheday #illustratorsoninstagram #illustratorsofinstagram #quickpainting #inkonpaper #watercolour #watercolor #tealoversofinstagram #tealover #tea #teadays #internationalday #teabowl #bowl #songdynasty #chawan #circuitbreakersg #calmafterthestorm #myshortstory #notsleepy #stayathome #singapore #茶 #茶碗 #新加坡
