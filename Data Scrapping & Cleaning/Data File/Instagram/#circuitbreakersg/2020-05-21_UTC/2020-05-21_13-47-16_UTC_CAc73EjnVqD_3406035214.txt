One pot rice cooker chicken rice 🐔🍚 I’ve always wanted to attempt this and now I finally have the chance. I skipped the traditional method because it seemed too time consuming. Turns out that this rice cooker version was fuss free with all the flavours in one pot. I topped up with homemade chilli and ginger oil, and also a plate of 油菜 😋 because this recipe is so straightforward, I will definitely cook it again 😄
