#circuitbreakersg Day 45 Fasting Day 28:

My wallet has been with me for the longest time. Not sure if you can see the petina but this didn’t age well.
I’ve been searching for the simplest wallet for a while now but have been mostly disappointed with my search results. Closest that won me over was the Bellroy Apex Slim Sleeve... but because FML, it’s out of stock. How do wallets go out of stock? 
What do u guys use for EDC? Come tell me.
