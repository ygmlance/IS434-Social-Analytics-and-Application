With the enforcement of the Circuit Breaker in Singapore, the F&B scene is being put to the test.

Abhishek Cherian George @abhishekcheriangeorge, the founder of outlets like @spiffydapper, @dappercoffee and @oriental.elixir, started a campaign to provide survival funds for small F&B establishments in Singapore, like us.

We are reaching out to anyone who wishes to help out the F&B industry, by buying gift cards for F&B outlets that are supported under the campaign. Donating will give you F&B credits (in the form of gift cards) worth more than your donations itself. It's win-win! These gift cards will be valid for use after the CB ends.
