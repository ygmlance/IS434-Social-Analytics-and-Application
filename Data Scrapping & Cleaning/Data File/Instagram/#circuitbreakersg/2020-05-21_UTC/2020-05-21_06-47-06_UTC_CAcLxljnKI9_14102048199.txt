My kids used to engross themselves in doodling and marking out special occasions on our wall calendar. So two years ago, I bought these blank Monthly Planners from @tokyuhands.sg hoping to get them into the journaling habit.

As you can see, things didn’t go exactly as planned… and they never did understand the “life lessons” I’d jotted down on every spread 😅

Still, I’m keeping these partially ripped-up planners as a memento of their childhood, knowing they’ll make a great birthday present when my sons turn 15 *Hiak hiak*
