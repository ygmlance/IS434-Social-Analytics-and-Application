Traditional old school treats from @bengawansolocake! 🍰
✨
Egg tart (S$1.40) - The tart shell wasn’t the firm kind but it still maintained some crisp texture to it. I like that it didn’t feel very greasy. As for the filling, it was eggy and a little sweet, but still acceptable. Wish the filling was more though! 🥧
✨
Kueh dadar (S$1.50) - The crepe layers were really soft and the coconut filling was moist. However, it tasted a little salty on the whole and I felt the filling could be more fragrant! 🥥
✨
Binka ubi (S$1.20) - My first time trying this and it was pretty good. The coconut aroma was distinct and the texture was soft and chewy. It was not too sweet as well! 🍠
✨
Coffee roll (S$1.40) - The cake was fluffy and the coffee flavour was quite strong with slight bitter notes to it! ☕️
