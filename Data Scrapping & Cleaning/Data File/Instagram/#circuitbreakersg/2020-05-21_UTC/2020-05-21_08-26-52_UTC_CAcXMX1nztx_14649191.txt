Rice cooker chicken rice but I was swayed by my mum and added in way more water than the recipe indicated so we ended up with soft gluey rice which we turned into chicken porridge the next day. .

Otherwise, this recipe is absolutely amazing and fool-proof. Just throw everything into the rice cooker and cook. Donâ€™t be thrown off by your instincts that the water level is too low. The chicken oil/juices will flow down and it will be just right. .
