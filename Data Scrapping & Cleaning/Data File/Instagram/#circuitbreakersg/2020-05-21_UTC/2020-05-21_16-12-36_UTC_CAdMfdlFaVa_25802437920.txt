; {Circuit Breaker Day 45/46}

Soooo basically circuit breaker isn’t ending lah, but we are “phrasing” out bit by bit. Feels like UNO +4 wild card. Sigh.

Work has been incredibly busy for me this week, until I told my parents I need a day off. But then my friend reminded me next Monday is Hari Raya. Shiok. Finally can rest. Not too mention having 3 days of poor sleep this week.

Baked black brownies again, but this time, reduced the baking by 5 mins. So much more fudgy, tastier, and intensely chocolatey.

I’m just grateful I had a bit of energy to bake tonight. Been very exhausted the entire week.

Now how do I store an entire 9x13inch tray of brownies?! #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #baking #bakersofinstagram #bakersofsgp #brownies #blackcocoa #dutchprocessedcocoa
