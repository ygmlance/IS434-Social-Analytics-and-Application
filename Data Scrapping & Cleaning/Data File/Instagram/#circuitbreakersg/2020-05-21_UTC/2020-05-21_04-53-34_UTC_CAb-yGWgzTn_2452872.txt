- the texts are objects. I want them to affect readers- but in any number of possible ways. There is no one right way to experience what I have written. ..........................................................................
- I am not saying something. I am allowing something to have a voice, an independent existence. .................................................................
- I donâ€™t really think - just have sensations, or broken fragments of ideas, when I am alone without a means to write, or not writing or not talking. .........................................................................
- I write and talk in order to find out what I think. - .................................................................................
