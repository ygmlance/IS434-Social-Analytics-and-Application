Day 45 of #circuitbreakersg I made pan seared barramundi for dinner! My first purchase from @kuhlbarra and I’m happy with it! The fillets were individually packed in the ice box. The boys enjoyed the meal and gave a thumbs up! @drizzzyzac made the mash potato while I made the stir fry broccoli with mushroom and barramundi. Can’t wait to cook the barramundi belly soon! #circuitbreakerday45 #cookathome #stayhomestaysafe #barramundi #kulhbarra #fishnight #mistycovewines #mistycovesauvignonblanc
