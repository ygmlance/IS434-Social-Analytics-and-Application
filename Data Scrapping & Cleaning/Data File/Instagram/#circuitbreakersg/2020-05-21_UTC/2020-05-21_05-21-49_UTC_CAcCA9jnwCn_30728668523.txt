I have been reading Mitch Albom’s books “for one more day” and “tuesdays with Morrie” during this circuit breaker. I finished “tuesdays with Morrie” and it was emotional and interesting how a man can be so humble facing death. ⠀

I am left with “for one more day” and I am very interested to reach the end and see the finale and conclusion of things... ⠀

How have you spent your circuit breaker? ⠀
