The limited-edition, elusive McGriddles is one of the most beloved McDonaldâ€™s items on the menu. Since theyâ€™re gone for the time being, you can just make your own version of the maple-infused burger with our Breakfast McGriddles recipe!

Ingredients
1 batch pancake batter
3 tbsp maple syrup
6 bacon strips
2 eggs
Salt
Black pepper
Cheese slices

Steps:
1. Prepare pancake mix according to the instructions, or use your favourite pancake recipe.
2. Lightly grease a frying pan with butter and bring up to medium heat. Pour about a Â¼ cup of pancake batter onto the pan or into pancake rings.
3. Pour one tablespoon of maple syrup into the centre of the pancake and top it with two more tablespoons of pancake batter.
4. Once the edges start bubbling slightly and the pancake is cooked on the bottom, flip the pancake over and let it brown on the other side. Remove pancakes from the pan. 
5. Bring a frying pan to medium heat and cook your bacon slices on it. Cut them into smaller pieces if they are too big.
6. Remove your bacon slices once they are cooked, and crack two eggs into the same frying pan.
7. Scramble the eggs and season it with a bit of salt and pepper as you go.
8. Brush some maple syrup on one side of your pancakes.
9. Assemble your McGriddles with cheese slices, scrambled eggs, and bacon slices.
