ＣＯＶＩＤ１９

day 60 of WFH. definitely a day to remember. nobody would have thought that the way of life now is the new normal 60 days ago. neither did we expected the universe to make us learn to appreciate basic things the hard way. what’s 当たり前 (i don’t know the english equivalent for this lol) for you may not be so for some people. not forgetting to #dogood during this trying period while living right in the middle of a scene from a future documentary.

beneficiaries excited for the hot meal that just got delivered
