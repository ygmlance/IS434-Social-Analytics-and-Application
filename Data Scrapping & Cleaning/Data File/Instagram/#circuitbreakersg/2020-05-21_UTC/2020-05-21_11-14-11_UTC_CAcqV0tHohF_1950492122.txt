Been wanting to share this after many of you asked which #workout I’ve been doing in my last fitness post. 🏋🏻‍♀️ I am sharing 3 of my favorite @popsugarfitness videos. Do swipe ➡️ to see!

I usually do this 90mins before dinner which is around 6-6.30pm. Gives myself about 30 mins rest and then shower.

And no, I don’t do it everyday. 😆 If you ask my family, they will tell you that I am the laziest person in the family (other than the fat mini-me). I never like exercising. I am one of those who always try to “siam” PE lessons. Tried 🏃🏻‍♀️ and 🧘🏻‍♀️many years ago and stopped after a while. 🤦🏻‍♀️
.
I believe in doing only when I feel like it. 😅 And even with this, I am seeing good result! So can you imagine what it will be if you do this everyday? Go try it and let me know how you feel. You can thank me later. 😊
