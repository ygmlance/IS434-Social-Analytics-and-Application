Day 45 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (21 May 2020) - #nofilter #simpledinner Too lazy to make anything but I needed to use the #babykailan that was turning yellow in the fridge, so I stir fried with some garlic, oyster sauce and sesame oil; ate with parts of a store-bought honey roast chicken from Cold Storage; which cost only $4.90 and there's a lot left for at least another meal. #stayhomestaysafe #homecooking
