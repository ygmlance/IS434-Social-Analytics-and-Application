@soiaroy is a hidden gem Thai restaurant known for their rich collagen soups and delicious affordable Thai food.

Their signature Collagen Soup goes through a 12-hour long simmering boil to coax all the natural flavours out of the meat and bones.

The result is a rich, creamy and nutritious broth without any MSG.

I was impressed to learn that they are the number one Singapore Thai Food restaurant on TripAdvisor.
