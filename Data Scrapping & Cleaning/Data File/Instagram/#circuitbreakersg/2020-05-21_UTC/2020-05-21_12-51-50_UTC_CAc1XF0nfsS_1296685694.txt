Did you catch me on TV this morning where I shared about the differences of flour and baking tips on @ch8sg variety show【健康那些事- Get Fit With Me】together with hosts @dasmondkoh , @kym_ng and @iamfeliciachin ?
.

This meaningful program is specially tailored during COVID-19 to educate and entertain audience especially elderly when everyone has to stay home.
.
In this show, you can see some of my pastries which I’ve baked using Blue Jacket flour. I would like to thank @innobakesg for sponsoring the flour for the filming too.
