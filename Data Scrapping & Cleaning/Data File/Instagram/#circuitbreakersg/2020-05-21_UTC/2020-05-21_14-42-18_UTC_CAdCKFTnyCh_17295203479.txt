Itâ€™s been a week since Iâ€™ve posted about skipping and Iâ€™ve kept tabs on a few things. I must say that it really surprises me how quickly things change!

On a day to day basis, Iâ€™ve been increasing skips by 20. For the first 3-4 days, Iâ€™d stop by this additional 20 because itâ€™s getting rather uncomfortable and I donâ€™t feel particularly motivated. BUT Iâ€™ve noticed that I only start getting twinges or short of breath longer and longer into the session. Like itâ€™s exponential!

Previously Iâ€™ve tried running but the drawback is that I always have to run back from where Iâ€™ve gone. So it is difficult to motivate myself to run further unless Iâ€™m running on a track. (And I used to run mid to long distance in school. ðŸ¤£) Now with the skipping, I always have the option to stop. And that means itâ€™s actually easier to push just a little more.  So today Iâ€™ve added another 40 skips and didnâ€™t feel it at all. Iâ€™m pretty chuffed!
