I’ve never made a chocolate cake, and certainly didn’t think my first attempt would be to bake one using mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is actually an emulsion of egg yolk, oil and a little vinegar. 
The mayonnaise chocolate cake originated during the Great Depression when people didn’t have much access to eggs and oil.

I found myself in a “similar “ situation as more folks stay and cook at home during this Circuit Breaker period, baking ingredients like eggs have been flying off the shelves. And so when I came across this recipe from our local newspaper, I told myself, “why not?” Voila, the result was  a simple, moist cake that contained no hint of mayonnaise and tasted great - especially with a dollop of ice-cream! 🍦 .
