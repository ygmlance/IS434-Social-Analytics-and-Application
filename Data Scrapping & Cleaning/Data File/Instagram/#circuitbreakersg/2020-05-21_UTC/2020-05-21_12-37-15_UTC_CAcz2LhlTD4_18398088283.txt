👩‍🍳MUNCH AT HOME👩‍🍳
Scones are our favourite part of the high tea experience and we tried to recreate this at home☕️🏠 by baking some scones! Fragrant and buttery 🧈 raisin scones went super well with the fruity blueberry jam😍. It was a pity we didn’t have clotted cream at home but pairing it with jam and fruits🍓 was equally scrumptious🤤!
