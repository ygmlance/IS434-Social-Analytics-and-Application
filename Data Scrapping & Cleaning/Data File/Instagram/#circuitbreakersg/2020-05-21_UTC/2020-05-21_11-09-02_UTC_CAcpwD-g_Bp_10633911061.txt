Good Monday Morning!
It's another work from home week for many and this can be challenging for many reasons. One of the reasons can include the physical stresses of working from a makeshift non-ergonomic workstation.
Taking regular micro-breaks throughout the work day is very important to give the body's muscles a break. Getting out of your chair and stretching may help relieve muscular tightness in the neck & shoulders.
Osteopathic Health Care's David Farrelly @paddlingosteo.singapore demonstrates a simple neck stretch that may assist to alleviate muscular aches and pains.
Neck/Shoulder Stretches
‚Ä¢ Place one hand behind your back
‚Ä¢ Keep your body upright, look straight ahead and relax both shoulders
‚Ä¢ Gently and slowly tilt your head away from the side where your hand behind your back and bring your opposite ear towards the shoulder
‚Ä¢ Relax your shoulders as you hold the stretch
‚Ä¢ Hold the stretch for 15 seconds
‚Ä¢ Repeat 4 times on each side
