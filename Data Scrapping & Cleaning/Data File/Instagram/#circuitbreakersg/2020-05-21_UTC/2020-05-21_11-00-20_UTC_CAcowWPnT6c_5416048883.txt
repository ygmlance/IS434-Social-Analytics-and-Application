#1: Craft - Something you either love or avoid. One of the reasons why craft or artsy thing is avoided is due to the fact that you just don't know how to start. So here's 5 quick steps to kick start your art and designing journey! Really simple and we hope you would give it a shot! ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
#2: The wave of having to workout or exercise because "everyone else is doing it" seems to be a trend that birthed out of #circuitbreakersg BUT we want you to know that just simply heading out for a walk is exercising! We will be walking a slightly longer distance to send some care packs to an organizations serving the less privileged. So follow our page to receive updates that are upcoming soon! (Hint: Video, features and more!)

#3: Want something comforting? Wei Ern's pictured bowl uses duck, so feel free to use your preferred toppings(: Store-bought chicken stock works well because its already seasoned. For our Muslim friends, we know its not the same, but this could be a bubur lambuk substitute (Ramadan porridge). Selamat Hari Raya Adilfitri!
