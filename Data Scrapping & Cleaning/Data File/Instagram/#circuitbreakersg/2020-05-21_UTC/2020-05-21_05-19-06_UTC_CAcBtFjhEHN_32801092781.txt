Circuit breaker Day 45: Thunder tea rice / leicha 👍👍 Feeling so green & healthy after eating this. Think leicha preference is quite personal, I prefer the one at Tanjong Pagar while my mother prefers the one at Boon Lay. This one was from Ubi and cost just $3.50! Soup/paste was lovely, like that they added big pieces of leek. Not a fan of the garlic & perhaps it was missing the dried shrimp. But still a very good healthy lunch! 😋
