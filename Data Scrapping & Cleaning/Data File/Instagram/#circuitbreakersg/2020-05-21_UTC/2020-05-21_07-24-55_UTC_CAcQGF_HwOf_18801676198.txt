Today, my mummy and I did a science experiment ~ an air powered Shinkansen! It moved so fast, just like the bullet train in Japan!

It was so much fun! 😍😍 #igsg #sgmummies #sgkid #sgparent #sgparenting #invitationtoplay #invitationtocreate #circuitbreakersg #scienceforkids #stem #sciencefun #stayhomesg #stayhomeday
