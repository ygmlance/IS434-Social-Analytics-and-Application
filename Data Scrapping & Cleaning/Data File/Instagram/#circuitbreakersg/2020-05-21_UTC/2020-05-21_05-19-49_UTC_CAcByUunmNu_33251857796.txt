FREE bubble tea in your kitchen right now! That's right - those were the only 3 things I needed to make that cup of bubble tea, all from my kitchen drawer I was clearing out! I was shocked to see the LiHO DIY Bubble tea packs selling like hotcakes at $48/$85, for tea leaves, sugar, creamer & plastic cups!? The golden pearls really do have a huge loyal following 😳 Especially the effort I saw the fans took to cook the pearls & strain the tea leaves😥👏

Smartypence no-fuss, low-cost, high-flavour Red Bubble Tea recipe 💡
[Serving for 1 cup as shown, no pearls!]
.
1️⃣ Steep 2 Oolong Tea bags in hot boiling water just enough to cover it & extract all the flavour from the tea bag. I continued to let the tea bag steep (while covering the cup to keep it hot) for another 15 mins to extract the maximum flavour. 
2️⃣ Dissolve 2 milk creamer & 1 brown sugar sachet (or to taste). Note that it should be a hot super concentrated mix of tea, creamer & sugar, because you will add alot of ice later. Liken this process to how the Uncle makes your teh bing in the coffeeshop. 
3️⃣ Once everything has dissolved, throw tea bag away (no mess, no straining of tea leaves needed 😁) & add tons of ice. Finished! I was shocked that it was THAT simple, and Oolong tea bags make RED iced milk tea. Im guessing the Jasmine tea bags make the Green milk tea & will try soon. 😊 
Bubble tea aficionados, try this & let me know how it goes!
