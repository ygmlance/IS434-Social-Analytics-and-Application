"The rain dashed in even to where she was, dampening her skirt. The doorway area was quite noisy. A man ran up shielding his head under a small valise. A woman dressed in Western clothing hurried in with a scarf covering her hair. It was almost as if they had come to be with Etsuko, who was the only one not soaked."

I'm in the middle of 3 or 4 books, but I really couldn't resist cracking open Mishima's THIRST FOR LOVE when it arrived!! I was so struck by this passage and the innocuous addition to Etsuko's observations at the end‚Äîa little gash from which her longing for attention, her thirst for love, leaks. (Am I projecting???? Maybe.)
