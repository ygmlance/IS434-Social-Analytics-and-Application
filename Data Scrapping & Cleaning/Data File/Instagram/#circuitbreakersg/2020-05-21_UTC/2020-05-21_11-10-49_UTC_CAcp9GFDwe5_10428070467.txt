☆FCA Partner School☆
Heart In Hand Atelier is proud to announce we are officially the first Flower of Crystal Art (FCA) Partner School in Singapore!

I'm extremely grateful to my family, friends, students and Ishimaru sensei's encouragement to pursue a partner school certification. With the stringent criteria of artworks revision and accumulation of teaching experiences to different students, I have gained so much during this long process of preparation.

In my revision, I have added an extra challenge of creating a FCA X Peranakan Tile Art Style to almost every motif that I practiced and hope to marry the beautiful styles of both arts in this unique collabration. I'll post this series up in entirety in a separate post.

As a partner school, it is my responsibility to convey and break down all techniques, concepts, tips and tricks to equip you with the necessary FCA Teacher skills. These are excellent in honing your existing pastel skills and sharpen your observation abilities. Should you wish to spread the seeds of FCA, the Teacher's Course would lay a great foundation.

FCA Teacher Course would be available at Heart In Hand Atelier from June. If you are interested to know more about the FCA Curriculum, DM me for a non-obligatory chat today.

Look forward to blooming FCA enthusiasts in Singapore!
