CB DAY 46 -

3rd day in a row we didn't do any special activities aside from revising on colors, shapes, numbers, spelling his name, talking to him in complete sentences, playing blocks, reading books, watching TV and singing.

We tried durian. 😜 Surprisingly he didn't reject.

I'm a bit under the weather due to the lack of sleep and of course heatiness from all the eating. 😐 Let's try to do something fun tomorrow for the kid. Painting? 😂
