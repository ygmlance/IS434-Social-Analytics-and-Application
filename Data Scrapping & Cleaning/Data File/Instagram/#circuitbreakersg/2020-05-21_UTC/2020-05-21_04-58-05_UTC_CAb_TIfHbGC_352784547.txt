Got my ice cream fix from recently opened @monarchsandmilkweedgelato 🍦! Been wanting to give it a try since their opening start of the year✨ apparently on par with BOP😉 got their regular flavor and top favorite burnt white chocolate ($16) and their premium #dairyfree soursop mint ($20)✨ I super love their soursop! Especially refreshing during this hot weather 😍 the burnt white chocolate is a perfect match with my bakes hehe☺️✨ the upgrade I need🤩 glad that they are back on business😊 they offer delivery as well by @lalamovesg 👍

From the latest news, fnb establishments are still unable to open after 1st June for dine-in😔as much as it’s understandable for the long term health and safety of everyone, it’s definitely tough and difficult times for all😢 as much as I’m trying to control my expenses by baking and cooking at home. I’m also staggering meals and snacks to support fnb outlets☺️💕 I attempt to spread out my deliveries/takeouts between what I like and what I know (those that doesn’t have much publicity) hope this small platform of mine will offer some help and offer some smiles to u all one way or another💕
