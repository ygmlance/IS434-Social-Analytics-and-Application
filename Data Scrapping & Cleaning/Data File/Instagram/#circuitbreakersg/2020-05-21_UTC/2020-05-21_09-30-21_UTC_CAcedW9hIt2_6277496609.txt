One of my favourite delis, Pret, released the recipe for their dark chocolate chunk cookie so I just had to try it. And it goes like this ðŸ˜˜.
.
INGREDIENTS
110g Unsalted Butter
170g Caster Sugar
85g Light Brown Sugar
1  Egg
190g Self-Raising Flour
3g Salt
120g Large Dark Chocolate Buttons
.
Beat melted butter with caster and brown sugars until well combined.
Add the egg and continue to beat until just incorporated. 
Add flour and salt and mix until smooth dough.
Add the choc buttons and combine with your hands (I used spatula).
You could roll out small balls of the dough on the baking tray (lined with baking paper). I just used ice cream scoop. Make sure you space them apart as the dough will flatten and spread out in the oven.
Bake at 180 deg C for about 15mins until the cookies look golden.
