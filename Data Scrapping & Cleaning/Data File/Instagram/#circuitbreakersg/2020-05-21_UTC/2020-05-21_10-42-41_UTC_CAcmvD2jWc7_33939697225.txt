~ Pad Kra Pao Gai ~ It's Thai Thursday today. Made a toddler version of stir-fried basil chicken for dinner. It's lighter in colour because of the absence of heavy seasonings. But even without it, the taste is not compromised which is the most important. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #padkrapao #thaifood #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
