Day 45 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (21 May 2020 - #nofilter #easypeasy #quicklunch prepared in less than 10 minutes (including the time needed to boil water) using #homemade #bolognese #ragu made before the lockdown, almost 2 months ago, tossed with #fettucine and a couple of tablespoons of #mascarpone and some pasta water. #frozenfood can be so #yummy ! Definitely worth the hours of preparation, months ago, to freeze many servings of this! This is #先苦后甜 as the Chinese saying goes; with the earlier hard work, now I can enjoy #restaurantquality #homecooked food anytime! #stayhomestaysafe everyone! #homecooking
