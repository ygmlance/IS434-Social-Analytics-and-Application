This time round, we would like to express our appreciation and encouragement to the many unsung and invisible super heroes from various industries such as healthcare, transport, environment, security services, food services, social services, migrant workers, safe distancing ambassadors and different groups of volunteers for their determination and sacrifices made to keep Singapore safe whilst ensuring our people's daily essential needs are met as we fight and overcome this pandemic together! ðŸ’ª
