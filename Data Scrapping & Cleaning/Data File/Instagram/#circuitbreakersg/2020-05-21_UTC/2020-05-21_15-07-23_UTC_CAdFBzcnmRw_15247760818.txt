A warming bowl of double-boiled herbal black chicken soup does wonders for the soul! My persistent flu disappeared thereafter and I literally felt warm (took it as a sign that my blood must be in good circulation 🥰. Added dang gui, dang shen, chuan xiong, ginseng root, red dates and wolfberries (mostly from my parents). Love that the different sizes of my @wmf_sg pots come in very handy for double boiling! On the other hand, it’s also about unlocking another culinary level and looking at food from a totally different perspective. Got this fresh whole black chicken from @keesonggroup on @redmartcom and this was my first time chopping and cleaning out a whole chicken (including the head, claws and innards) 😧. Was more traumatising than I expected, especially when I usually do not like to see the face of our food (usual suspects would be fish fillets, chicken thighs 😝) and I was thinking about all the pet chickens 🐓😅☹️ which I saw recently and the occasional visiting black pigeon/mynah on the ledge... doesn’t help that the rooster 🐔 is my Chinese zodiac animal too... 🤭Mixed feelings about making this meal aside, it was sure good for nourishing the body and the plentiful meat fell right off the bone! 😊 The chicken was really fresh too. Recall having this more often when I was young, and the homecooked version is always better than those sold outside as there’s so much more meat rather than skin (which I will not eat coz it’s slimey, unless it’s roasted or fried) 😐Had a certain sense of accomplishment too by overcoming this fear (albeit a little squeamishly). Will definitely ask the butcher to do the tough job (respect! 👏🏻) at the wet market next time or just simply buy chicken thighs at the supermart/online! Hmmmz, just remembered there’s another whole chicken in the freezer! 😅 the hubs kindly offered to help me the next time round, but it’s alright. I think I can do it one more time. 😂 Anyway, I have a newfound appreciation for the food we eat. Had a conversation with a friend who resists the idea of eating black chicken due to its colour, and will just drink the soup. I can totally understand that. Do you have the fear of eating black chicken too? 😊
