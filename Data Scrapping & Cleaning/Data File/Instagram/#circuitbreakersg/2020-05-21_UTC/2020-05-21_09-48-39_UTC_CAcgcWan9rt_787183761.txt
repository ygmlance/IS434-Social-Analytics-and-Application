A short workout session with Ringfit Adventure before lunch ðŸ˜… Thought it was a pretty good buy before the circuit breaker starts. Ideal for people who does not head to gym or self motivation to push yourselves during workout. There are challenges like to complete a session within a limited time frame or â€˜run afterâ€™ a chest for moneyðŸ’°Itâ€™s a mixture of Cardio and Strength, but mainly strength training. You can adjust the difficulty level too. Mine wasnâ€™t very high ðŸ˜³
Sensor is pretty accurate and swift too. Mr actually work out with this too since the gym is closed. ðŸ˜…
