Ever wonder what is love? True love.⁠
⁠
Is it just a physical attraction? Is it that “spark”? Is it a feeling of happiness?⁠
⁠
The sad reality is: the concept of love is being “sold” to us – in books, movies and dramas.⁠
⁠
This made us have unrealistic expectations for our significant others. Made us wear rose-tinted glasses. Made us fantasies a bed of roses in the future. ⁠
⁠
How can you differentiate between love and lust?⁠
⁠
Join us in this interactive conversation. Share stories and learn from the experiences of real people, from people who are just like you!⁠
⁠
What happens when you are able to differentiate between love and lust? ⁠
You will:⁠
✔️Be able to see the person for who they truly are⁠
✔️Have realistic expectations about relationships and romance (we will bust some ‘happily ever after’ bullshi*ts)⁠
✔️Save yourself from all the dramas that arise due to breakup ⁠
