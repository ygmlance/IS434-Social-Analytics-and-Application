P1 of a 2 part series; Beauty is only skindeep - or is it? Major flashbacks to our pasts; i can't believe how geeky @chongeileen was and how our (late) teen years were SO DIFFERENT. 
Also, you literally couldn’t have paid me to remove my eyeliner on cam 3 years ago. In the past years, i’ve shed a lotta the conditioning, expectations and my own beliefs about how i needed to look to be confident, liked, loved. In turn i learned that i am worthy, regardless of my weight, height, “life progress” (wtheck why am i judging myself right) and remembering that there’s a lot of Ling left to give to the world 🥳

I’m glad I can have a good laugh at myself now and not feel any less :) #celebrate
