One of @patricoantonioâ€™s best qualities is remembering the little remarks that I make. He can use what I say against me (he does, jokingly, on some occasions), but he mostly remembers my ramblings to pamper me. .

I may have casually mentioned craving steak and fennel salad on several occasions, which was probably why Patrick whipped that up for me before I left for home because #CircuitBreakerSG. .
.
Needless to say, the steak was perfectly cooked, the fennel salad was well seasoned, and I was very well fed. .
.
This was the last home-cooked meal Iâ€™ve had at Patrickâ€™s in almost two months now, and I canâ€™t wait to be back with him after the restrictions are lifted. After all, Patrickâ€™s cooking is best experienced fresh from the kitchen. ðŸ˜„

Made by him, shot by me.
