2nd project using @craftershub_craftershub yarn completed! 🌟
Project: Tshirt yarn basket with navy accent. 6mm hook. Diameter: 5", height: 2.5" 🧺👕
Inspired by #crochetnestingbaskets pattern on @yarnspirations, with some help from video guide by @bellacococrochet 🧶
I had an oval-base nesting basket in mind when placing the tshirt yarn order, to declutter a display section at my built-in cabinet. The skein came up to be much smaller than expected (~30m), hence the change of plan to a small round-base one. I decided against buying more skeins as the intention was to try out various yarn types to decipher which best to use for future projects.
Pattern was easy and simple to follow, until the last part on reverse sc where the video guide came in handy.
Unfortunately, the yarn came up short and I couldnt finish up the last round (swipe left!!!), so change of plans again! I used the yarn scraps from the tote project and finished off with a round of sc and sl st instead of the original reverse st. The less chunky 16ply yarn vs tshirt yarn resulted in a slight turning in of the basket walls and, together with the navy accent, lends some character to the final product. I wld have preferred a basket with more defined patterns from the sc, so prob need to try out more yarns to find a more suitable one (note: red heart strata yarn). This project also marks my 1st attempt at colour change ✅
🍋 the basket still comes in handy and is now sitting on my side table, keeping all the phone chargers and wires in place 🍋
