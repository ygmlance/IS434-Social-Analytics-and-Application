As Singapore continues to stay in circuit breaker / lockdown, the wild flowers and plants are starting to grow on the sidewalks and grass verges, giving the streetscape a more natural look. Spotted some of them these two weeks. We should really not be too eager to keep trimming and cutting them. So much beauty in nature. 🌺🍃🌱 #路边的野花不要采 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #singapore
