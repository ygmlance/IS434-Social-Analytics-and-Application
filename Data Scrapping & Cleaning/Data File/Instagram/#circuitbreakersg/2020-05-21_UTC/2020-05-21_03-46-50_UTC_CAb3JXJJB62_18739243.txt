It's no wonder that our little one is such a dynamic kinesthetic & active learner - he's been on the move since doing trauma fellowship with me in Western Sydney! Super happy to see him 'graduating' from infancy to junior toddlerhood soon. Please give us a chance to catch up with your breathtaking growth & ever-amusing antics whenever your parents are home ok? #busybee #inaction #maybabiesrock #timeflieswhenyourehavingfun #circuitbreakersg #babyALQE #milestonesachieved
