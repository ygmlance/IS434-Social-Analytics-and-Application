It's world cultural day today! 🎎 This is probably the most cultural food I've made recently ahahah. Even though the last time I folded dumplings was more than a year ago, I think I still have the muscle memory!! ✌🏻 It's crazy how eating certain food can transport you anywhere in the world, and this one brings me right back to Japan.... just what I need right now 💭🥟🥢
