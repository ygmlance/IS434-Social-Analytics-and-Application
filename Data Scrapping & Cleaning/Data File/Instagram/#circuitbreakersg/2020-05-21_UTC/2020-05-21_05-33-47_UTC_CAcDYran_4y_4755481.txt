Lunch. An attempt at #japanesesandwich 
#katsusando or #porkcutlet #sandwich, and #tamagosando or #eggmayosandwich 
I undercooked my #eggs and cba to make new eggs especially since that might mean another #groceryrun to restock. So #itiswhatitis 
The #porkcutlet was #premade and retrieved #fromthefreezer 
Other people’s pork cutlets look so thick but I wonder if it’s difficult to bite through. Will need to make one thick one to find out. All in the name of research of course. 
Washed down with #misosoup with #tofu
