Sharing my mum’s Homemade Ngoh Hiang recipe here: (can make about 13-15 rolls)

Ingredients for step 1:
Minced Pork collar - 1Kg (got the pork collar from Porkchick, check out their fb page)
Fish paste - 500g (we use @freshfood_mrjoy’s fish paste - $3.95/packet 500g)
1 Big egg or 2 small eggs

Ingredients for step 2:
7 tablespoon of rice flour 
7 tablespoon of plain flour

Ingredients for step 3:
3 pc garlics 
1 big onion
1/3 red carrot 
15 pcs Water chestnut 
8 pcs Dried shiitake mushroom 
Optional: Shrimps

Ingredients for step 4:
Dried beancurd skin (got it from @noodleman678)

Seasoning: 
Five spice powder - 1 teaspoon
Light sauce - 1 tablespoon 
Dark sauce - 1/2 tablespoon
Sesame oil - 2 teaspoon 
White pepper - 1/2 teaspoon (or your preference) 
White sugar - 2 teaspoons 
Salt - 1 teaspoon

Method:
Step 1: 
Mix ingredients for step 1 and seasoning well until smooth. The mix should be a little “elastic”

Step 2: 
Sift both flour and add flour to the mix. Mix well until no traces of flour is visible.

Step 3: 
Chop the garlic and onions. Dice remaining ingredients for step 3. Add in all the chopped & diced ingredients to the mix and mix well. The Ngoh Hiang mix is done and you can proceed to making the roll with bean curd skin. (You may want to wipe the skin first with damp paper towel as the beancurd skin is quite salty)

Last step: 
Roll and steam for 15 mins [Alternate cooking method: 
You can also make meatballs with the mix. Roll into ball shape and coat with bread crumbs. Deep fry]

You can keep the mix in freezer for up to a month.
