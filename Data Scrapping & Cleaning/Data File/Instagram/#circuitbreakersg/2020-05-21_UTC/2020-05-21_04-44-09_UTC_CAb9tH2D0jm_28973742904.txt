Missed stir-fried Shanghai noodles from a restaurant at Ngee Ann City so decided to replicate this in my kitchen today. I usually have to remind the staff to cut back on the oil. But in my kitchen, everything is under my control. ðŸ˜‚

This dish is made up of few ingredients - udon, pork slices, bok choy, chinese cabbage, sliced pork and shitake mushrooms (omitted this from my version as Mr K is not fan).
