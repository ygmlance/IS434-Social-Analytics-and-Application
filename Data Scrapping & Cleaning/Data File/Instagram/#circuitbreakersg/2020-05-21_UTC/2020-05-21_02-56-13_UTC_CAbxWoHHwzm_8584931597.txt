*Working on existing orders; please leave me a message but putting new orders on hold for the next few days*

Hi everyone! Thank you for your support and ðŸ’›. I can understand how challenging it seems as we move towards exiting the circuit breaker. We are all stepping into unchartered territories and making new decisions as the situation unfolds and more information becomes available to us.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Sewing machines are probably all working over time as makers receive requests for reusable fabric masks. In order to concentrate on fulfilling my existing orders, I will be putting new orders on hold for a little while. Iâ€™d be grateful for your continued support but if you urgently require a mask, please make sure you get one, donâ€™t wait. We should all have one already from the government and thereâ€™s another one coming soon.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
As we embrace the use of reusable fabric masks, keep in mind that there are many areas in our lives where we can swap out single-use for reusables. The financial upfront cost is higher and it requires more resources to make, but if you take care of it and use it for as long as possible, cost per use goes down and the environmental cost of dealing with single-use reduces.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Iâ€™m not saying donâ€™t get food delivery (which typically comes in single-use plastic), Iâ€™m saying consider alternatives like establishments that partner with @muuse.io, support restaurants or hawkers in your neighbour by bringing your own, and get food delivery from further away less frequently. We are lucky to have many options available within a walking 10 minute radius but if that isnâ€™t the case for you, simply being more mindful of single use and waste will go along way.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Thanks for believing in me and what I do and thank you for your patience. I will officially accept new orders soon so bear with me. Have a lovely day! ðŸ¤—ðŸ’›ðŸŒˆ
