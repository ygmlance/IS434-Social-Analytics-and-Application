“Sound of  Music” remains my all time favorite movie and I love the lyrics in this song “My Favourite Things”. I was humming it as I piped the flowers and let me boldly rewrite a verse to describe how I felt. 🤗 {Rain drops on roses and butterflies on peonies,
Bright copper whisker and hot pot of jelly, 
Pink paper boxes are tied up with strings...
These are a few of my favorite things....} I’ll to name this piece of JellyCake as “Sound of Music”. (6” Lychee & Coconut Milk)
