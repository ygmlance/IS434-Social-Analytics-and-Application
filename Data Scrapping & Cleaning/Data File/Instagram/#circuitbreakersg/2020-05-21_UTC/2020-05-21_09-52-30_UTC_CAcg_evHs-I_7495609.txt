Their simplest & happiest joy - outdoor, which before the #circuitbreakersg was taken for granted. Now, they appreciate every chance of going outdoor, especially to the park. .
#charmerteo felt so much better after his cycling. When asked “how do u feel today?” His reply “good... but can be better...” #louisateo was like “mama, when can we go home, I’m tired...”

Loving the park. Loving the nature.
