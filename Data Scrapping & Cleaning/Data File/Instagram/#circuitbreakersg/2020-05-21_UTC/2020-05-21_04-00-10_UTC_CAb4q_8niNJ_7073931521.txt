Rearranged my book shelf yesterday. Wondering how I got that many red books and only one green book which I barely can digest (cos it’s business strategy. In Japanese. Thank you @thephenom_ac) 
On a side note, less than 2 weeks before the end of circuit breaker, how’s everyone holding up? I know I am getting fat. ✌🏻 #fatshamingself
