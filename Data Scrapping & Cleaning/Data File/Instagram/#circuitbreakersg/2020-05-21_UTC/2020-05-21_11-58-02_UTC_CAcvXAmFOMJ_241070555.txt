For #evvirtualgamesnight this week, we went back to school at Eaglesview Academy. ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦… Our teachers @heyrenahere  and @calvintkw_ made the "lessons" super fun. Our patriotism was put to the test when we had to complete national day songs and team up to form unique shapes via zoom. Overall, had lots of fun and can't wait for the next one!! Thanks @jeric_koh for stopping by the Academy. Thanks Rena & Calvin for all the planning!
