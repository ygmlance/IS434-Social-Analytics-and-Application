Champagne Brut de Boerl & Kroff 2012. Lovely bouquet of citrus, orange peel, tangerine, cranberry, baked apple, toast, brioche (floral, citrus, oaky and vegetal with some spices, in a way complex nose) made me excited already! (I should admit that I’m biased when it comes to 🥂) On the palate, bubble was fine and smooth, I quite like it with a bit of raw texture, dense, dry, rich but at the same time lean and elegant in style. Lingering was super long with minerality burst on the palate. Of course, good acidity on the backbone. Still young but will get better with cellaring or decanting needed. Amazing experience to lift up my gloomy mood during CB 🙆🏻‍♀️ Chloe’s Score 4.0/5 available @gcwines
