Obsession Session IPA by Fixation Brewing 🇦🇺🍺
⁣
Brewed with Simcoe, Galaxy and Mosaic hops, its resinous and fruity notes combine to make this beer taste almost weedy, but it's not too dank at a very quaffable 4.6% ABV.
⁣
As the can art suggests, this is the perfect beer to lounge with as you indulge in its buffet of hops. An automatic inclusion on the long list of great Australian craft beers! ⁣
