Day 45 : Throw back 2011. The overseas pre wedding destination supposed to be in Tokyo- Mt Fuji. But 2 weeks before our trip, Tohoku earthquake and tsunami happened. We decided to change our travel destination to Perth. 
It was my 1st trip to Perth, and I didnâ€™t expect the super dry and ðŸŒ¬ windy weather there.It was really fun and tiring for a self drive pre wedding trip. I remembered that we went  to a scary & quiet old town, after that we only realized that the town was burnt down some times back and most of the resident moved out. ðŸ‘»The town was really creepy and we run away after a few quick shots. ðŸ˜±
