The best tuna salad on more toasty buttery homemade bread! This is so easy and quick to make, and so satisfying to eat‚Å£‚Å£. Great use of those #pantrystaples‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
You'll need the basics:‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
- A can of tuna - mine's from @ayambrandsg ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£üêì
- An apple, cut into small pieces (green ideally, but red works too! I used red here because that's what I had) ‚Å£‚Å£ ‚Å£
‚Å£
I know an apple in tuna salad sounds weird if you've never had it before, but it is amazing (!) and provides a lovely crunch to an otherwise mushy spread. Some like to use celery but I don't often have celery lying around ‚Å£
‚Å£
- Kewpie mayo, salt, pepper, 1 squish's worth of lemon juice ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
- Scallions ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
The luxuries, if you have them:‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
- capers, chopped dill, pickled red onions‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
Mix everything together and slather onto freshly toasted bread. Or: eat with crackers, in lettuce wraps, straight from the bowl‚Å£‚Å£
