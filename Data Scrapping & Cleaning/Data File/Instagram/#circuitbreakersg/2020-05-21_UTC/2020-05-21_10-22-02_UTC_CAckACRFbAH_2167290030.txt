DAY 44, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
Hello peeps!
Here is a video I featured in, for a supermarket long ago. My 5 minutes of fame ðŸ˜Š 
Thankyou Anil ji for the opportunity!
I made dosa spring rolls today after a long long time, so thought it would be nice to share the video with you. 
Yes I look fat, because I was going through health issues back then, and was about 72kg ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜‚!!
Tell me if you try these at home! .
