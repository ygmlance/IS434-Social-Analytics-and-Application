It doesn't fit properly (in this pic I placed it upside down, but I subsequently reoriented it correctly), and it looks tacky. Bare black acrylic plate looks fine on its own. And of course, now that the innards are no longer protected by a boot, best to drape a cover over it after use, lest you get dust, bugs, and other crap falling into it. \ud83d\ude0e [/end]",

Now that I have an idea how fast these things wear out, they are practically consumables that need to be replaced often, and that would drive up the cost of ownership even more. If that's the case, what's stopping people from getting Chinese clones for 1/3 the price? I can understand the limitations from the supplier's perspective, but from a consumer's point of view, they need up their game and make their stuff out of moulded plastics. 3D printed products just don't seem to be durable enough, or suitable for this application. All this, IMHO.",
