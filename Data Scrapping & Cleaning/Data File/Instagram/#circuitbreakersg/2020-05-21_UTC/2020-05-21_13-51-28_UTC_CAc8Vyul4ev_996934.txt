#circuitbreakerday45 // Absolutely delicious #bluepeabread from @crustoncrumb, with leftover cheese (#gruyère scraps, a hollowed-out #lancashirebomb) and some fresh #primosale studded with mulberries from @thecheeseark. .
A welcome 10-minute respite in a 8.30am-to-midnight work day of back-to-back Skype and Teams calls: caught the New Yorkers as they were settling down for the night, then the people in Vancouver as they were ending work, then the Sydneysiders just before their lunch, then the Tokyoites before *their* lunch, then the Chinese and Vietnamese before theirs, then the Indians after theirs, the English as they were getting into work, then the New Yorkers again as they started work. .
Time-zones remind us of how vast this planet is. But our ability to communicate and empathise with each other (and bake bread and make cheese, albeit with different ingredients and techniques) reminds us of our shared humanity in Adam.

We were discussing our union with Adam at yesterday’s #unionschooloftheology #summerschool2020. .
With the headspace that comes with #lockdownlife, it became clear to many of us how much we’ve inherited Adam’s traits, internationally:
• our common suspicion of God’s goodness and wisdom - surely we selfish limited beings know what’s best for ourselves, not the eternal loving God;
• our common selfishness that prefers our desires and comfort over that of others (no matter how much we say we love them);
• our common self-righteousness - only we are just right, everyone else is wrong: the people driving faster than us are reckless, the people driving slower than us are idiots, etc;
• our common slavery to all this sin - no matter how hard we try (if we try at all), we continue to act this way every.single.day...
.
...which is why the Christian’s miraculous union with Christ is such #goodnews! Christ’s perfect life becomes ours, Christ’s payment of death is counted to us, Christ’s resurrection is ours to enjoy, Christ’s righteous inheritance is shared with us; and in the here-and-now, we have a #goodshepherd who guides us and helps us navigate the #valleyoftheshadowofdeath as we continue to struggle in Adam’s world.
