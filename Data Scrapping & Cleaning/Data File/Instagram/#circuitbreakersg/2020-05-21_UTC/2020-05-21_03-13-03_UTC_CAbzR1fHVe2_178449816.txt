Day 44 of #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It may seem like I cook a lot but the truth is I often stick to our familiar favourites. Seafood is one area I’ve hardly ventured into, but yet something we love to eat.
.
Decided to try cooking some calamari yesterday. Not as difficult as I feared. The squid already came pre cleaned and cut up. All I had to do was to dredge them in a flour spice mix. I just put in whatever I have on hand which is coriander powder, paprika, pepper and salt.
.
Got the smallest pot avail but still had to chug in quite a bit of oil. I tilted the pot slightly to save on oil! Frying was super easy. Couple of minutes and done!!
.
Btw the chunkier ones are actually shiitake mushrooms. Those I added some milk to the flour mix hence a thicker batter than the squid.
.
So where’s your favourite restaurant to eat Calamari?
