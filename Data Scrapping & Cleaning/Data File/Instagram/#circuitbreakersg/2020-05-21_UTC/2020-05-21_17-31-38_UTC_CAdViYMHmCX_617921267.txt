Rice Broth. Or Teochew Porridge, as how we Chinese call it. Perfect for those hot, humid days (Interesting, but its one of the ways Chinese use food to recalibrate the taste buds when the relentless heat wave makes one feel sluggish).
. 
Taiwanese like to have their plain watery Rice Broth balanced out with some robust side dishes. I've ordered their Oyster Egg Omelette and Marmite Chicken to go with my plain porridge since this restaurant does the Taiwanese style.
. 
The right match for my taste buds: Pipping Hot. Tasty. Not too Salty. Satisfying. Sensible Portions and Price.😋 Try it!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
