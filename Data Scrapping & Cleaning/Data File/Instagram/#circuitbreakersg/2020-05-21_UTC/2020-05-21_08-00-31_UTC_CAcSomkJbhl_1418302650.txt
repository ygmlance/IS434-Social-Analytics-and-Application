Come 1 June, Singapore will lift the #circuitbreakersg and some activities will resume. Unfortunately, exercise and recreation activities will resume only a few weeks after, I’m anticipating July. It’s great most of us have embraced #virtualclasses and this platform offers a great alternative for #exerciseenthusiasts who don’t want to stop moving.  Join a #zumbavirtualclass now because for every participant, #zumba is providing a free meal through the #globalfoodbankingnetwork to serve the less fortunate. Make #yourmovesmatter.
