Today I'm back at our favourite place for yes, lechon!  @lechonrepublicsg you have outdone yourself tonight... The crackling was on point!  And I don't even love crackling...
Cooked so much chap chye (braised vegetables) that I still have tubs of it in the freezer, so warmed up one since it's one of @iamivanlau's favourite dishes...
Voila!  We have a quick and easy meal for day 45! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
