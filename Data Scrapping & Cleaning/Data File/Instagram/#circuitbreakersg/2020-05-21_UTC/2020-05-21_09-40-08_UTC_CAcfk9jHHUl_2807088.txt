This week on ‘Real Moms of Quarantine’ I’ll be chatting with fellow momma @amyjcheng to find out how she’s been doing this CB. I’ll also be talking to anxiety coach Shoni @twelveinchesaway to learn helpful ways to deal with the stress we’re all under so that we stay mentally and emotionally healthy in the midst of this pandemic! This is really helpful stuff for everyone, not just moms, so feel free to pop in to pick up some tips or ask a question tomorrow 10pm on my IG live!
