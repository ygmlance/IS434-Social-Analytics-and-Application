#WFH Pilates tips: Neck ache from looking down all day at your laptop? Try this move - Loop the resistance band over your head, and press repeatedly against it, eye gaze forward. This strengthens the neck extensors that may have been lengthened after prolonged flexion of the neck. You can also try this by standing against a wall, with a soft ball behind your head, and gently pressing your head into the ball. Try it, your neck will thank you!
