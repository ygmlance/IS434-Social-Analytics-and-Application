Hello guys! 🏊‍♂️ My first post for this month; it’s been a while! Circuit Breaker in Singapore is coming to an end, and I’ll definitely miss the fun times I’ve shared with Mama and Papa. Last weekend our indoor inflatable pool finally arrived (after a whole month!) and I had a whale of a time splashing around 💦 it was such a chill afternoon! I hope I’ll get to swim (or rather, crawl/walk in the water) again soon 😇😂
