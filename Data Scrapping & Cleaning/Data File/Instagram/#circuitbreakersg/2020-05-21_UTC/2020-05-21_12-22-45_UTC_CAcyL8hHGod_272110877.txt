Day 43. Every morning we woke up with anticipation of the type of morning sky we will see. No disappointment so far. Lunch - Missy asked me to prepare a simple rice bowl with lots of spam and one other ingredient. So she had it. Spam + fried eggs. Mr. and myself rushed out to get dinner and the littlest one followed us to the doorstep. Then he was distracted by his treats. In the end, we bought burgers and fries from McDonalds. It was a delicious meal since we ate from Mac 3 months back. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #mybunnyathome #instadaily
