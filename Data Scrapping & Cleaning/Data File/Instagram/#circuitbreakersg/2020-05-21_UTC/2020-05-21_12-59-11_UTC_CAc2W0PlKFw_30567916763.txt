#circuitbreakersg day 45

Haven’t had prawns in a while so decided to make some Phoenix prawn tails 炸虾球 🍤 for dinner. This dish brings back happy memories as my mum used to cook it for special occasions when I was young. 😊

Cooked a simple vegetable stir-fry with the prawn heads and it’s really tasty too. 😋

Do you use prawn heads in your cooking too? 🦐 .

I’m grateful that it’s almost the weekend and I have plans with my friends for a virtual karaoke session! 🎤 🎶 #gratitudediary
