My 2nd attempt preparing barbecue pork aka char siew, so happy it turns out nicely and taste so delicious.😋
.
This time the meat is nicely char, tender and juicy and thumbs up from family, at least my effort not wasted. IMO the most important part of cooking is when others enjoy it. 🥰
.
I am using a different cut of pork meat, instead of pork butt/shoulder, I bought a slightly fatty cut which they call it “不见天”. Also made some changes to the recipe, use maltose instead of honey, and replace oyster sauce with hoisin instead. But the most important part is still the bake/roasting, I added a cup of water on the tray which keeps the meat moist.
.
As always I still think there is room for improvement, some may know I am a perfectionist, not good I will keep trying till I get it right. 😉
