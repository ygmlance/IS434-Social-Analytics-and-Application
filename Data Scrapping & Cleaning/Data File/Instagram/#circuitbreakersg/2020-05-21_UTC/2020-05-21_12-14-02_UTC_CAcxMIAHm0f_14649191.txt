You know the pictures you see on social media, where you see that people have crammed cups of bubble tea into their fridge? You might have said to yourself, “Those people are crazy!” .

Well, I’m one of those people. 😂😂 (especially since my family also comprises of bubble tea lovers)
.

The night it was announced that bubble tea shops would be shut down during the circuit breaker, I was in the middle of teaching my online class so I literally had no idea till an hour or two after everyone else. Thank goodness my brother had earlier predicted that there might be a closure and ordered us a bunch of Gong Cha to tide us through.
