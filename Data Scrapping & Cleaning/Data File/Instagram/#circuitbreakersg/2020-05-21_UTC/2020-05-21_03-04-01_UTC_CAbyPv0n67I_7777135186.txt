SUSTAINABLE FASHION MATTERS 👏
✨✨
What does sustainable fashion really mean?
• For you as a consumer, this means thinking about what you buy (buying what you need) & knowing which philosophies you're supporting when you purchase an item e.g. slow fashion, fair fashion, or even shopping local.
• For us as a collective, this means supporting and bringing to you designers and makers who consider people & planet in their creations.
✨✨
Can we really make a change?
• Yes! Fashion is really a consumer-facing industry, and consumers have real power to demand changes through making conscious choices. Designers and makers who intentionally minimise harm to people & planet contribute to cleaning up the industry.
✨✨
And as always, with that in mind, we invite you to join us in making that change 💛🧡
