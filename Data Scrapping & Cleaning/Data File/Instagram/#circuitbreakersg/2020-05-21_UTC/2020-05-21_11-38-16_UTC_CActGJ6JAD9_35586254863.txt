The school system is terrible. 
Firstly, The government merely focuses on the top 50% and neglects the rest. They project this aura of superiority towards the rest of the world. “Oh look at our students, they’re top in global test” and they buy into this bullshit. I was shocked when I first knew my first neighbourhood school friends. They were just normal. As such, they’re looked down upon by so-called elite schools. I know, because I once looked down on them too, and I’m sure many singaporeans do too.
Secondly, there is way too much emphasis on marks. The government may try to bluff and sugarcoat the truth but if you don’t get good marks for your major exams(O levels, A levels), you’re fucked. Good luck next year as a private candidate or go to ITE. A lot of my friends are depressed. We study so much just to repeat it every 6 months. We may look happy and cheerful on the outside but we feel like absolute shit on the inside.
Thirdly, there is 0 emphasis on the arts. When I was young, I used to play piano and enjoyed it. Then, in secondary 1 and 2, the music Teachers just asked us to play with boomywackers for an hour each week. It blows my mind how irrelevant the arts is seen as. Sure, there are courses in poly and O level music and art, but by then, I’ve lost all interest and just morphed into a mindless zombie, perfect for studying and listening to orders.

Thanks for listening to this ramble. Of course these will never change because we are a country proud of churning out efficient citizens that do everything they say. It’s great for the GDP but terrible for our personal lives.
