(Ignore my #rbf please) Challenged myself to learn how to do the splits during the #circuitbreaker period. Finally got my splits in 2 weeks with the help of #aloyoga 15-minute split stretches (didnâ€™t do it everyday though ðŸ˜œ).
The first picture was just taken today;
the second picture was taken on Apr 29 and it was the day I started practising splits;
the third was taken on May 5; 
the forth on May 7;
and the last one on May 11.
This is the video I learned my splits from (https://youtu.be/kpLEi6eqonE). Highly recommend! .
