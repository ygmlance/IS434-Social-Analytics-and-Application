Had some time this morning , quickly looked for a easy recipe for muffins so I can bake together with korkor while K2 was at the doctor. 
I prepared the ingredients and he did most of the work😀 ,had a great chitchat session coz my Korkor will ask me 101 Questions 🙂Glad we had this bonding session. ❤️
As u can see, 2 banana chocolate muffins are missing on the plate, it’s in mummy’s tummy coz  I have to check and make sure it’s cooked and edible 😃 and it turned out surprisingly nice , chocolates are a must !
