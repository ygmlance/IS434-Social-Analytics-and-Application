Like most ppl, I haven’t stepped out of my house much for the past couple of months. A couple of times I did to get some vitamin D, i was treated to the sight of butterflies fluttering around (in twos or more no less!) in a sign of summer/life. I would never have appreciated such a sight before CCB, mainly because I wouldn’t just be standing still in the sun, to observe. Would be bustling about like these butterflies, except in a concrete jungle. “What a beautiful hue this one has”, I thought to myself, as I retreated back into shade to fleetingly ponder the vagaries of life, before my attention was called back to the sea of words on my laptop requiring attention. 🙄 #random #randomthoughts #butterflies #randommusings #life #sg #sgig #igsg #covid19begone #covid19 #mindfulness  #mindfulliving #circuitbreakersg #ccbsg
