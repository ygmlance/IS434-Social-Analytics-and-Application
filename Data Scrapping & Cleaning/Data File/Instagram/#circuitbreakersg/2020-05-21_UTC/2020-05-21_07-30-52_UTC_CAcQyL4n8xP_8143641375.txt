Getting my (online) kombucha fix from @teapulse  that celebrates it's 1st year anniversary since rebranding itself from TeaBrick. 
Specialising in fermented drinks such as Kombucha as well as lemonade. 
It's definitely much healthier than your conventional boba/bubbletea but hopefully more people regardless of age or race would catch on this trend.
With the pandemic looming over our heads, best to eat & drink some healthy stuff regularly.
Order from teapulse.sg, minimum $30 order. Islandwide delivery.
