Char Siew Pork

This is rather a quick version of Char Siew pork that really well with rice or bread

Ingredients: 3 layer pork about 250g (1 pack from NTUC), shallots, onion, scallion

❶ marinate pork with salt for 1 hour or overnight
❷ boil pork with ginger, half cap of shaoxing wine and white part of scallion for 10 minutes
❸ slice pork into strips. slice shallots and minced onion.
❹ fry shallots till slightly brownish and add minced onion and continue to fry till onion is lightly transparent
❺ add pork strips, 100ml water, 2 tablespoon of dark soya sauce and 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce. Stir to mix well and cook with lowest fire for 30 minutes. Typically addition of sugar is normal but I am good with the sweetness coming from dark soya sauce. So sugar is fine but is optional.
❻ add soya sauce to taste and ready to serve
