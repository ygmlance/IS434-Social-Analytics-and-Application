Recently I learned a new term “cabin fever” from @mojojo_ing post.

J1 has been staying home for almost two months since March school holidays. She was a bit restless, lethargy (always telling me she’s tired) and decreased motivation for the past few weeks and I didn’t think much about it. She became easily agitated recently either by me or J2. She kept disturbing J2 and making him cry yesterday and irritated the hell out of me. And it hit me that she maybe having cabin fever.

So, Jack and I had a talk with her last night. We asked if she’s bored but she didn’t know the meaning. We asked if she wants to do something but don’t know what to do and she said yes. So I told her we shall do something different today and asked for her suggestions. She told me she wants to go out and play. I told her we can’t do that for now and she understood. (my poor girl) So, she asked for a change of all her toys. I rotated all her toys last night.

We had a baking session this morning. I brought out her dollhouse and told her she can play with it when J2 is napping. (There’s too many small parts in it). We had @dintaifungsg fried rice for lunch (requested by her)

It’s very challenging to find activities for both of them to do together. I tried letting them play with ice last evening and J2 wasn’t too impressed by it.

You can read more about cabin fever on the government website https://www.gov.sg/article/cabin-fever-101-are-you-feeling-it

It’s hard for the adults during #circuitbreakersg and I think it’s even harder for kids. Praying that this season will end soon!

On the other note, my butter cake had bubbles bubbling at the side.. 🤣🤣 I thought it’s total failure but still turns out nice and the kids were fighting over it.

Please share some activities that I can do with them together!
