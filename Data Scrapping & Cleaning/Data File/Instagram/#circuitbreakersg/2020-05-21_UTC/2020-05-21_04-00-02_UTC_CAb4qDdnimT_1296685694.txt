Dinner delivery from Saveur yesterday which I had fun re-plating again. 😄

My family enjoys dining at Saveur and their Duck Confit is our all time favourite. For our home delivery meal, we decided to order something different.
.

We ordered the Traditional French Pot Roasted Chicken 1.3kg that comes with root vegetables, potatoes & Herb Pilar Rice ($35, good for 2-4pax) and Chargrilled Australian Ribeye Steak 200g, served with choice of 
Sauce and Two Sides. ($22).
.

Saveur has recently launched their online food delivery store - shop.saveur.sg offering Islandwide Delivery. With this one-stop-shop, they are offering their Signature dishes & Ice Cream from their 4 Concepts namely Saveur, MediumRare, FrapasBar and Bread & Butterfly.
