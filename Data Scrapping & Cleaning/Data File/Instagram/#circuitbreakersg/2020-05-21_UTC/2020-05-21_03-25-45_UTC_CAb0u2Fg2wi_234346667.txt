Breakfast sandwiches! Possibly the most frequently made kind of breakfast for my family. Substantial, satisfying and great when paired with all of the breakfast ingredients. Like eggs, ham, smoked salmon, nutter-butter, avocado etc. 
These will keep the family full till late lunch and no snacking in between. Which is the whole idea because I don’t snack, thus the family as well😝. #honeybeemakesbreakfast #honeybeemakesbreakfastsanwiches 
These double eggs sandwiches are both equally hard to make and hard to take photos with 😂 小蛋一直要掉出来！But they are so delicious, so it’s all good. 
If you wonder how Long I boiled those mini quail’s eggs to get that soft creamy center, it’s 2 mins boil then pop into ice water. They are at room temp prior to boiling. 
Another 10 days till CB is over. But it’ll still take months before it gets back to normality. Hang in there and go make something yummy! Happy Thursday everyone!
