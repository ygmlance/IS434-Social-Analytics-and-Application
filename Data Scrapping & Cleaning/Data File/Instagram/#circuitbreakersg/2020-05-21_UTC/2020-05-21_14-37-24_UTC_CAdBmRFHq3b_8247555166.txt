Journey to the west, for @lees_confectionery! ❤️

Dale (S$8.00) - Matcha sponge cake, matcha white chocolate ganache, orange peel paste, reconstructed biscuit base. Finally managed to try their matcha creation after missing the previous Dale and Tree. And it’s a yay from me! The matcha profile here isn’t the intense kind. Instead, it’s soft, smooth and subtle, which I really enjoyed. The matcha sponge cake is light and fluffy, just like chiffon cake. As for the ganache, it has got to be the least sweet matcha ganache I’ve tried, and thus does not get cloying quickly. The orange peel paste provides a citrusy twist to this matcha creation, and I’m glad that the amount is quite minimal so it’s actually not that prominent. I also like how buttery and fragrant the reconstructed biscuit base is, with a perfectly crisp texture that’s not tough at all. To get the crumbly texture, sugar cookies are being smashed and then reassembled, something like making of a cheesecake base. Love this for its taste, cake > cream ratio (very little cream!) and that it’s not too milky for me! 🍵

Cube (S$8.00) - Hojicha dark chocolate mousse, dark chocolate caramel cream, brownie, chocolate crunchy. The tea notes for this are present, but rather mellow too. The hojicha dark chocolate mousse is a little too milky for me, but I enjoyed the dark chocolate caramel cream for its rich toffee taste. The fudgey texture of the brownie is also very much of a delight, so luscious and chocolatey. As for the chocolate crunchy, I like the crunch factor it adds and the salty tinge it gives to balance off the overall richness! 🍫

So are you team matcha or houjicha? It’s definitely matcha all the way for me! 😜
