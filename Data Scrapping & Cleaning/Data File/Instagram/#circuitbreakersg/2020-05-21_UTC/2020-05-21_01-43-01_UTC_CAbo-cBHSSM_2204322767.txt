Something quite tasty but I failed to make good photos with. 😅 What a disadvantage as dinner plates with weak light!
Salad was with shredded apple! I am going to steal this idea for my own salad.
Grilled eggplant was well soaked with oil and paste and it was flavourful.
And the beef was most delightful, even with that low profile look. I love it to be tendor.
