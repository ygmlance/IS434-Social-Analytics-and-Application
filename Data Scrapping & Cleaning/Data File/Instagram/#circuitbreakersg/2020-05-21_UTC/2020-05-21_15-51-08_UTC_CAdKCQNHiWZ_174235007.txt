Got this pizza together with the steak last week at @foodiemarketplacesg . As I still hv much blessed foodie left in the fridge , so I pop it in the oven while me and Isabella did a 20MIN workout before we indulge in it this afternoon . #timesaver #indulgenceonceinawhile #multitasking 
Only $6.90 (no additional toppings from me) and feeds both of us ( & we hv to ask the papa to help us finish up ) together with the blessed yummy chicken pie from Dino Cafe and egg tarts from @sweehengsg ðŸ˜‹#superyummy 
Cheers to our #selfmade #yuzulemon drink n #powerberries ðŸ¥° #strawberries #blueberries #cherries
