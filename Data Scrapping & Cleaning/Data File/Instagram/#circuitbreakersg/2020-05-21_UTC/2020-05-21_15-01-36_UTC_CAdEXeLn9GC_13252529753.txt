<Journey To The West> Book 1
Edited & Illustrated by Tsai Chih Chung
Translated by Alan Chong

I first introduced this story to my kids through the mandarin kids' version borrowed from @publiclibrarysg . I literally hunt down various branches just to get hold of a full series. I wonder why doesn't each branch carry a full set. 
After watching <Monkey Goes West> on Youtube with kids, my boy picked up my hubby's comic version and finished reading it by himself. Clearly, he loves the story.

Do catch the show by @wildricesg if you have not before 3pm Spore time. The show is 2.5hr long. I watched it live with hubby as our anniversary in 2014. Not sure when we can watch anothee production LIVE. In the meantime, enjoy the time spent at home. Stay safe, strong and sane!
