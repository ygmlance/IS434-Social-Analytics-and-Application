Dinner this evening, was a Sambal Belachan Fried Rice. Minced pork was first fried, and when it was almost ready, square cut white onions and minced garlic was added. When fragrant, refrigerated leftover rice was added, and a drizzle of fish sauce was used to season the rice. The rice was then stirred, and a depression was made in the centre of the rice, and beaten egg added. The eggs were stirred, and incorporated into the rice at high heat. Bean sprouts and chopped Chye Sim, or Mustard Greens were added, and mixed well. A generous dollop of Sambal Belachan, or Fermented Shrimp Chilli Paste was added and folded into the frying rice. Ready to serve when well incorporated, and fragrant. Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #sambalbelachanfriedrice #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
