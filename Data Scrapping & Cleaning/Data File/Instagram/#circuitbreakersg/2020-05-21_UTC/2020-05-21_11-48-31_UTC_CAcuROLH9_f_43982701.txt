Going to be long wait before we can dine in at our favorite zhi char store and certain dishes are best eaten hot from the stove like this salted egg prawns dish.  Crispy prawns coated in garlicky butter salted egg sauce but only lightly so as to retain the crunch. Made with salted egg powder from @emakuindonesia no msg and not too saltish. #saltedeggprawn #saltedegg #emakuindonesia #prawn #homecooking #sghomecooking #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeforsg #sgeats #sgfood #stfoodtrending #burpplesg #8dayseat #asianfood #eattheworld #sgfoodies #huffposttaste #buzzfeedfood #foodgram #foodphotography #beautifulcuisines #heresmyfood #foodandwine #feedfeed #f52grams #bonappetit #foodstagram #goodeats #foodiegram #gloobyfood
