i talk about religion a lot in this one—it’s been keeping me going
.
.
we’ve come to the final days of ramadan. these last couple of nights, as we’re all chasing for the blessings of laylatul qadr, i’ve found myself pondering over the concept of fate and predestination. qadr; or fate, predestination, power
.
.
the thing about anxiety, or at least my particular brand,  is that i need to constantly be in the know. i have to be in control and i almost always need to know what happens next—so i can preempt myself. because of this, i find the need to relax, be at peace, but most importantly to be rooted, present, and out of my head. all very difficult to do when you’re always on edge
.
.
there are very few instances where i feel present and calm at once. when i run, when i meditate, and when i pray
.
.
i think i’ve finally fully understand why believing in qada and qadr is so integral to the islamic faith. this act, this belief, seemingly so simple, is trusting that God knows all and has planned everything out for you. it’s understanding that He knows the path that’s best for you and inshaAllah He will guide you towards it. it’s trusting Him with your whole heart, soul, being
.
.
of course, this isn’t to say that you don’t have freedom of choice. you do. it’s like one of those choose your own adventure games, you know? each decision leads to a different outcome and so on. we just have to trust in the process and understand that we are all on our own journeys
.
.
in these last couple of nights, as we all chase for Laylatul Qadr, i’ve been praying for guidance. for peace.for the strength to let go and to trust in the Greatest Power i know. i’ve been acknowledging that only He truly knows best. i hope, if you’re a believer, that you are too x .
