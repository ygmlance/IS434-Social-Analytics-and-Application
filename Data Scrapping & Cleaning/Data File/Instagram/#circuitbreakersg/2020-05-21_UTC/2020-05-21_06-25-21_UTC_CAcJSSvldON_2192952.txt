Fried beehoon with #mungbean #beansprouts #homegrown with my kids right in our home. How amazing is that?! Too bad, my kids didn't enjoy the sprouts. Perhaps one day, they will. ðŸ™‚

These sprouts were soaked for 5 hrs on the first day, rinsed twice a day in a colander on subsequent days and were covered with a light-coloured kitchen towel at all times. Apparently the kettle method (in the absence of light) produces better sprouts with thicker stems.
