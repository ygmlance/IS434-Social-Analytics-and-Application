🕢Dinner: Hakka | Hand Shredded Salt Baked Chicken with Scallions Ginger Sauce.

Salt-baked chicken which known as as yim guk gai( 盐焗鸡). A Traditional Hakka salt baked chicken  is prepared by encasing the bird in the salt crust, the culinary tradition that stood the test of time until today since the Qing dynasty.

I stuffed my chicken with a bunch of scallions and ginger and marinate overnight with pre-prepared salt baked powder seasoning.

The dish does take some patience, but the effort is well worth it once you’re done. Throughout the entire cooking process, the aromas of the flavors filled our home

I hand shredded the chicken, although it isn’t the prettiest thing to do, but it is even more delicious in this way. The chicken is incredibly juicy and tender.

Dipping in @lennardy scallion ginger sauce, every bite is an explosion of flavor.

It’s  one of the greatest sauces that is full of flavor, and can put it on everything, even plain rice or noodles

Lip Smacking Good!
