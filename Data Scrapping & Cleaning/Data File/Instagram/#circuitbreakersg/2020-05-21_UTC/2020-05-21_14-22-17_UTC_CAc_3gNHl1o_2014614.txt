Happiness is having a Thai feast from the comfort of my home and pretending I’m in the 𝘓𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘚𝘮𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘴. 🏠🇹🇭 ⁣
⁣
We had the 𝐇𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐌𝐞𝐚𝐥 ($𝟐𝟗.𝟗𝟎) the other day which comprises 4 mains + 4 beverages. The Yammama and Garlic Chicken Ricebowl are my top picks! And of cos, a cuppa Thai Milk Tea and their signature Golden Toast are a must to complete your meal! ⁣
