So one thing about the old 2009 MacBook Pro that I bopian have to use now - the internal wifi card picharred long ago.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
To get online back then, I had to depend on this little external wifi dongle.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Long story about this dongle. Had bought and tried many different local brands but none of them were really Mac compatible. This one had to be bought on Amazom & shipped all the way from USA. (Think 2015. Amazon buying isn‚Äôt as convenient as now.)‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Fast forward to today.‚Å£‚Å£
Couldn‚Äôt find it. Haha.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Took me a long while ransacking the whole house before it resurfaced in the unlikeliest of places.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
And amazingly, it‚Äôs still working pretty well!‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
In fact, amazed that today has been a pretty productive day with this temporary setup of ancient replacement devices (incl the Gen 3 iPad Air to check/reply mails & do iCloud stuff)‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Small things like these to reminisce at are worth being thankful for.‚Å£‚Å£ ‚Å£‚Å£
