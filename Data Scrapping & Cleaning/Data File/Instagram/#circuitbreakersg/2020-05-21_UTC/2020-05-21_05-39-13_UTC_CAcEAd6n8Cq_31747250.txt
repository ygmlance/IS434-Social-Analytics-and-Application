Dad bought the Chinese style nasi lemak from the econ bee hoon stall. Sigh, told him umpteenth times not to buy me the nasi lemak here as they often undercook their rice which is hard in the middle but my words always fall on deaf ears. Having this always give me indigestion. And don’t get me started on that egg with the cooked yolk. Just give me my banana leave nasi lemak anytime. Tastier and cheaper-er too.
