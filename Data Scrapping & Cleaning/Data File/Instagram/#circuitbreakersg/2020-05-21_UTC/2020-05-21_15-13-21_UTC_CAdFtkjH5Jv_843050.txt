*CHEE CHEONG FUN*

Made CCF from scratch for last nightâ€™s dinner! It was SO TEDIOUS but fun lah. Those YouTube videos made it look too easy ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ but it really isnâ€™t so simple. Timing is everything and technique only gets better with failures haha! I made prawn & mushroom fillings, and the kids ate 2 each while we ate up the rest. Looks a bit ugly but thankfully the taste was not bad. 
One experience is good enough lol, Iâ€™ll gladly pay to eat good CCF in future!!! .
