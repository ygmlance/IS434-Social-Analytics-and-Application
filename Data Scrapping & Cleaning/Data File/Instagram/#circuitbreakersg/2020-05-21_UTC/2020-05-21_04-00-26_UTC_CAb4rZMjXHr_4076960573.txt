We'd like to share that we will be taking a break and will be on hiatus till August. ⁠
⁠
We want to thank you so much for your constant support and we hope we've helped you create many new memories.⁠
⁠
Till we see you again, go ahead and browse the many premium used strollers that we're letting go on sale on @pramwashsg 's page - visit our link in bio to check it out! ⁠
⁠
Its the final price reduction- go ahead and share with fellow mummies you know that will need this!⁠
⁠
P.S These used strollers have been pramwashed ever so often throughout its journey with us ☺️ ⁠
