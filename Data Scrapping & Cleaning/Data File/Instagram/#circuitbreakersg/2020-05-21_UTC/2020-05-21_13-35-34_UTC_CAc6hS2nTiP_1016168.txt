#Circuitbreakersg day 45

Why is it so hot? And the rain that comes and goes doesnâ€™t seem to help? Aaaaaargh .... oh, is this CB fatigue? Hahahahah

Dinner was ordered in & it was good : ðŸ”º Nasi Ambeng - a Traditional Javanese mixed rice platter served with curry, rendang, sambal goreng, bergedil & serunding.
& a bonus to have salted eggs & crunchy beansprouts with a generous sprinkle of chilli padi! 
A big portion XL size for 4 pax is good enuff to feed 6 pax goes for $55 with free delivery. No minimum order. ~
