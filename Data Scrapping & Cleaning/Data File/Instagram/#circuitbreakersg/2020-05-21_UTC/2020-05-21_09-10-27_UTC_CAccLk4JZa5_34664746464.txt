It’s afternoon break time 🍰+☕️+🌸=😻💯 These are definitely things that bring much joy to me, even on any bad day 💓 .

This week I’m feeling the drain balancing between mum duties & work duties. I have lots in my plate: planning new shipments, coordinate shipping, styling photoshoot, launching new products, handling social media, answering to many customer enquiries, processing orders, etc... and my little girl has been seeking lots attention from me. She initially could play by herself but after months of #stayhome, I guess she is starting to feel bored that she wants company. I feel really bad that I had been pushing her away by kept saying “just give mama a while more” (many times a day) but I would also feel extremely lousy if I didn’t fulfil my work duties well. 24 hours a day is way insufficient. I’m definitely sleeping lesser hours during this stayhome period. When’s time for vacation 🥱 (continue dreaming about that 💭)

Long weekend is approaching, hang in there 💪🏻
