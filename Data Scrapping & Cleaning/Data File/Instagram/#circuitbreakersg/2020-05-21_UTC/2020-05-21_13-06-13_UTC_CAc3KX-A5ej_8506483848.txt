I love Rick Riordon's Greek mythology series and after hearing @gandalfandunicorns raving about this Norse mythology series for a while, I knew I'd have to give it a chance.
Thank you @bookxcess for making this possible! I was hoping to visit the new store opened in Johor Bahru (Malaysia) but you-know-what happened. Thankfully the online store delivers internationally and if you're ordering to Singapore, there's a flat shipping fee of RM50. You can find books at 50%-80% discount throughout the year and I'm not complaining about the exchange rate difference either ðŸ™ˆ.
The delivery was prompt and the books came in great condition so I'm super happy ðŸ˜Š.
P.S. Featuring my Hades funko pop to show my love for Greek myth ðŸ™ˆ -
