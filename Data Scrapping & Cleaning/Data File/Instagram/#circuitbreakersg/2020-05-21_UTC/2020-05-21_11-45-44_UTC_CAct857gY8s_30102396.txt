We really missed the Risotto that we had in Italy during our trip in Jun last year . 
So tonight I decided to spend 1 hr standing in front of the stove to cook my 
Risotto with Shrimp and Mushrooms from scratch! 
Yes ...indeed quite a success and my family loved it ðŸ’•
Ingredients: 
Shrimps and mushrooms 
Methods : - Stock base :  Pan fried prawns head, prawns shells,  ginger, mushrooms stem, onion for 5 to 10 min then add water to boil for 30 min - Cook the risotto with the stocks - Add sea salt and pepper to taste - Heat up another pan to pan fried the prawns and set aside - stir fried the chopped mushrooms with shallot,  add dash sea salt and pepper - once risotto is about 80% cook , add the mushrooms and stir in . - I also added some herbs to it.
- top with the pan fried prawns and serve hot !
