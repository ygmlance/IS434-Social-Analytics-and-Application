While it's circuit breaker for us Singaporeans, it's lockdown for many living in other countries. Nonetheless, we are told to stay home for the greater good of everyone else until this tough time is through. For sure, all we wanna do is to walk the streets freely and meet our friends again! 
And here's my cover of 'GOTTA BE PATIENT' (performed by Michael Buble), a song written just for this COVID-19 pandemic! I bet we all feel the same way as the song lyrics but lets be patient and win this together!
