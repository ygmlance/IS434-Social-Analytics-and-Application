Found a stall selling Dang Gui Roast Duck through my sis-in-law. Love the fragrant and flavourful taste of Dang Gui on the juicy roast duck. They're found in a coffee shop which is not very common for Dang Gui roast duck and selling it at the same price as a regular roast duck. $38 for whole duck and $20 for half a duck. 😋😋😋⁣

Even their Char Siew was pretty amazing especially when they use pork belly for the roast. Nice caramelized layer wrapping fat juicy meat. Swipe across to take a look at the picture and you know what I mean. Yum!! 🤩⁣

The owner asked me if I want soup and when I said no, he pushed half a bowl of soup to me and said: "Try it!". Wa! Very power! Love the robust herbal flavours and best to have it hot. It's not free though, $1 for a container full. 😁👍🏻👍🏻⁣
