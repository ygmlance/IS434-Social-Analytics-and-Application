I’m in love with my playroom playtime. I have quite a few ‘spoilt’ paper, really heartbreaking when that happens. I have been looking at how I could play around with them a little more yet use them up quickly and effectively. If you all have more suggestions, please kindly let me know. I’ll totally appreciate any input.

Draw my day on bits and pieces of what I want to focus on.
