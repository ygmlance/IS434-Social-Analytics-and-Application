Time of the year to make Kerisik - the wonder ingredient for rendang ... sambil nonton drama trending @korbankasih._ di dapur 😁. It takes a while to toast the grated coconut over low flame .. bole dapat complete satu episode 😅.
Ok mine is the dry version non buttery kerisik and can be frozen up to a year ! Home made kerisik taste very different from the store bought ones which most of the time has the unpleasant smell that irks me 😑 Aside from rendangs and curries, kerisik may also be sprinkled on top of vegetable dishes and salads (kerabu) or added to the batter for fried bananas and plantains .No matter how it's used, kerisik adds irreplaceable body, flavor, and texture to a dish, making it worthwhile to prepare on your own.
