Dinner. #panseared #chicken and  #pasta with #caponata 
Chicken was #fromthefreezer and the caponata was mainly #pantrystaples other than the #eggplant 
I did a grocery run earlier in the week and bought this local #brinjal thinking I might do something Asian with it but no. Checked on it today and it was looking a bit sad and had to be cooked.
