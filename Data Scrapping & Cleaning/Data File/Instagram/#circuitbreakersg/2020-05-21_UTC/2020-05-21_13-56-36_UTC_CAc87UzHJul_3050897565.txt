Ansung Tangmyun
This is another one of the Korean instant noodles which is not available in regular sup√©rmarts. I ate it twice, first time with a beef patty and cheese and second time with oysters.
In Korea this noodle is supposed to have seasoning made from Ansung cows beef stock but I suspect this version is vegetarian if you look at the English words. Wish I could read Korean!
