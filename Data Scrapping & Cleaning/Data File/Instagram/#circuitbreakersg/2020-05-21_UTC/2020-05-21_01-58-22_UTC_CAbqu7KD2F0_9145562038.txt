[ That Chocolatey Day ]
Dear Diary, I finally managed to sneak a bite of those hoomans' cake after so many birthdays, they always don't gimme. This time, I jumped up to the table (swipe to see kangaroo in action) and bite a hearty mouthful of the CAKE! Ooooo it's chocolate flavoured! (I only had carob before tho) WAH it's yummy leh!

I had no idea why, but hoomama got angry at me. I thought I felt alright, but hoomama rushed me to the nearest vet that night and I had to go into the clinic alone cos of #circuitbreakersg. All the unfamiliar and extremely friendly faces, so scary sia. What do they want from me and where are my hoomans?

Then the vet put something on my eye that made me feel extremely uncomfortable, I vomitted out my dinner. It was so tiring and drowsy plus, it's past my bedtime already. After quite a while, they finally let me out and I went home with my hoomans.

I dozed in hoomama's arm while on the way home. The moment we are home, hoomama gave me a bowl of food topped with so much black stuffs! I have no idea what it was, looks really really scary. VERY VERY BLACK bowl. I approached it carefully, making sure it doesn't move or bite. After checking it out, I gulped down everything carefully, in case something will come out from those black stuffs. Well, it's not too bad I thought.

After that, I keep passing out black üí© and I feel ok now I guess. Hoomama say no more chocolate ever, but at least I ate it before? Teehee.

THE END
