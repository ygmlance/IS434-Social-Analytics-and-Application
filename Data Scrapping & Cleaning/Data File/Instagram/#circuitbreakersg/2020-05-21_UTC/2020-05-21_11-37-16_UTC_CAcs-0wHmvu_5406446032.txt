Pasta
500g “OO”(double O) flour
70g  Egg Yolks
150g  Whole Eggs
2-3Tbl Sp Water
Pinch  Salt

Optional
6pcs  Prawns, Halved 
100g  Cherry Tomatoes
20g  Chopped Garlic
2Tb Sp  Butter
To Taste  Salt
To Taste  Pepper

Main Steps:
1: In a mixing bowl or mixer, add flour, eggs, salt and mix to form a crumbly texture. Adjust with water to bind the dough, cling wrap at chill for about 1hr
2: Unwrap the cling flim and break down the dough to smaller pcs and work through a machine(electric or manual) starting with the largest gap to the smallest, dusting flour if needed
3: Fold the sheets into half and pass it through the machine again to form a more regular shape starting from the largest gap to smallest dusting flour if needed
4: cut sheets into about 30cm sheets, roll them and cut pasta to get noodle like pasta or if there is a pasta cutter roller, use it to cut desired pasta
5: Dust with more flour to prevent sticking, roll into balls of noddles and cover with cloth to prevent drying or sticking because of humidity. To store, cling flim and place in fridge for 2-3 days and freeze for longer periods

PS, the steps on rolling of dough can found on the earlier recipe  #homecooking #homerecipe #gaggenau #gaggenauofficial #wmf #wmfsg #circuitbreakersg
