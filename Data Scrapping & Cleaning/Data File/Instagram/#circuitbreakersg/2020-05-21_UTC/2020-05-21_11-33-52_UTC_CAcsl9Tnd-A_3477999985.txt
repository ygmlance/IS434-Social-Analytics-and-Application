Don't pay top dollar for bluff stones. 
Here is a jewelry insiders’ knowledge of gem quality. Whatmost people buy as commercial gems are "bluff stones." Onlyreal expert collectors can discern the Real "gem" (good)quality of a gem and amongst them is the sharedunderstanding that the top quality is very rare and high cost.
Perfection or even near perfection is a freak of nature - awonder of nature.
Imagine: There are 3 kinds of gems 1) Jyotish (good) Quality2) Doshi (bad) quality... and 3) Bluff quality. ---Bluff means astone or gem that looks, kind of, half way free of problems,most of which are hidden in the cutting and setting or eventreatment, as much as possible. These are essentiallydefective gems that are not in the category of good nor bad.
The trick is to buy the “bluff” (defective) gem at a cheap pricebecause it is common poor quality, then recut the gem andthen create a setting to hide the major or minor flaws...thislooks like “gem quality” (to the ignorant masses) and sells fornearly high prices, or even discounted higher prices, so thebiggest profit margin is in bluff gem jewelry. And that includes "cultured" as a BLUFF "pearl"
So, bad is bad, and bluff is bluff, but “gem” quality, such as"natural" pearl, high quality emerald, etc., is the most rareand most expensive. Such top quality gems allow only a verysmall profit margin because starting costs are so extremelyhigh (compared to common cheap bluff stones) that they cannot be marked up high like ordinary bluff stone jewelry.
In other words, good stones cost high and also sell high, badstones cost low and also sell low. But, BLUFF STONES COSTLOW YET SELL HIGH. Bluff stone cost the cheap price of bad
stones but sell for the high price of good stones. And this isthe bluff.
