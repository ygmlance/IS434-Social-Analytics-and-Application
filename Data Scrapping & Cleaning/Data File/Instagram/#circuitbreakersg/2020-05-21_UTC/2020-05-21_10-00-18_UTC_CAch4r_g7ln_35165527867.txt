Rose Basque Cheesecake and Matcha Basque Cheesecake from @thewhiskingwellsg 😋

First time trying Basque Cheesecake! it’s delicious!! can taste the burnt taste...it tastes a bit like caramel.

For Rose one, it’s a WOW 🤩 it’s beyond my expectation! It goes sooooo well with burnt cheesecake taste ~ the sweet and sour, and the rose scent~ I never actually like any rose dessert BUT THIS ONE IS GOOD! ❤️
...on the contrary... The matcha one 🤔, for my opinion, eating the burnt cheesecake separately from its matcha base tastes better... the matcha tastes strong though; bitter as it is, very yummy, I quite like it. Not sure why didn’t go well tgt, maybe because the matcha base isn’t sweet? hmm 🤔🧐 another post following this for the vid of me digging themmm 😋
