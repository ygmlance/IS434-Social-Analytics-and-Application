Guess what? Unfortunately nail salons have not been included in the phase 1 easing of the circuit breaker that begins on 2nd June. As you may expect, we are rather bummed by this news, but we trust the government has everyone's best interest at heart. We shall continue to miss you all and hope we get the green light to reopen in phase 2 whenever that might be. Stay tuned for updates and continue to stay safe.⠀
