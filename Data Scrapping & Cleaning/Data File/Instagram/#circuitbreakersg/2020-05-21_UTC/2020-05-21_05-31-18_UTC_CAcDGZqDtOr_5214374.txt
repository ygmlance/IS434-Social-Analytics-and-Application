Circuit Breaker Day 45
Migraine attacked since yesterday. So today's craft will just watercolour practices.
Bookshops have their charms. Old bookshops have even more charm. My wish... to visit old rustic bookshops in England. (But... I know it will be almost impossible, not due to the Covid-19. It is more of the fear of being in the air for more than 16 hours.)
