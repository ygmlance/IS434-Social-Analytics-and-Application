Checking off my lockdown cooking photo. ✔️ Actually, not really. 😅 This is what I’ve been cooking for @paulgohrj every weekend pre-corona. A simple recipe copied and paste from my MIL. This time cooked with @kuhlbarra barramundi — I’ve shared the ‘recipe’ via IGS pinned in MAY UNBOX II highlights, with a promo code! 🍲 
If there’s anything I’ve come to realise via this #circuitbreakersg, I’ve no natural passion for cooking. 🤭 The ability to cook is not genetic either. 😂 My mum is a pretty amazing cook and she always told me that she only learnt how to cook after getting married and having kids. 
Erm, we’re here now and it’s not happening. Haha. 💁🏻‍♀️👻 #circuitbreaker #stayhome #kuhlbarra #healthyeating #circuitbreakermeals #sgfood #ohhappyfry #grabease #liloikanbilis #babyfood #babyfoodideas #babyfoodrecipes
