Sensory Play #6 ‚Å£
Three-In-One ‚Å£
‚Å£
One thing about messy play is.. well, the cleaning up ü§£. This morning, I decided to try consecutive sensory activities to maximize the fun time before mummy has to get to work again. ‚Å£
‚Å£
We did a cornstarch dough that felt a lot like oobleck - cornstarch + water + dish soap. Michaela had a lovely time with the glitter, and it‚Äôs thrilling to hear her pronounce her first colour word ‚ÄòPurple‚Äô! ‚Å£
‚Å£
When it got too messy for her, she went on to the next activity - scooping colored ice (I recycled the squashed up water beads and froze them in little molds, thanks to a suggestion from @tickleyoursenses ) into little pails. That did a nice job too of washing off the cornstarch. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Finally it‚Äôs time to clean up! She decided to indulge in some impromptu water play. I‚Äôm always amazed at how something simple like scooping water can be so delightful for little ones. That‚Äôs what I love about toddlers. It‚Äôs refreshing seeing the world through their eyes ‚ù§Ô∏è. ‚Å£
