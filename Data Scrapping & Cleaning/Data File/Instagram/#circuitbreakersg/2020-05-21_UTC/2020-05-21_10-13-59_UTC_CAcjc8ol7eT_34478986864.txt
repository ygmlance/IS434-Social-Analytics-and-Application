Tonight was Asian (well #singaporeanðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ ðŸ¥³) night again, as we will be having beef wellington tmr. I decided to try the delivery from @makansutrasingapore (#gluttonsbythebay), since they allow you to order from multiple stalls, and of course I was craving multiple cuisines!

We got pretty much one dish from every stall â€” my top favorites #muttonmurtabak and #hokkienmee, as well as sambal stingray, butter chicken with naan, BBQ chicken wings and lime juice (not shown). Unfortunately we didn't get to order the satay as it wasn't ready at our specific time slot â€” that depends on location so we couldn't choose the timing. Everything was of course tasty except for the lime juice which tasted more like limeade ðŸ˜…. I am sooo full now I cannot move, and we still have leftovers.

To order, you can whatsapp the number on their Facebook/Insta page. They only deliver Thurs to Sun, and as I mentioned, the timing might depend on your location.They also do takeout.
