The Gil Evans Orchestra - Out Of The Cool, 1960. This isn’t an ordinary jazz album. This is Gil Evans at his towering best, at the piano, arranging and conducting. This is Gil having worked with Miles on a few projects and doing his own. #outofthecool was 1 of the first 4 albums released on Impulse! Creed Taylor wanted the album to advertise the new jazz label so no expense was spared on its production. The music on this album is so cool (groovy, baby!) and audiophiles will love it’s production and sonics.  #gilevansorchestra #raycrawford #roncarter #elvinjones #johnnycoles #impulserecords
