Something that has emerged from this #circuitbreakersg is this habit we have developed â€” Taking a Walk After Dinner!
More research has found that walking helps speed up the time it takes food to move from the stomach into the small intestines. This could help improve satiety after eating. In fact, the researchers found that these short post-meal walks were even more effective at lowering blood sugar after dinner than a single 45-minute walk taken at mid-morning or late in the afternoon.ðŸ˜± #walk #walking #afterdinnerwalk #postdinnerwalk #stroll #strolling #walkingwithmybae
