12 days to "Safe Re-Opening".
.
A little throw back to 8 years ago when I first joined the real estate industry, my first sales transaction was an HDB from this cluster.

Over the years, my partner, @hon23property and I upgraded ourselves and successfully transacted almost every type of properties including an entire floor of Suntec City office, conservation shophouses, bungalows, etc. In 2019, we ran Expressions of Interest campaigns for investment grade properties.

Our primary focus is residential landed properties sales. Viewings are still possible virtually albeit it takes time for more people to adapt to this new way of buying.

If you are looking for a landed home, do contact me :) Chai
