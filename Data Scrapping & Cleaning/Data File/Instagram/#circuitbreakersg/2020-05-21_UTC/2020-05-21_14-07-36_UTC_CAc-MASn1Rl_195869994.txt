[20.20 May 21: Circuit Breaker Day 45] First and the last trial, super unprepared. No vinegar and garnish but tasted not too bad as my the littlest ate it up, one of her favourite dish to order from Bak Kut Teh stores.

Was asking around how to clean the large intestines. Thanks @ilovedefamily, Yean Ming and Jason for the cleaning tips. I combined all their three methods just to make very sure the smell would be completely rid off.

Wash inside out, remove the yellowish, sandy substance (yes, those are poop), trim the fats. Rub down and wash in a bowl of water several times until it's not slimy anymore (both inside out)

Next, I rubbed with baking soda and salt. Soaked the intestines in vinegar for 30mins. Wash thoroughly before putting it into my pack of remaining marinade and fridge it over night.

I use pressure cooker over the stove for braising. Cook some mee suah in chicken stock and mix in some gravy to taste.

Conclusion, too much work and I can't stand the smell, ok I rather pay! üòÇ  #SerenesCookbook2020 #Stayhomecookingideas
