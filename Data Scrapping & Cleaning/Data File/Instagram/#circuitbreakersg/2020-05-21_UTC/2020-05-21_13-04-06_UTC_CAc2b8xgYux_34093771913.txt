The ones who love Disney needed to do at least one Disney cover in their lifetime. This song was created more than a year ago, finally, itâ€™s out! There were so many plans for it but with the Circuit Breaker we eventually did it this way. 
We snuck in ONE MORE SONG at the end, can you tell what song it is? Let us know if you like this mash up, and if youâ€™d like us to do more in the future!
.
Thanks to our friend @guitaristchen for the instrumental. His talent is off the charts ðŸ“ˆ Go check him out! .
Rach: Excited to be putting songs from 3 different films tgt! .

Nik: Iâ€™ve been obsessed with the song Sunflower since it came out. Iâ€™m still obsessed with it.
