If not for the price, this would third on the list of my favorite potato chips and a worthy substitute for Ruffles Cheddar Cheese and Cheetos Jalapeno. The tangy flavor of this is calibrated just right and the deep ridges add to the crunch. .
That said, this is made in Taiwan so the flavouring tends towards the artificial powder feel that I don't really like. At least with cheddar cheese, I could pretend I was eating something real but with this, you know it's artificial and highly unhealthy. The salt also makes itself markedly aware so after a while and lots of water later, I am forced to stop.
