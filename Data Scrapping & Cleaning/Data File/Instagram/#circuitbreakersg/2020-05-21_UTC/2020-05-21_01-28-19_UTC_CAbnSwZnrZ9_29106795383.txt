@doctorstitchsg we perform simple procedures to help our patients get better. Sometimes though, we need a bit of extra help from medications such as antibiotics üíä.‚Å£

Mr E had been having some pain in one of his fingers and it was particularly bothersome, especially when there was accidental contact (eg while riding a bike, typing on the keyboard etc). ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
We were contacted for an opinion and assessed it to be an early case of finger paronychia (ie infection of the side). This was partly contributed by cutting of his fingernails incorrectly. A minor procedure was performed (illustrative images from American Family Physician)‚Å£ to help relieve the offending part of the nail. Mr E still had pain over the next few days however, and subsequently had some pus discharge from the finger. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
A quick teleconsultation with pictures confirmed our suspicion. We prescribed and delivered a short course of antibiotics to him and the problem has now been resolved.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Again, we would like everyone to be careful while cutting your nails, as silly as it may sound!‚Å£‚Å£
