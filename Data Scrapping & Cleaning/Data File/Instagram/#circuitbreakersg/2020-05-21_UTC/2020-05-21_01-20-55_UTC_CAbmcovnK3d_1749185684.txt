Triceps Dips

#7dayarmchallenge #7dayarmschallenge with #blogilates 
Today included another workout for the Arms Challenge which is the Beautiful Arm Sculpt and my form is just blah. Triceps are the weakest, so it's so punished today! Body feels so tired. I need more sleep but work started again, decluttering still WIP but almost done. I really hope to get this finished so the room and the house looks neater. 
This food with the additional stress, snacking has started... Argh.. But I'll work harder on the workout too.. Tried to do Les Mills Body Combat #4 today as well as an add on to the challenge. Didn't do Heather's workout cos no stability ball.. #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
