I have been a long time fan of @kingarthurflour and @bobsredmill for their high quality products and their ethical philiospphy. This covid19 situation has given my sourdough bread journey a new challenge - a constant “Out of Stock” with flour I’m comfortable working with. 
Alternatives are whatever flour I could get my hands on that does not compromise on the quality. It’s both challenging and interesting getting to know new flour, how much water it prefers, how fast it would reacts to the environment temperature. It’s a constant “getting to know you” trial and error ... swinging between under proofed and over proofed, hoping to find the perfect balance in order for me to relax a little. 
Decided to test a loaf out today with @tomiz_by_tomizawashouten flour... a high protein bread flour ... I have a feeling it’s slightly on the over proofed end. Will know more after I cut it.
