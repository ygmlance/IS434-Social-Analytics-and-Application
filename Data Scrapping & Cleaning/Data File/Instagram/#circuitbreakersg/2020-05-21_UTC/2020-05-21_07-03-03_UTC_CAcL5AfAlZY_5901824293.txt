Here is where I say “Pardon my French”
Enveloppé [ahn-vuh-law-pay] means “enveloped”- extend leg outward then fold in 
Développé [day-vuh-law-pay] means “developed” - draw foot up then unfold and extend outward
These are reversed movement of each other and trust me - the movement is just as sophisticated (but much less complex) as the French pronunciation!
