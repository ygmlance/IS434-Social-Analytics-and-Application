My happy face after just finishing another at-home/virtual client workout! So proud that all my ladies are keeping up their strength and fitness during this time 💪⚡️ Aside from the physical benefits, they always tell me that they feel so much better mentally for spending time doing something for themselves (I’m looking at you, mums torn in ten different directions!).

In the words of Elle Woods “exercise gives you endorphins, and endorphins make your happy. And happy people don’t shoot their husbands”. Which is probably more important now than ever before😂
