🏠🎶Stay at home with music🎵🎹

Here is another music activity at home together with your little ones: Playing a new instruments!

Here I'm holding a small 15 strings harp, made beautifully in wood from @artists_music_studio. It is very light with weight only 1,5 kg and its easy to handle.

The range of this harp is 2 octaves starting from C2 - C4, which make this instruments easy to learn by anybody. It is great for simple improvisation, and easy for children to explore simple tunes. It is approachable for kid as young as 2 years old as the size is just perfect for them. The sounds of the strings are attractively beautiful & natural compare to any other toys instruments.

The packaging comes with a harp case, a strap to secure the instrument to your own body & a tuning wrench. Most importantly, the price are surprisingly reasonable!

Its a perfect instrument to have at home, especially during this #circuitbreaker period. Not mention the elegant design of the instrument will uplift the your whole living atmosphere by just sitting at the living room.

PM us for more details, or visit @artists_music_studio directly to find out more about the instrument.😉👍🏻
