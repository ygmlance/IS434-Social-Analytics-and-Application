I have resorted to taking 'IG-worthy' pictures outside my house (in my slacks), hoping that my lemon door curtain is enough as backdrop. But when the little person decided to photobomb my picture, boy was I glad! Hope this plain picture has some 'IG-worthiness' now! Hah!

I was heading out to @phoonhuat Hougang where I had to wait almost 90mins just to get in! A pity many items were sold out!
I chiong-ed to borrow Vanilla Powder from my dasao because Vanilla essence sold out everwhere. I think with the missing alcohol content from the essence, the cake's flavour not 100%. Experience bakers is this true ah?

Swipe left to see the butter cake I made for my ahma! Few days ago I suddenly had the 'feel' to make a butter cake even though Im not a fan of baking. Then ahma told me shortly after she found an old receipe of a butter cake and asked for me to make it for her! Telepathy or what!

Feat. @cloversoft hand sanitizer perpetually stationed at my gate!
