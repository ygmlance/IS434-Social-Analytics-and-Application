Struggling to “stay positive”? We know the feeling. In times when you can’t get past the doom and gloom, and no matter what you do can help your feeling low, it can be good to divert the attention from yourself and do a random act of kindness for someone else instead. Leave an envelope with a little gift for the delivery person who drops of your supplies outside your door. Your kindness doesn’t require a monetary outlay. Write a Facebook review for a friend who had a business. Comment on a colleague’s LinkedIn post. Send a snail-mail note of appreciation to a friend or colleague. Thank the custodians in your building for their efforts to keep things safe. Think of those who could benefit from your thoughtfulness and generosity. Then act. #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #meantalhealthawarenessmonth #circuitbreakersg #randomactofkindness #dogoodfeelgood
