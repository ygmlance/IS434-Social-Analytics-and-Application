I think I’ve got to win the medal for sleeping! So tired. The weather has been very sleep conducive. Being lazy shouldn’t be an excuse. So I managed to get off my butt and baked a Basque Burnt Cheesecake at the request of my daughter since she came back home a month ago! Fresh cream has been out of stock at supermarket for the longest time until yesterday! Finally. So here’s the Basque Burnt Cheesecake for my thousand gold girl.
