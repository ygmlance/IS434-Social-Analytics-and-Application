You can watch my IGS for the steps on making the meatballs spicy marinara sauce. You can get the recipe at this tag #honeybeecooksmeatballsmarinarapasta 
Cheesy toasts made with Soy and Linseed sourdough bread from @bakerandcooksg . I spread the bread slices with @thelaughingcowusa herb cream cheese wedges and cheddar slices. Butter toast them on the pan till all golden. 
The toasty sandwiches were perfect with the spicy marinara and meatballs. Yummy 😋 #cheesytoast 
Glad this last minute lunch turned out good! #circuitbreakersg day30 #stayhome #stayhomssingapore #sgunited
