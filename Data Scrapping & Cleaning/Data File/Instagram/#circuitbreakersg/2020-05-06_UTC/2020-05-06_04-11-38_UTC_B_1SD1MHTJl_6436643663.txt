“When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor” - Elon Musk

The circuit breaker has allowed me to read more and I’ve been absolutely inspired by Elon Musk, who epitomizes his quote above. He is certainly volatile and eccentric, as most geniuses are. But his vision to see possibilities way ahead of the world is quite unparalleled. Think private space travel and electric cars 20 years ago. The wicked secret ingredient is his perseverance and determination to see impossible things through, even if they were hanging by a thread. 
Pursue your dreams! Maybe a Tesla next 🤔? #elonmusk #tesla #circuitbreakersg #inspired
