😲 Life with kids feels like a walk in the zoo. Before, I was the food; now, they reject the food we offer them #hitsandmisses 👦🏻👧🏻 Am I the only one feeling this way?!

Vera and Leroy have been taking @usc_strongkids StrongImmune™ Kids and they’re down to the last few tablets now! I've tried them, and these animal 🦁 🐘 🐅 tablets taste fruity & not overly sweet!

To me, their health is always a priority & protecting them is my responsibility. Which is why supplements have been a part of their diet over the years. Now, it's even more important to be diligent in boosting their immunity during this #covid19 season 🙏🏻

Did you know that 70% of our immune system is in the gut? I've shared before about these scientifically tested supplements which boost 3 billion live probiotic cells. A healthy gut absorbs nutrients better - the 17 vitamins & minerals in each cute animal tablet help protect kids against infections, support healthy development of their organs and regulate immune response. More importantly, I like that Vitamin D3, Vitamin C and Iron are in it - the lack of sun exposure is 1 of my concerns as that may affect their bones, skin and eye health. Iron gets absorbed better with Vitamin C - they need this due to their low iron levels.
