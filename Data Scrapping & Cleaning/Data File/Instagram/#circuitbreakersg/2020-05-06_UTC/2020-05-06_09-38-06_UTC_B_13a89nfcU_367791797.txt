What a sweet surprise to receive flowers from Athena’s boss! Thank you and really appreciated! 😊😌 It has helped especially with WFH in the current situation due to #covid19 and experienced an emotional past weekend 😌. Grateful that was over with great outcome. Cheering high up again with several positive responses received yesterday and today. ❤️❤️❤️ #grateful #gratitude #circuitbreakersg #workfromhome #stayingathome #mothersdayflowers #giftingflowers
