To say that the last few days have been busy, would be an understatement... .

600 nutrition balls have been mixed, hand-balled, packed and delivered to one of the migrant workers dorms here in Singapore. .

All kinds of emotions ran through my heart when I saw photos of those gentlemen enjoying the treats. One thing’s for sure, my heart skipped a beat in the most beautiful way. Just to share a little ray of sunshine in such challenging times makes it all worthwhile… .

I’m extremely thankful and grateful to my dear husband and my darling mother who, without a slight hesitation, made this mission possible. There is no way I would have been able to do it all by myself. It was also a very special bonding time for our family 🤍 .

Thank you very much @itsrainingraincoats for all your incredible work that you do to help and support migrant workers in Singapore and for giving us the opportunity to contribute. We will forever be grateful. .

I certainly hope that this initiative was just a run-up to many more impact-driven projects for GLAZE… .

Stay safe, stay mindful and stay grateful 🤍 .
