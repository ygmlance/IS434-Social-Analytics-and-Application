What is Japanese Rice? Rice (米, kome) is Japan's most important crop and has been cultivated across the country for over 2,000 years. While a bowl of cooked rice is a central part of traditional Japanese meals, the grain is also processed into several different types of products including alcohol, vinegar and flour.

Through Sky Premium's member-exclusive eStore, we bring in quality Japanese rice from our curated partner. Discover the best of Japan with @skypremiumsg.
