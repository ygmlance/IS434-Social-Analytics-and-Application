Some afternoon 🍵 snacks that I made, Sweet Potato Balls and Pan Fried Sweet Potato Cake!

Used Purple Sweet Potatoes for the cake and.. it wasn’t sweet enough.. other than that it was okay 👌🏻 heh. The Potato balls were.. disappointing.. HAHA. Shall try it again when I have the orange potatoes 🍊 hehe.

I’m really excited and happy that we’ll be able to resume operations on the 12th hehe! We are taking in pre orders, our first batch of bakes will be on 12th May, so please place your orders if you wanna be one of the first 🤚🏼🙌🏻
