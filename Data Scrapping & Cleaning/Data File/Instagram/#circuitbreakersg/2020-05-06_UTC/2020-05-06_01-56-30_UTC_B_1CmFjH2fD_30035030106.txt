steaks last night! Got a couple of ribeyes from @redmartcom, so decided to do a taste test. One of the cuts was a 300g NZ for $12, and was surprisingly flavourful! Whipped up a little corn with bacon, baked cauliflower cheese, and baked potatoes for sides. And of course, paired with a lovely red. #steaks #NZbeeef #ribeyesteak #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakersingapore #stayhome
