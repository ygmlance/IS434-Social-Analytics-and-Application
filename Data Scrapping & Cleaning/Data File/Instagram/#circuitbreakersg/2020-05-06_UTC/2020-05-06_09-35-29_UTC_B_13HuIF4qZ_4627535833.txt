Prepared a feast during labour day for the family. I decided to switch it up after having the same foods over the entire course of the April CB period. ðŸ˜‹ Some homemade items include:
.
> Beer battered fish & chips
> Homemade BBQ sauce ribs
> Homemade tartare sauce
> Smashed garlic butter spread

Never got to take a picture for the individual items because everyone was starving. But we wish for an amazing month of May for everyone!
