#Circuitbreakersg day 30

It isn’t so hard after all.  30 days have passed. “gasps”

Decided to do this quick & simple 2 Ingredients (self rising flour & Greek yoghurt) flatbread for lunch. I love these flatbread as it’s yummy, versatile & can freeze it for future consumption.

Lunch today was : 🔺 Freshly pan-fried yoghurt flatbread with tuna mayo & lotsa veggies. ~
