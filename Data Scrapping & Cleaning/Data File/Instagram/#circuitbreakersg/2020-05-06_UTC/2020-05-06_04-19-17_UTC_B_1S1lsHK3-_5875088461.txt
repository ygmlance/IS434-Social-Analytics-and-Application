The struggle is real.

If your house is messy because of your children, you are not alone. 
I got pissed off with my son for giving me all the mess.

I decided to put put my foot down to teach him 2 important lessons in life.
Rewards or Consequences.
And these? Taught him to pick up his own toys and start clearing the house! .

Are you struggling like how I used to be? 
Or you know of someone who’s house could use some help from this video? .

Haha.. share it! So that we can all help ourselves amongst this community!
