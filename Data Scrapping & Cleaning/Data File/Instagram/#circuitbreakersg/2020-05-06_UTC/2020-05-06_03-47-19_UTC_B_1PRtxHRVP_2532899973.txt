Situation butt ass. Slide, slide, slide. Am on a slaying mode now coz found mealies. Spotted the mulberry and my fav syngonium yellowing. Lifted one of the leaves and them white hairy buggers. RAGE RAGE RAGE MODE on top of the sucky mood I was in. Couldnâ€™t save one of the mulberry. Anyway, itâ€™s almost botak coz cat-terpillar Felix ate them without me knowing. This despite the fact I placed it beside my Aloe Beast. Yes yes I know the danger. Never under or overestimate a cats intellect. Heâ€™s a genius I know ðŸ˜¹ .

Have salvaged what I can and am now re-rooting (is that even a term)the syngonium after I squished every one of the mealies. Sorry Iâ€™m evil. You hurt my love ones, you dead. Now, I wanna get plants coz the balcony is a little bare. Got gaps. Can see the gaps? Must fill them up you know?? Hmmm now how do I justify my purchase? Hmm ok - â€˜You say I waste money buy flowers so I buy plants Lor? See! Never die!â€™ Dear plant IG friends. Do note that I will go buy your plants soon ðŸ˜‚
