Rules for Perfect Murders: 
the book doesn't read like a normal murder/thriller mystery, and for good reason. The premise of an FBI agent pairing with a bookstore owner may also seem cliché but it doesn't even touch on that. The entire novel is a treatise of what it means to love murder mysteries and the classics, and pays homage to some of the greatest ones.
