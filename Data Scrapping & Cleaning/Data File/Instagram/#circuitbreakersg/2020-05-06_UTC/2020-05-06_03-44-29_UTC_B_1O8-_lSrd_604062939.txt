Tofu Carrot Ball & Honey Glazed Cauliflower Seaweed with Basil Pesto sauce. â€¢
No-Meat-Menu requested by the husband. Although we arenâ€™t a vegan, we feels that it good to have some veggies meals only. Husband said this menu is one of my best dish invention to date. He said because the texture is like feta cheese. I was flattered however considering that his taste preference is very different from normal people, that might have mean quite the opposite for others ðŸ˜†
