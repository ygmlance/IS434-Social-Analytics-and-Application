Miss the #tarjarin and #vealmilanese from @casatartufo so had to order it for takeaway. The food travels well! Tasted almost as good eating at home. Also an excuse to open a 1997 bottle of #sandronelevigne #barolo, which was quite spectacular: a 23 year old wine which tasted as young as a 3 year old, with firm tannins still and a long concentrated finish. Could cellar for another 10 years I reckon. #sandronelevigne1997 #piedmontwine #italianwine #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
