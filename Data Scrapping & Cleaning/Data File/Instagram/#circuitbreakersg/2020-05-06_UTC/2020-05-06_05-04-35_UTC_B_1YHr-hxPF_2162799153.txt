We would like to thank each & everyone of you for the overwhelming response for our Festive Cookies ❤️⠀
⠀
Orders will be ready for delivery or collection tentatively between 𝟏𝟔 𝐭𝐨 𝟏𝟖 𝐌𝐚𝐲 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟎.⠀
⠀
With the current Covid-19 situation, we strongly advice you to 𝐨𝐩𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 whenever possible. Otherwise, for 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟-𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, you will be given an 𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐥𝐨𝐭 for contactless collection. ⠀
⠀
As always, #stayhome & stay safe during this period. And we hope our cookies will keep you company too! 😊⠀
