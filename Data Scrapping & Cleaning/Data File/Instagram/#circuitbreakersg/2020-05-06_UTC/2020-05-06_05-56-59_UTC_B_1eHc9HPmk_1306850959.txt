🎡The possibilities of happiness are all around us, if we would only open our eyes and give thanks. 🎡 Having /practicing gratitude is such an important virtue. It’s only when you practice gratitude, you will be more appreciative of what you have; and you will be able to find positivity in failures and continue to stay hopeful. Let’s all practice gratitude especially during this CB period. Today, I have a very nice and warm breakfast! Hot Campbell canned chicken soup paired with garlic biscuits from Bangkok, blueberries and earl grey chiffon cake which I baked last night. I added a bit of maple syrup to counter the bitter aftertaste of the cake. 😋😋😋 Special mention to the Hello Kitty bowl- I won that in a lottery in 7-11 during a Tokyo trip. 🥰Also, I had a nice cup of Starbucks 3-in-1 vanilla latte. Feeling calm and satisfied. 😌 oh, my flowers have wilted so it’s time to buy new flowers from cold storage soon! 😍
