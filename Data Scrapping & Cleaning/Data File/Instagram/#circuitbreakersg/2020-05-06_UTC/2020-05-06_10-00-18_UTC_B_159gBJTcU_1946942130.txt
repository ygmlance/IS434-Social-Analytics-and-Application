We love a good rice cooker recipe as much as anyone. If you’re sick of washing a pile of dishes after every cooking adventure, this creamy and umami-filled Mentaiko Mac and Cheese can be whipped up entirely in a single pot. Begin by sautéing finely minced onions and shallots in a rice cooker, then pour in whole milk and your favourite pasta. Add shredded cheese into the pot, before stirring in mentaiko pasta sauce, as well as tobiko roe if you have it. Enjoy while it is still gooey and piping hot!
