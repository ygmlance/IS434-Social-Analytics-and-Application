Day 30 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (6 May 2020) - I can hardly believe it's been 30 days since I've embarked on a daily pictorial record of making lunch and dinner for just 1 person (mostly simple dishes and many comprising #leftovers), making every meal a different dish or a variation using similar ingredients. Bar 2 KFC deliveries and 2 take-outs when I had no time to cook, it has been  a qualified success. It has also given me the chance to share recipes and experiences; and many friends have started or resumed their own culinary adventures and sharing their kitchen tales! Most importantly, it's given me the chance to walk a month in my late mum's shoes and try to understand what it must have been like to be both a housewife raising 3 children and working at the same time. I am quite frankly exhausted after just 1 month, with burns, cuts, aches and bruises from cooking and cleaning; and other than making occasional delivery packages for family or friends, I have only been taking care of ONE person! If you have a #mum who has been taking care of you and making #homecooked meals for you, like mine did, please let her know that #mumsarethebest and that you appreciate and love her very much. Men who have #housewives , please imagine yourselves in their shoes if you can, at least some of the time; and show your appreciation. Today's #nofilter #dinner is #coffeeporkribs with a #bittergourdomelette using the #leftover #bittergourd from Day 16 #stayhomestaysafe everyone! #stayhomewithascott #homecooking
