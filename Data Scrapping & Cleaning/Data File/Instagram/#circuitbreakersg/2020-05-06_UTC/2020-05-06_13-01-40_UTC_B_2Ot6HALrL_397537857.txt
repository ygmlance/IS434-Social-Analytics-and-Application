#CircuitBreakerSG D-30
A change from our usual 3-dish Chinese dinner on the eve of Vesak Day. Gave myself a break and worked the oven out instead ðŸ˜Š

Herb roasted Chicken with vegetable medley consisting of Carrot, Potato, Sweet Potato, Pumpkin & Sweet Corn. Also having Mango Tomato Salsa, grilled Oyster Mushroom & Sandwich. We're so pleased that the chicken turned out so tender using the rotisserie oven, perfectly cooked retaining all the juice and flavour.

Enjoy your dinner too ðŸ˜‹
