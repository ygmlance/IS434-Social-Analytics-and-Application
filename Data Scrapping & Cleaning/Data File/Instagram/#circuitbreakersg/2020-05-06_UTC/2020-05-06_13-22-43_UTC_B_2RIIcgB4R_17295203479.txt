I’ve amassed a fair collection of teas due to hampers and sudden crazes where I purchase teas and forget to drink them.

I’m trying to clear what I have and make space and simplify. I am also trying to get better sleep. Ploughing into the camomile teas first and hoping it will push me in the right direction and also help me wind down after the full on days of having the boisterous kids home all day.

Have you kept up with hydration?
