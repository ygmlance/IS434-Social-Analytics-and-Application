Continued the CB Cookout with a long-awaited attempt at kimchi jjim! Made the kimchi from scratch two months ago and decided to let some pork belly sit pretty with it then. Well, fermented meat is much more tasty! This was jam packed with flavour and the broth was to die for! #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgeats #eatsg #igsg #circuitbreakercookingchallenge #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker
