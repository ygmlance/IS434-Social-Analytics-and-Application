I walked into @giantsingapore with intention of buying Nutella, fins sugar, chai poh (preserved raddish bits) only... then ... I rmbr @chen_rosalind wanted Taiwan cocktail sausage & gula malacca syrup on Mon which was oos at ShengSiong and this morning she says she wants chocolates.... after that I rmbr I finished up the bttl of sesame oil on Mon... then I add on top shell cos haven't eaten them for a very long time already & I added a pkt of tidbits ... in the end I didn't get chai poh cos its also oos & I didn't get fine sugar cos they dun have 1kg pack.. and that bottle of Nutella is the last bottle which I found it tug away at chocolates shelving! .
