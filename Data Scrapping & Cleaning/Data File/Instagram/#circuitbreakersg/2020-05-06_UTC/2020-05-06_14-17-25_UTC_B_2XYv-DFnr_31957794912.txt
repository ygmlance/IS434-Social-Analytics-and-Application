Realise I still have a piece of steak sitting in the freezer & decided on pan searing this baby for dinner. Baste it with some butter and thyme and top off with a sprinkle of sea salt. Love thyme for its lemony notes that really brings out the beefiness in steak. Cooked to perfection this time, the way I like it: medium rare. A good book & wine to pair along & settle in for the night, no better way to destress. Love cheap & good supermarket meats - got  this ribeye at a steal for less than 15 bucks & itâ€™s decent enough. Home cooked is always nice, that is if youâ€™ve the luxury of time to prepare. #alltomyselfðŸ˜‹ .
