Didnt knew that making Bubur Hitam at home is that simple until I saw @thesilverchef post.

Following his recipe, place 150g of Black Glutinous Rice (rinse it first), 5 cups of water into the rice cooker, set it to rice cooking mode and it's ready within 1 hour. Add some coconut sugar, coconut milk and its ready to serve.
