Sweltering under mid day heat and mask, figuring out how to buy postage
.
Sending mails at this time, you pay festive charges....hmmmm...
.
It has been sooooo long...the last mail sent could be half or a decade ago
.
Have forgotten how snail mails had served mankind for so long until technology usurped its throne
.
Who would have thought that snail mail will regain its usefulness today?
.
Keeping my fingers crossed that mails reach the kids before Sunday
