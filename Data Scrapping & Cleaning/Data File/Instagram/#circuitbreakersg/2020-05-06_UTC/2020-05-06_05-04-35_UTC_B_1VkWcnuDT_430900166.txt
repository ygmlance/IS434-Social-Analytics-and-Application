Mums, we respect you for your strength & resilience, and we’re grateful for the love you’ve given us, bringing us up all these years! Our fashion choices however.... that’s a different story!! 🤣😂😅Anybody can relate?! Anyway, Mother’s Day 2020 is gonna be a whole new ballgame because the Circuit Breaker is still upon us in Singapore, but that shouldn’t stop us from giving our mothers that something special for everything she’s done for us! This year, we thought we’d simply take the guesswork out of it & offer special B&M gift cards that you can purchase for your mums in anticipation of the lifting of the circuit breaker! To sweeten the deal, we’re offering 10% discount for $30 gift cards, 15% discount for $50 gift cards & 20% discount for $100 gift cards. (Limited to 5 gift cards per person) These gift cards are valid for a year so there’s plenty of time to decide on your shopping! If you’re interested to purchase these gift cards, do DM us for more details! Meanwhile, everyone stay home, stay safe & Happy Mother’s Day in advance! 🌹💝🌈😘
