Greetings! It's Wonderful Wednesday! Well, I'm always on the hunt for new food to try & even with CB, this won't stop me! This time it's @the1925jc! Not only do they serve food, they also have their craft beers!
.
One thing that intrigued me was that they serve their own take of Teochew cuisine & as a Teochew myself, I'm always game to try out food from my own dialect group! 🤩

So what's my favourite? Their Loh Ba Set. The meat was slightly on the drier side but the rice. The RICE is everything. It has pork lard fried into it & it's just so fragrant & so delicious. 🤤 The onsen egg was also perfect & I'll be satisfied to just have the rice & the onsen egg topped over it as a meal. I'm not really a rice person but demn, I couldn't put my spoon down when I was eating the rice. So gooood. 💕

Personally, the meats were abit on the drier side for me & if it was more juicy, I think it would be perfect! They have other rice sets as well such as:
.
▫️Ultimate Chargrilled Beef Set
▫️Chargrilled Beef Set
▫️Grilled Chicken Set

So, what have you been craving the most during the CB period? Besides, like BBT. Pretty sure most of SG runs on BBT. 🤣
