Upcycling is not that difficult. Just got to get creative, and it takes trial and errors and that’s ok! ⠀⠀
Most importantly, it’s the willingness to try. ⠀⠀
We got this bottle from @thesundaypunch last year and since then we’ve been making our own reed diffuser scents by sticking in reed diffusers from @scoopwholefoods_sg and concocting our own scents cocktails.
⠀⠀
Bartendering and scent mixing is not that different, it all about the emotions we want to arouse and feel within us.
⠀⠀
Here are some diffuser scents we love. - Lemon & Orange - Bergamot, Lemon & Cardamom - Frankincense & Lavender - Peppermint & Tangerine ⠀⠀ You  will need 20 drops of essential oil for each 1/4 cup (60ml) of fractionated coconut oil. Use a funnel to add 1 tablespoon alcohol, fractionated coconut oil, and essential oils to the bottle.
⠀⠀
Gently swirl to mix together, then add the reeds into the bottle. Let the diffuser sticks soak up the oil for one hour, then flip them over.
⠀⠀
Enjoy the aroma, you will occasionally need to flip the reeds to freshen the smell. You will need to replace the reed diffuser oil every 1-2 months if the scent fades, or the oil evaporates.
