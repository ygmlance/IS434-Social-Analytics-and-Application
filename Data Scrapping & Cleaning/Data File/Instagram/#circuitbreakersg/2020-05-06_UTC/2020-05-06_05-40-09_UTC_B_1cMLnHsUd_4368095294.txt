🌈CN Day30 - Lunch Time🌈
.
Eating Teochew Muay today! .
Wahahaha! I know too many dishes till cannot see my porridge again... ... I don't know, my cutesy mum 👩🏻‍🦱 decides on the dishes, my menu only write 3 Chinese characters "潮州粥" that's all.
.
It's always magical... ... 3 words earns tonnes of dishes... ... More powerful than "Errr..." 🤣😝 Oops! 🙊🙊🙊Sorry, pun-intended🤣just joking don't sue me!!! 🤐🤫🤭
