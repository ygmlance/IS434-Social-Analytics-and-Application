I am unsettled by how okay I am to scan my IC everywhere I go now.

I am unsettled by how comforted I am that I donâ€™t have to show my face nor my expression when I go out.

I am unsettled by how quiet I am these days offline, and so chatty online.

Imagine your body like a big bag of muddy water. When you stay still enough, all the mud and dirt and sediments will settle at the bottom.

Settle. Down.
