We have converted one of the bedrooms into a home office for hubs. Whenever he comes out for meals or breaks, he tries to spend about 10 minutes with the kids. But every single time without fail this happens when he goes in. The amount of crying has reduced though from the initial days where it would last a steady 15 minutes. Now it's about 2-5 minutes and she's found something else to do.

Does this happen at your place too? Do the kids get bugged when you/your partner go into your home office?
