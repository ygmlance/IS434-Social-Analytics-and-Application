Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 30:
Made another version of eggplant rolls using pork belly since I had an extra eggplant sitting in the fridge.

Instead of rolling the eggplant into the pork slices, I wrapped pork belly around the eggplant. Seems easier to handle as I twirl the pork belly slices around the eggplant like a candy cane pattern. Tried simmering the pork belly rolls in the sauce for a longer period and I love how it turned out tender, moist and flavorful.

Going to try other ingredients with pork rolls in future!
