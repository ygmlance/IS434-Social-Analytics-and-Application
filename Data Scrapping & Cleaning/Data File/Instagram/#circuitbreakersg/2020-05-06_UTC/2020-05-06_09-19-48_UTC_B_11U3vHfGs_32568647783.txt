Baby Seraphina's #circuitbreaker diary no.1
👶🏻👵🏼
Mummy says it is not possible to go to malls or children's playgrounds during the circuit breaker period. A short walk in our quiet neighbourhood with grandma is equally fun! I sing with the birds, I dance amongst the trees and I greet my favourite pinwheels outside our neighbour's house every day.
