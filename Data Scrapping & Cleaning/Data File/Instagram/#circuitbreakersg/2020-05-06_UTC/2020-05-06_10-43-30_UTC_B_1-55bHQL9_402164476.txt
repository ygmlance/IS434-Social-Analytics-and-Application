Whatâ€™s your favorite Last Dance moment so far?
.
.
Mine is: about Management trying to convince Jordan NOT to play w/ a 10% chance he could get permanently injured.
.
Reinsdorf: "I said to Michael, 'you're not thinking about the risk-reward ratio. If you had a terrible headache and I gave you a bottle of pills and nine of the pills would cure you and one of the pills would kill you, would you take a pill?".
.
Jordan: "It depends on how bad the headache is." #goat #thelastdance #mjmondays
