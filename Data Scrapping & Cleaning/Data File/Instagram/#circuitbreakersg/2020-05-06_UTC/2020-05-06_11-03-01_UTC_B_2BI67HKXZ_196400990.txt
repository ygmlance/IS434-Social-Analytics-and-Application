Dinner this evening, was a bowl of steamed rice, stir-fried Kai Lan, or Chinese Kale, and light Chicken Stew, which was made by sweating ginger slices, cube cut white onions, and minced garlic until fragrant, then adding the chicken (i used two whole legs), superior light soya sauce, Shaoxing wine, a dozen whole white peppercorns, and enough water to cover everything. Then i added one carrot and a potato cut in cubes, four dried shiitake mushrooms cut into quarters and let it simmer over low heat with the lid on for about a hour. Tasty and satisfying. ðŸ˜‹ #chickenstew #stirfriedkailan #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
