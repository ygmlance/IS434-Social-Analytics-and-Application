Book 13 of 2020 - I straight up loved this book so much that I took almost a week to savour it. It was such a compulsive read, and so completely unpredictable, and I was so happy to see the return of a certain character from Stephen King’s Bill Hodges trilogy. What an unexpected pleasure!  Again, this isn’t a classic horror story, but it did give me the creeps (I mean that in a good way) and really turned what I thought was just a simple murder mystery into so much more. #books #reading #fiction #stephenking #theoutsider #billhodgestrilogy #mystery #murdermystery  #novels #currentlyreading #fortheloveofreading #bookworm #booklover #bookish #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakerreads
