Day 30 of #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~
The husband suddenly feeling a bit of cabin fever so he went out  for a spot of supermarket shopping and dabaoing.
.
I must say I myself have been feeling a bit sick of cooking. It wouldn’t be so bad if I had the rest of the day to myself but of course I have to entertain @edward365. No joke to cook twice a day, plus all that washing up.
.
Anyway if you’ve been following me you’ll know my favourite eatery at East Point Mall is Lor Duck. Aside from their braised duck dishes which are a must try, I love their seafood crispy noodle. It packed well! I heated up the sauce and poured it all over my super crispy noodles. Totally hit the spot.
.
Edward had the braised duck rice all to himself! He even said wow the food looks good today. Hey, are you saying Mama’s cooking is no good?!?! The husband had the sweet and sour pork and that was good too.
