Amidst us being so busy today, I whipped up a quick all day breakfast for lunch for the both of us. 🥚🍳🍞🥓🧈🌱⁣

Decided to do the scrambled the American way, that’s why I got the gorgeous folds. Contrary to belief, you don’t always need cream or milk to make scrambled eggs. ⁣
⁣
Just a slab of really good butter, the right heat on the stove and a trusty spatula. Most importantly the know-how to time your eggs and know when to move it off the stove. That’s all you need! ⁣

Folds and sheen you way when you get ‘em scrambled right! 🎉⁣
⁣
A side of pork sausages, salmon with cream cheese, baby tomatoes and greens for great bells and whistles! Good to go baby! ⁣

Breakfast for champions! 🏆🏆🏆💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼⁣
