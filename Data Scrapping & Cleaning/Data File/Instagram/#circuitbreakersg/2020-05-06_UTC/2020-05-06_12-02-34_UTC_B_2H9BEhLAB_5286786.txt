As much as we're going crazy with the CB, the prolonged hours cooped with family members and the absence of the enigma of work-related matters, it has been probably the longest period where many get to have a good meal with loved ones.

All the lit windows definitely a better sight than gloomy and eerie shadows of buildings. Indeed a silver lining and a sliver of hope.
