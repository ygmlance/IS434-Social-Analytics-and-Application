Day 30 - #circuitbreakersg
Cloudy day....
🌥
Has been drawing more often nowadays and I don't get bored of it.... picking up my long lost hobby since childhood.
👩‍🎨
Its #zentangle time! 
Also a time for me to stay zen.
🙌
Hope u enjoy the video.. can't get it to stay in focus since I am holding the phone to film and drawing at the same time. 😅
