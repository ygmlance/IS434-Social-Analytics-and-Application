Binge-watching Kim’s Convenience got us missing Korean food 🇰🇷 during this circuit breaker period and decided to cook up some yummy Japchae & Kimchi pancake🤤
.
For Japchae, simply stir-fry some garlic, onion, shrooms and carrot till cooked, and stir in (pre-blanched) sweet potato noodles & baby spinach. Add in soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, pepper and pinch of sugar for seasoning 🍲 
For Kimchi pancake, we used pre-packed kimchi from the supermarket, mixed in some plain flour, corn starch, salt and water to form a paste and pan-fry it till golden brown 🥬
.
Being non-avid homecooks, we usually turn to online recipes as our base and mix things up slightly from there to suit our liking 🌶 (or try to use up whatever’s left in our fridge!)
