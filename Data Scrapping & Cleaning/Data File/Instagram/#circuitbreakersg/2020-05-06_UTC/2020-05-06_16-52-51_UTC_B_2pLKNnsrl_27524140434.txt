*PASTA PATTERN & COUNT THREADING MATH GAME*

My 29monthsold little boy’s love for numbers runs deep that he asks me for at least one number game a day through this #circuitbreakersg period 😅. I observed he is in yet another number/math sensitive period as he is chatting, playing, counting and asking countless questions on this topic throughout the day. Following his lead and conversations, I’ve set up many low-prep number plays for him to explore different #earlyyearsmaths concepts.

Here is a simple hands-on math game that Jasper enjoyed playing this week and it explores a couple of learning concepts:
✅ Exposure/Recognition of  Arabic numerals, mandarin numbers and numbers in words
✅ Reinforces one-to-one correspondence
✅Counting
✅ Introduces Pattern - via. follow the pattern, with a subtle exposure of ABAB pattern for number 4
✅ Fine-motor skills via. threading

Learning numbers in word form is 👦🏻‘s latest interest as he asked me how to make numerals with the alphabets over the weekend when we were playing with his foam letters and numbers. He was so happy when we formed a few together. So this element is a key feature in our number plays this week.

Simple pattern is another early math concept we are exploring - starting with copying the pattern before moving on to ABAB pattern when 👦🏻 is ready.

I’ve made the simple math number card by drawing with sharpie on paper - including elements of learning I wish to expose Jasper to. We reuse our DIY dyed pasta (made last year) used in our sensory plays for threading - one can easily substitute this with any threading toys/ fruit loop cereals. For threading, we used vertical threading with straw (long pasta/sticks works too) and playdough as base or try shoe-lace threading into a necklace (last picture). Have fun!

I’ll share a couple of our favourite math plays during this season in the next few posts - stay tuned.
