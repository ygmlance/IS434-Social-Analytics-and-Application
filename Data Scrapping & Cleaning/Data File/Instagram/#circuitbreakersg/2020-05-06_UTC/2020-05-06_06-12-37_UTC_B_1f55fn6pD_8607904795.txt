Good Wednesday to all!

So how old (or young) can a child start to have swim lessons? The answer will be - any age .😀 Every child develop uniquely so there is no real answer when will be a good time.

There are classes specially tailored for different ages - Baby class (0-3 years old), Toddler class (3-5 years old) and Learn To Swim class (above 5 years old and adults too). However, don't worry as we will assess and place the child in the correct program which will be best for the child's development. 🏊‍♂️🏊‍♀️ Swim Safe, Swim Happy.
