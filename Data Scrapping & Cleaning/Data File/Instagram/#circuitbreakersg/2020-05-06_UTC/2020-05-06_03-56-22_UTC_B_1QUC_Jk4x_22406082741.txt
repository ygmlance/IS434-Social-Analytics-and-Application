âœ¨#QuarantineWorkout Tipsâœ¨
-
Now is a great time to focus on getting better at something, or practicing something youâ€™re always wanted to be able to do or get stronger at.
-
âœ…You can do them daily.  Start with your hands elevated and make a goal of getting to the floor with perfect technique
âœ…Want to get stronger with push ups?  Add in some push up variations like 1.5 reps, or a 5 second lowering (<â€”that might kill you ðŸ˜‚. This one is super challenging)
âœ… See how many push ups you can do in a row by the end of quarantine
-
So find something you want to work on, or learn more about, and letâ€™s get to it!  We can all sit around and be miserable, or we can make use of this time to get stronger, and to get better at something.
