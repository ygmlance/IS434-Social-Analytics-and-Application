DIY beef satay using marinated meats & made some ketupat/rice cake (recipe below) to go with the peanut sauce that comes with every purchase of 1kg frozen marinated satay meat from Lau Pa Sat Best Satay Stall 7 & 8. (Swipe to 👀 video on how these are being prepared).

My family enjoyed these beef satay very much! My girl was initially skeptical when I placed order for beef instead of chicken cos in her mind beef satay meat is usually quite tough. How wrong she was when she tasted it as the beef satays are succulent and tasty!!! 😋👍😍
.

Now, it is being offered on Klook app with delivery as well as exclusive promotion of $22 for a kilogram of marinated satay meat (available in Chicken, Beef, & Mutton) and comes with a packet of 500g satay peanut sauce.

1. Wash & drain rice. Place rice and water in the inner pot of rice cooker. Select "rice setting" to cook.

2. After cooking is done, immediately transfer rice to a loaf pan lined with food grade cling wrap. Press down with rice paddle as you transfer. After finished transferring, cover the top surface with another piece of cling wrap. Use hand to compress down and smooth the surface.

3. Poke the cling wrap with a skewer to create holes for steam to escape. Let cool a little and put into fridge for an hour before cutting into 1 inch cube.
