🍚Day 30/56•StayHome Dinner 
I needed to clear the freezer so I ended up cooking both salmon & beef. I needed to clear off the remaining bittergourd & the bunch of garlic sprouts before they get too old. I didn't cook soup so I had to steam egg for the kids. That's how we ended up with 5 dishes! 😆😆😆 Good news was the Martians ate today's bittergourd egg! Haha! .
