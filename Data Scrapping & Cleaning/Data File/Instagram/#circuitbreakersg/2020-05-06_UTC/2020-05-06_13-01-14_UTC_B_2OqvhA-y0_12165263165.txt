Quarantine

What is the one place you miss during this lockdown period? For me, it's a quiet cafe where I can draw peacefully.

Fun fact: The word "Quarantine" comes from quarantena, which means 40 days, the number of days that sailors and ship passengers had to stay isolated before being allowed ashore during the Black Death epidemic in the 14th Century. OK, maybe not so fun fact... #quarantine #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #lockdown #stayhomestaysafe #covid19 #pandemic #fishtank #fishbowl #fish #goldfish #castle #comics #cartoons #comic #cartoon #funfact
