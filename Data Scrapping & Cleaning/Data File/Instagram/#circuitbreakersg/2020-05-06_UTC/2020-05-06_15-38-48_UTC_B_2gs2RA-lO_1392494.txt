Mr. Kiwek.

Happy birthday, @phatno.ez23 !

About 3 years ago, on my way to the toilet at Blackbook, you encouraged me to pick up the spray cans. Thanks for the push, there's no turning back now :) May we paint together again once this whole thing blows over.

Though I don't normally do portraits, thought it was a good time to play with a different finishing style.
