Made a Filipino feast today! üáµüá≠ It's my family's first time trying Filipino food, which happens to be one of my favourite cuisines and something I have on the regular, ironically, on the other side of the world in New York. Big thanks to @thrillafmmanila for introducing me to it in DC 3 years ago
‚Å£
When I went to Katipunans, a Filipino grocery here in Singapore, the owner was so surprised I knew what bagoong alamang was and asked for it (it's this really savoury and amazing shrimp paste). I'm so glad I was able to find some key ingredients here, and am really hoping this amazing food will take off everywhere because everyone needs to try it!!!!!

I made some of my favourite things:‚Å£
‚Å£
- sinigang, a sour tamarind soup‚Å£
- saucy chicken adobo‚Å£
- pinakbet with pumpkin, long beans, eggplant, bittergourd, okra and tomatoes‚Å£
- grilled bangus/milkfish served with a tomato and onion mixture and a garlic vinegar dipping sauce ‚Å£
- pan fried longanisa ‚Å£
