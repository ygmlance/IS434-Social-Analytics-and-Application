炸酱面 with homemade black bean minced pork sauce + tau kwa stir-fried with beansprouts make for good comfort food. Have a break, have a dark chocolate Kit Kat. 😜

Haha, I am actually eating beansprouts nowadays! Since young, my bro n I will pick them out one by one and leave them aside. 😬 slowly changing my mind about them apparently and the hubby loves beansprouts too.

There was one funny incident last time when the teppanyaki chef in the foodcourt actually kept offering free flow of beansprouts. Guess it helps i was there with beansprout lovers to help finish them all. 😵🤫
