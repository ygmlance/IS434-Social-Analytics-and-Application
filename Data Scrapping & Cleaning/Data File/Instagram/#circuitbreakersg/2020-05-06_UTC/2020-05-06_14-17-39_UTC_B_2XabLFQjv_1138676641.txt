Still remembered the day when the extension of the circuit breaker was announced and in that announcement, all cake and dessert shops have to close. My hubs rushed out to Awfully Chocolate but too late my Super Stacked was sold out! He then rushed to Rive Gauche to buy my favourite strawberry cream cake and got the last 2 pieces for me.

This circuit breaker has taught me not just about appreciating our family but also not to take simple things like the food we love for granted.

Looking forward to May 12th when cakes and desserts can resume operations again. Yaaeeee! üòç
