02•05•2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 26
After a rest on Labour Day to recharge my menu, today we will have a savoury fish dish. 🍲🐟🌶🍋🥬🐟
🕖Dinner:
-Szechuan Fish with Pickled Mustard Greens, Aka Suān Cài Yú 酸菜鱼.
-Stir fry lotus roots with carrots,sweet pea,celery and wood ear fungus. 
In Chinese, this dish is called 荷塘小炒, lotus pond stir fry in direct translation🤣 
Suan cai yu, a  Szechuan dish that features a hot and sour broth with super tender fish slice and  pickled mustard greens. It is not as famous and popular compare to its sister dish “water boiled spicy fish”

This dish packs such a punch and its so satisfying that you could not stop sipping it!

let’s Jiak !
