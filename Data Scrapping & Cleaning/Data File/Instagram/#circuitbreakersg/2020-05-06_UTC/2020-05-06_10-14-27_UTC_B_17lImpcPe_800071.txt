On-time delivery and everything was neatly packed, no spillage - kways and soups were packed separately.

Our kwey chap set consists of intestines, tongue, skin, meat, braised eggs and Tau pok. The intestine is so well cleaned, it doesnâ€™t taste or smell bad or bitter like other kway chap. Mum also approved âœ…
