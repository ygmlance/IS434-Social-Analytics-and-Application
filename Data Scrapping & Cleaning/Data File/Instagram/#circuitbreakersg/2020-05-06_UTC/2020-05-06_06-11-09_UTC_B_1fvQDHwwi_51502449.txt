I was watching @masterchefau last week and one of the ladies @courtneyroulston cooked Cauliflower Steak. I was curious and tried cracking at it today: Cauliflower Steak, two-ways, one with a paprika rub, and another with just olive oil and garlic. Pan-fried for a bit then moved to an oven toaster to cook thoroughly. Paired with a refreshing Shrimp & Tomatoes Salad with fresh greens and kale. Amazing meal! Never have thought that cauliflower can be cooked like steak! It is light yet filling! You guys should try - very quick to do in just 30 minutes, I am able to squeeze a very nice quick lunch whilst on a busy WFH day! 👌🏻 #cauliflower #steak #cauliflowersteak #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #workfromhome #workfromhomemeal
