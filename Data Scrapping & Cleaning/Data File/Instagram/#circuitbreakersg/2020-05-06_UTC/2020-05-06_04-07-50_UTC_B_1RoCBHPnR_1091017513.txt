#STAYHOME RECIPE: Throwback to the time I fried chye thow kway (the sweet-salty caramelised black kind is my fave too) in tribute to Joseph Schooling‚Äôs love for the dish. I wrote a story on him when he‚Äôd just won the Olympic gold medal. Recipe contributed by @willcookwilleat for @8dayseat. Pretty tasty even though I used generic supermarket radish cake to whip this up (see notes below).üòå ************************************** BLACK CHYE TOW KWAY RECIPE 
Serves two **************************************
Ingredients: 
6 tbsp melted pork lard or vegetable oil

40g garlic, finely chopped

30g chai poh (salted radish), rinsed 
300g steamed carrot (radish) cake, cut into bite-sized cubes* (from chilled section of supermarkets like NTUC)

2-3 tbsp sweet sauce (try Tai Hua brand)

1.5 tsp light soy sauce

2 large eggs, beaten

sambal chilli to taste (optional, try Sing Long‚Äôs ‚Äúnasi lemak sambal‚Äù) .
.
handful of chopped spring onions ************************************* Method: 
1. Warm lard or oil in a wok over low heat. SauteÃÅ garlic & chai poh until garlic is soft & fragrant, about 3 mins. 
2. Add carrot cake. Drizzle 1 tbsp of sweet sauce over it and stir to mix for 1 min. The carrot cake should turn light brown. 
3. Increase heat to high & add remaining sweet sauce. Lightly use spatula to press carrot cake down onto the wok so some of it breaks into smaller pieces. Fry until slightly caramelised & crisp around the edges. About 2 mins. 
4. Add light soy sauce (plus more sweet sauce and sambal chilli, to taste). Mix briefly. Pour eggs evenly over carrot cake. 
5. Cook till eggs fuse to carrot cake, using spatula to press on it gently. Flip & cook till lightly brown beneath. Remove from heat, garnish with spring onions & serve immediately. ==============================*For best results, make your own radish cake. Or buy from a hawker, wet market stall vendor or Chinese restaurant that makes its own. The last resort, says Willin, is the supermarket. .
