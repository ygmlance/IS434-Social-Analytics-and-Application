What is a calorie deficit? As a human being, you burn calories as fuel. To maintain your weight you need to be putting in as many calories as you are putting out. This is called energy balance.
-
Imagine that balance as a scale. To put on more weight (body fat) you need to eat more calories than you're using each day.
-
To lose weight (body fat) you need to either eat fewer calories, or move more to tip the balance towards being in a deficit.
-
🔥Your energy output is made of four components that burn calories:
-
1️⃣ BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) the amount of calories that are burned when you are at rest. So think of it as your heart pumping the blood round your body, your lungs breathing, your brain functioning etc.
-
2️⃣ NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) the calories your body burns moving day to day. Walking, fidgeting, heck even brushing your teeth burns a couple of calories. For example - my NEAT was high before #circuitbreakersg 10k steps compared to my recent ~1k steps.
-
3️⃣ EAT (Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) the calories you burn doing conscious exercise activity. That weights session, that swim, that run. That's classed as EAT. This is what I had to increase recently to tip my energy balance.
-
4️⃣ TOF (Thermic Effect From Food) These are the calories that are burned by your body to break down and digest your food. This can be as high as 10% of your energy expenditure with a high protein diet. So eat more protein and you'll also burn calories by digesting it! Cool eh?
-
❤️ For us at #onlinefatlosscoaching we know the easiest way to create a deficit is to focus on all of these. Move a little more, have a calories lesser meal, eat enough protein. It really is as simple as that! •
