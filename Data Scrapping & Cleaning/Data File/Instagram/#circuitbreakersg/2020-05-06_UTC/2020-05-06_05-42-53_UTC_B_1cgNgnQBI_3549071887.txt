CB Day 30 
Cooking and baking non-stop to keep my mind busy and it is  also my way of de-stress. 
Today, I tried cooking Thai style roast chicken for lunch. It turned out so yummy. The recipe called for a whole chicken but I decided to use whole leg as I prefer this body part when come to grilling as it will taste juicy and tender. The recipe required the chicken to be grilled in oven , I was lazy so I used air fryer and it turned out well too! Paired with the simple thai dipping sauce attached in the recipe (which I 
modify a little as I donâ€™t have all the ingredients), perfect combination. So simple to make and yet so tasty and appetising. This recipe is a keeper.

For recipe:
 1 chicken, whole (I used 3 whole leg)

Marinade:
1 lemongrass stalk, pale part only finely chopped
4 coriander roots, roughly chopped
8 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
1 tsp ground white peppercorns
3 tbsp fish sauce
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 tsp dark soy sauce

Spicy Dipping Sauce (Nahm Jim Jaew):
2 tsp raw glutinous rice (also known as sticky rice)(I skipped)
1 tbsp tamarind concentrate (I skipped)
3 tbsp fish sauce
1 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp chilli flakes (I used chilli padi)
1 small red shallot, sliced into fine wedges
2 tsp finely chopped coriander (cilantro)
