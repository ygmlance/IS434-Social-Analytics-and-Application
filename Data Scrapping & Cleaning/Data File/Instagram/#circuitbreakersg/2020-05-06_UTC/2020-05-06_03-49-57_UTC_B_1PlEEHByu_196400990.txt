Brunch today was Kway Teow Goreng Puteh Ikan Bilis, or White Fried Flat Rice Noodles with Dried Anchovies. Dried anchovies and minced garlic were fried in a wok at medium heat till fragrant and crisp, Kway Teow was added and the mixed well. A splash of light soya sauce and a little bit of water was added to moisten, and the wok was tossed to mix everything well at high heat. Beaten eggs were added and the just before the eggs were fully cooked, everything was mixed well again. Cubed fishcake, bean sprouts, chives and sprigs of Chye Sim, or Mustard Greens were added, and everything was tossed/mixed well over high heat until ready. The fire was turned off and a generous sprinkle of freshly ground white pepper was applied.
