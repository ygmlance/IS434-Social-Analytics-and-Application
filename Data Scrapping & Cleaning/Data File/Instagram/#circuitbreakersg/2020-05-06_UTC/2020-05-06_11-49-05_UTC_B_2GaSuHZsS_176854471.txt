Early phase of CB period we had Herbal Chickuteh and now Clear Peppery Bak Kut Teh as we enter the mid phase of CB.  What do you suggest when we celebrate the end of CB?

BKT using Frozen ribs.  I have stopped buying fresh cuts from the butcher/poultry or the chiller section.  Frozen cuts are just as good, no odd taste or smell as some describe.  Make do with whatever within your budget, at your convenience and the safety of your family
