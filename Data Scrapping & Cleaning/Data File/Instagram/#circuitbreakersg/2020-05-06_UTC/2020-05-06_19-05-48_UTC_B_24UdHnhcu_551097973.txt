Never in my life have I appreciated Multi Storey Car Parks (MSCP) as much as now during this Singapore "Circuit Breaker" period. Other than having a sheltered place to park my motorcycle during rainy days back when I was still riding, of course. 🛵

Most, if not all, fitness facilities are closed and off limits, be it commercial or public. Many regular gym go-ers have taken to exercising outdoors, jogging and doing bodyweight drills at PCNs. It is causing a mistaken illusion of "irresponsible" people rushing to exercise when they are too free and therefore causing overcrowding. Fact is, there are so many people who were going to enclosed fitness facilities to improve and maintain their personal fitness during normal times daily, they are just doing what they usually do! 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

So in order to keep ourselves sane and minimise chances of running into nosey people who don't exercise, @paigeisthis and I discovered the new paradise, MSCP. Wide open space, fresh air and minimal to zero contact with other humans. Peace and quiet to do our routine! ✌️

It is now here that we base most of our workouts. We definitely look forward to going back to our regular gyms workouts but for now, let us all appreciate what we have and what we can! Remember to keep your body moving people! \m/ 🤙Stay Safe and Stay Healthy! 😊
Let me know too, if you are keen to workout together, over Zoom of course. 
P. S. I really miss my speedball! 🥊
