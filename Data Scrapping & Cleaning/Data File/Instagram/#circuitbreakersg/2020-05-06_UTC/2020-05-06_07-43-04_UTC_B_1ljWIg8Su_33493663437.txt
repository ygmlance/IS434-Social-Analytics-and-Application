This will be the last video of this series. (30 episodes wow!). As we mark the end of the first circuit breaker, and as Mother’s Day is approaching. I’d like to honour my mom and mil here. Thanks for cooking for us as we were growing up! You both are my inspiration to continue cooking for the family!

This is a basic curry chicken recipe that my mil shared with me. It is, of course, no comparison to the 20 spices Indian curry as I am only using curry powder here. But at least some homemade meat curry for a change from time to time right!
