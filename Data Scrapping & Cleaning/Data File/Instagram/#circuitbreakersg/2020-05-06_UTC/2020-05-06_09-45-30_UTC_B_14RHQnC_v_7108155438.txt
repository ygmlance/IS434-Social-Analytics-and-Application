This year’s Mother‘s day, we decided to do something special for all the mums out there who have been busting their asses to deal with the covid-19 lockdown situation. Between having to plan more meals, buy groceries (and get judged for hoarding), cook every single day etc., it’s safe to say many of them are a little more exhausted than usual. If you’re looking for a way to show your gratitude, we have prepared a special limited time giftbox complete with 4 kombucha, 1 mini bouquet and a Mother’s Day card, all handcrafted with love from our team! As it’s hard to get flowers during this period, we only have limited sets available so get yours while stocks last!!
