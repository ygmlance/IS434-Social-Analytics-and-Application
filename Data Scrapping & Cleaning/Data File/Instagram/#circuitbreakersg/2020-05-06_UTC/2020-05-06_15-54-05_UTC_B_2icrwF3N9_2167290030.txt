DAY 30 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
CHATPATI ARBI
SPICY TANGY TARO (Gentlemans Toe ðŸ™„ never understood why its called so or where the name came from)

I make Arbi this way because this is one vege that irritates my throat if not cooked well.
So I boil it in the pressure cooker, one whistle,  just enough to be peel it. Then cut it, deep fry it, and then cook it in jeera and onion tadka (temperting)
The spices used are coriander pwd, cumin pwd, chilli pwd, turmeric pwd and amchoor (dry mango pwd). A dash of lemon juice & chopped coriander leaves before serving. .
