How to jazz up #frozenpizza when in a #circuitbreakersg ( #lockdown ): 1. Take your #frozen #storebought #caprese #pizza out of the box; 2. Slice up some #brie and #smokedduck that you have in your fridge; 3. Layer the #briecheese and sliced duck on frozen pizza; and finally 4. Spread some #berry #jam on it before popping the pizza into the preheated oven to heat up! Once done, take it out of the oven and enjoy a #jazzedup #gourmet pizza #dinner at #home ! #yum #stayhome #sgunited #latergram
