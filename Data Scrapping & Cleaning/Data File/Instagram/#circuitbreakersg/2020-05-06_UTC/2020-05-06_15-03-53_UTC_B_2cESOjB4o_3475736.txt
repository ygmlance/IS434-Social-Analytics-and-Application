Day 30 of circuit breaker, I put on a scotch tape over the door and give Leodys some balls to stick on the tape. While giving him the balls, will tell him the colours to let him recognise colours. He will have to figure out how to get the balls to stick onto the tape. In the end, he managed to get all the balls stick one line and he, being little mischievous boy, walk over it to mess it up. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #hbl #homebasedlearning #sensoryplay #colourrecognition #ballsticking #wfh #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
