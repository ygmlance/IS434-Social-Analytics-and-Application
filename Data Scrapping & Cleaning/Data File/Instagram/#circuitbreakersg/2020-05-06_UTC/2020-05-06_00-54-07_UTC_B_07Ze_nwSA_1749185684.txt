Day 2 Hols = Day 30 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
Cross Body Hammer Curl
#7dayabchallenge

Back to strength training.. Went slower a little as the body was aching a little. Felt better after the warm ups. Will really need to check out #heatherrobertsoncom workouts for the other days so as not to overtrain. If u do too much, your body suffers, so that's what we try not to do. Do you know the principles of training? 
Into Day 3 of the #7dayabchallenge, making me sweat like buckets.. Can't imagine with another one more workout to add on soon! 
Sleepy morning with cool weather to #stayhome #stayfit #stayhealthy
