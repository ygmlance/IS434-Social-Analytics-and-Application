The star dish for tonightâ€™s #dinner has got to be the Sambal Stingray. Wish I had banana leaves for the base, it would have been #perfect! At $13 for such a huge portion of fish I got from the market, it now makes me think twice about ordering it outside where $13 can only get me a portion half of this. ðŸ˜… But Iâ€™m not so pro, the #sambal is bottled #Belachan from Singlong... good enough for us!

I also made French Beans Stirfry with Minced Meat & Chye Poh, 1 of my fave veg dishes that I learnt to make from my Mum. And Steamed Codfish for the kiddos coz they canâ€™t take spicy. .
