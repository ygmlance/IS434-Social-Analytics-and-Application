For your safety, all shoppers entering the mall will be required to present their NRIC or scan a SafeEntry QR code to fill up their particulars for contact tracing purposes.  Shoppers can self check in and out through these two methods from 4 May 2020.⁣
⁣
Additionally, shoppers without a mask, valid identification or having a temperature above 37.5 degrees will be denied entry into the mall. As always, do be considerate and practise social distancing at all times!⁣

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation — let’s get through this tough time together! 💪🏻⁣⁣
