I love hugging Mummy's hand, placing her hand on my chest and sticking my face next to hers; Mummy seems to find it amusing but I know she secretly loves me doing all these. 🤭🥰 Daddy will look after/play with me if Mummy needs to be in the kitchen and I love to make him run on his hands and knees! 😝💕 ⁣

(Mummy: I love to listen the sound of them playing in the living room 😍 her very high pitched giggles/laughters and commanding instructions, and hubb's surrendering tones 😂) ⁣
