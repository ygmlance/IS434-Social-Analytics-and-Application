Now that eggs are a precious commodity, it's been a while since I baked a chiffon. I was asked to try and bake one for Grandparents for prayers because cake shops are closed. Of course I said yes! 
Glad to see that I can still bake a nice one with a smooth top. The lines on the skin came from the container because the cake is so soft and moist.

Natural colour of Gula Melaka with extra virgin coconut oil. Smells so good when it was baking!

Update: grandma enjoyed a slice and said "Jin phang" üòç
