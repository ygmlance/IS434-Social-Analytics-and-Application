Lunch. #homemade #quichelorraine with #choppedsalad 
I used #pancetta and #gruyere in the #quiche 
Quiche came out really well. Very pleased. #nosoggybottom 
Salad was chopped in that I had #lettuce leaves and I find it really hard to eat it because the leaves are huge and I get dressing all around my mouth when eating those leaves. 
Salad was composed of #tomatoes #avocado #onion #lettuce
