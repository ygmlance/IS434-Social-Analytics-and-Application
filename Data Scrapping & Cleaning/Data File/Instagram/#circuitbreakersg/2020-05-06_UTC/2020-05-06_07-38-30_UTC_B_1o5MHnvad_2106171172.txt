Was at Vivo city yesterday evening, to collect our takeaway dinner. The level three roof open space is empty - nobody else but myself. What a rare sight! And a good opportunity to experience the serene moments of the mall. It was not like this at all before the pandemic. #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #stayhomestaysafe #vivocity
