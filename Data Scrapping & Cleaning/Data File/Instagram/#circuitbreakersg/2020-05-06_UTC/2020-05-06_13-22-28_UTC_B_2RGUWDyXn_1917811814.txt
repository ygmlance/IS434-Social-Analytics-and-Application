Thai feast tonight...
.
.
After wife @emilynyuen cooked for some so many days and dishes, I decided that I should do something for her 💗
.
Thai Stuffed Chicken Wings.. very tedious process to remove the bones from the mid-point and stuff the minced pork, prawn and chestnut inside.. but very enjoyable and fulfilling 💪💪💪
.
And the dinner is complete with wife's Pineapple Fried Rice.. Aroi mak mak 👍👍👍
