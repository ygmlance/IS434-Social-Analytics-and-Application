💁🏼‍♀️TIGHT HAMMIES?!🙋🏼‍♀️This tutorial is for YOU!
.
I swear I need to stretch my hammies every👏🏼single👏🏼day👏🏼So thankfully these poses come in handy!
.
✨These hamstring focused poses will help you improve your flexibility (yay!!) and ease muscle soreness!
.
💖🙌🏼LETS DO THIS! 🙌🏼💖
Hold each pose for 5-10 breaths! Longer if you like or less if it feels intense. I also share some modifications - remember as long as you’re feeling a good stretch you’re in a good place. No need to force it!
.
POSES INCLUDE:
🌺RECLINED HAND TO BIG TOE w STRAP: Probably my favorite out of the bunch! I loooove this stretch and it’s one I like to do while I’m watching Netflix at night!😜
.
🌸FORWARD FOLD + HALFWAY LIFT: Be sure to bend at the hips. If you need to put a bend in the knees thats okay!! 🙌🏼✨Flow between the two poses & focus on lengthening the hamstrings
.
🌼WIDE FORWARD FOLD: Stand wide and bend at the hips. Hold center for a few breaths then move to each leg for a side stretch
.
🌻PYRAMID: Do your best to keep the hips square to the front of the mat. You can use blocks here for extra lift!! Fold the upper body in toward the front leg for a deep stretch
.
🌷STANDING SPLIT: This one stretches the hammies and works our balance! YAY! Upper body hugs into the standing leg (and you can always use a block here!) Keep back leg straight and hips square.
.
💐HALF SPLIT: Such a good one!! Start by keeping hips over back knee and fold in. Option to use blocks here and you can also try sinking the hips all the way back for a different variation!
