𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟑𝟎: Going local with my rendition of the popular Zi Char dish – 𝙎𝙖𝙣 𝙇𝙤𝙪 𝘽𝙚𝙚 𝙃𝙤𝙤𝙣 𝙖𝙠𝙖 𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙤 𝙏𝙖 𝘽𝙚𝙚 𝙃𝙤𝙤𝙣. Crispy vermicelli “pancake” that’s crispy on the exterior yet moist and springy within. Hidden beneath that crispy exterior are slices of lean pork, cabbage, fish cake and egg. Served with sambal belacan. #shiok⁣⁣⁣⁣

Not the most #instagramworthy dish but definitely one of the best dishes I’ve whipped up during #circuitbreakersg! Took a leap of faith and cooked it based on gut feel. I must say that I’m very satisfied with the outcome! #我不姓王 ⁣⁣
