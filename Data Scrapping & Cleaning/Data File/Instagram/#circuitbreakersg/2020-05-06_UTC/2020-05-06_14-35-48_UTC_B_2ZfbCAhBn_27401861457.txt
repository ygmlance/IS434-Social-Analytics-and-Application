In this lock down, #onekindhouse has been busy in other ways. We support theperanakan.com who’ve been providing wonderful bentos to frontliners. 2 Peranakan bentos for $10 and they don’t take short cuts just because it’s for charity.
Their business like all others is closed. But this allows them to do good whilst keeping their staff and families paid and fed. They’ve delivered over 1000 bentos and you can see the videos the appreciative frontliners have made on adoptabento. 
Also we like the Bibik’s spunk. It’s something #mummysoh would say. Being kind is also about speaking your mind in a one of a kind way.
Donate if you can. Share if you can’t. We all do what we can.
