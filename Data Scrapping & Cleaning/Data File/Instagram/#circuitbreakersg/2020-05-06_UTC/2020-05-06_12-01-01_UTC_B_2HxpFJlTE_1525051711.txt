#quarantips When you dress up to sit on your sofa and hubby dear clicks because after N number of days, he sees you in something different than tees, shorts and pyjamas 😝
.
Now, coming to an important point: Have you started feeling extremely lazy and bored at least sometimes during #circuitbreakersg ?
Here are MY TRIED n TASTED ways to KILL LAZINESS AND BOREDOM ::: #miniblog
.
💫 RECOGNIZE the fact that it's NOT HOLIDAYS for you - You still have to WORK and complete your tasks if you are  #ftwm and mom duties also!  If you are #sahm, usual work is always there and in fact more now because if you have temporarily stopped getting part time helpers from agencies like many of my friends.
.
💫 EAT consciously - Generally when you are staying home, you feel like eating and eating. Just think about your ballooned figure post-CB and start eating healthy.
.
💫  REMAIN ACTIVE - while #StayHomeStaySafe - keep yourself engaged. We are often  successful in keeping kids engaged but how about ourselves? So, ensure you are doing something - cooking, baking, gardening, cleaning, DIYing, playing with kids something...I sometimes just go and take a round of all rooms if nothing else is there to do 😅
.
💫 SELF-CARE - Who else is dealing with grass-like hair and monster-like eyebrows 😝. That's reality! But, we can take care of ourselves while we are indoors. Nourish hair with oil, tweeze eyebrows, use kitchen ingredients and do facial. All this will help to look better and to keep sane! Also, dress up sometimes and put some makeup on like how I have put in this pic.
.
💫 CALL, VIDEO-CALL - it's the best time to connect with friends and family members whom we haven't met for years. .
💫 TAKE Pleasure in going for GROCERY shopping and brisk walks - Breathe in some fresh air (via the mask), look around and appreciate little wonders of nature around you and buy some fresh vegetables. At the same time, remain fit and alert. .
💫 LEARN, RELEARN, UNLEARN - Treat it as a period to learn something new, relearn old hobbies and unlearn bad habits.
