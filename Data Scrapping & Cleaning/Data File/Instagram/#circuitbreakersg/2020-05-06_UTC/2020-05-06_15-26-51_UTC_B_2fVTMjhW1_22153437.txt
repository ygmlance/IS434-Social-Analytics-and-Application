Spending my Wednesday morning teaching the little one how to go down from the bed properly. He can do it very well when back at our place but strangely he forgets how to do it when at my parents place. =.= And poor little boy has been stuck at home since #circuitbreakersg started. The only time he can go out of the house is his immunization appt or KKH reviews. Grandma decided to put shoes for him to go gai gai at home. LOL
