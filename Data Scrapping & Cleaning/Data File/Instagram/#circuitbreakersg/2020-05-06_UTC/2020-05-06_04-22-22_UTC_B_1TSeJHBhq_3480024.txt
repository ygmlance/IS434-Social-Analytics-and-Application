Cir Breaker Day 30 Lunch.
Hong Kong Sheng Kee's steamed chicken and mushroom rice bowl for takeaway at only $6. 
The amount of chicken was actually quite generous, and I loved the side of Sichuan veg which went well with the chicken and rice drizzled with light gravy. Pretty decent and satisfying for that price
