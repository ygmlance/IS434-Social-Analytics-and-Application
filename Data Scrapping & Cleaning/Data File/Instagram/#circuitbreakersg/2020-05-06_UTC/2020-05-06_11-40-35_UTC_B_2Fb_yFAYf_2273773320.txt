| CB d30 | Roasted Meat Tossed Noodles
We were gifted a large platter of ÁÉßÂë≥ÂèåÊãº or HK-style Twin-Roasted Meat Combo today. It came from the famed stall in TB. It had both Barbecued and Roasted Pork -- just the right ingredients to whip up a bowl of #homecooked HK-style tossed noodles for dinner.
.
I usually prefer Siew Yoke over Char Siu, but tonight was an exception. My tastebuds told me why.
.
While the Roasted Pork was really good, the ‰∏çËßÅÂ§©ÂèâÁÉß BBQ Pork overshadowed with its lovely fat-to-meat ratio. Enough to make it deliciously juicy and tasty, yet not too much fat to make it sinful. Sliced thinly, they were so good with the egg noodles pulled from our pantry.
.
Tossed in our own #homemade sauce made from:.
oyster sauce, light soya sauce, Lee Kum Kee XO sauce, Heng's crispy prawn chilli from Malacca, L&P and our #homemade prawn oil.
.
Finished with blanched baby Shanghai Greens, my fave. Everything was downright yummeh.
.
And the evening light was super gorgeous. As with the handmade ceramic pot and #slowcrafted bamboo low-accent table (a one-off creation ü§≠. Pls tap for deets to support local).
