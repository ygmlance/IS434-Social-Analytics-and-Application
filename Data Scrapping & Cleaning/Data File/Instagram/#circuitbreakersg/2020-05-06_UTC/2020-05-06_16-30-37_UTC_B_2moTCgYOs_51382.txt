Happy 2nd birthday, son! ☝🏻✌🏻 This is you, waking up to the realisation that animals and dinosaurs have taken over your home. If it wasn’t for circuit breaker, we would most likely by out celebrating with our families and closest ones. But this is very well too, and perhaps all the more memorable.

We started with animals balloons; you love naming animals now and you can name aplenty. 🦊🦁🐰🐮🐵🐥🐛🐙🦓🐘🐳🐟🦒🐯🐶🐱🐭🐻🐼🐷🐸🦅🐴🐝🕷🐢🐍🐬🐟🐊🐫🦘🦛 But there’s one thing you love more, dinosaurs! *RAWRR* So that’s the main show waiting for you in the playroom. Oh, the joy when you see them, it makes it all worthwhile! 🦕🦖 Swipe to the end — I’ve included pictures of you when you are one year old (look how much you have grown!) and when you are just a few minutes old. ☺️ As you know, it wasn’t love at first sight. But, but. You have since shown me how deep and vast love can be. 
I hope you have had a blast so far. It’s been so awesome for me and I say this to you every night before you sleep, I love you so so much. ♥️♥️ #paulgohrj #2yearsold #happybirthday #collinandminfinally #balloonparty #dinosaurs #walkingpetballoons #cedelesg #mujisg #mujikids #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #stayhome #stayhomestaysafe
