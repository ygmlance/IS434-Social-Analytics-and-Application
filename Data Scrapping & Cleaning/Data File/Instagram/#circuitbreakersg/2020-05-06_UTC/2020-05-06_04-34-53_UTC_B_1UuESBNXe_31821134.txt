Hi Friends, 
This Sunday, 10th May 2020, 3pm, on Grundy Wellness Platform.

I will be doing a little bit of sharing of how I handle my emotions of handling 4 kids, HBL, Simple Pleasures, *Marinated Meats* Pay It Forward and now with the passing of my Beloved Mama. 
It will be a intimate personal sharing, which I hope will be able to perhaps uplift and motivate people who is affected with Covid19.

Thank you for your interest, Liking and  Sharing this post so we can create more awareness about Covid19 and spread more Positivity during this fragile and trying period.
