canâ€™t believe circuit breaker was initially due to end 2 days ago. and all i achieved in that month was... not putting on weight (which i think is a huge achievement), abit more hip opening, a few IG tutorials and IG Lives, and a lot of F45 Gravity with friends. basically have psyched a lot of people to do F45 ðŸ˜‚ i had such ambitious goals at the start of CB to create content but most days i am just not in the mood. WHY THO. anyway. presenting dead grasshopper cos thatâ€™s how i roll this cb. mostly feeling dead and lying down ðŸ˜‚
