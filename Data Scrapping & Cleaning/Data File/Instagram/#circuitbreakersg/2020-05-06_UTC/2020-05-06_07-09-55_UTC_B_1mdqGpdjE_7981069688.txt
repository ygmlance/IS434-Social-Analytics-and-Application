Roy Haynes with Phineas Newborn and Paul Chambers - We Three, 1959. This was Roy’s first album as leader, straight after he left Sarah Vaughan’s band. This is a funny record because it’s more about Roy pulling the reins on Phineas’ piano playing. “It’s a great session because Phineas plays ‘less’ which is still alot for jazz. Listen to the album and you will get what I mean. Paul Chambers can do no wrong. Overall this is a solid trio album that’s worth some listening time.  #royhaynes #phineasnewbornjr #paulchambers #wethree #newjazzrecords
