TOMORROW IS PUBLIC HOLIDAY GUYS😂⚠️it’s Vesak day 🙏❣️what a weird yet interesting situation when covid19 literally spared no festivities from all races and religions where all are equal in front of this invisible enemy🤔

⚠️SHOUTOUT TO SUPPORT VEGETARIAN RESTAURANTS TMR⚠️ a lot of small vegetarian eateries owners are elderly and have no clue bout social media etc. they really need much more support to keep their traditional and skills alive in these tough times!💪 AND some of them are actually nearby just walkable distance or a short drive away🏃 closer than u think✨ ...
@fyyvegetarian is on @grabfoodsg @foodpandasg with special menus for #vesakday and #mothersday - their food has less than 5% mock meat! Quite different from your usual vegetarian restaurants☺️💕super love their curry potato ring 🥔👍 they use monkey head mushroom to replace meat and surprisingly the texture and chew is so similar😍 the flavor is great also even though they DONT USE GARLIC and ONION😲 they also have 25% off takeaway!!!!!!🤯 DO SUPPORT!!!!! Totally not sponsored just simply don’t want them to close shop😣😢
