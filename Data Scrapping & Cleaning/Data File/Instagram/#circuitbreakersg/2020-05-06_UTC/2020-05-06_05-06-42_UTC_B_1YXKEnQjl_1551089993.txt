GIVEAWAY - Wow it‚Äôs almost 1 year ü•≥ since I first contacted Belgium brand @goegezegd to be their local stockist in Singapore, so I guess it‚Äôs timely to have a giveaway for their signature acrylic sign / quote which you can simply peel away from the card and stick it directly on your desired smooth surface! ‚Ä¢

1. Follow @heyhappypuff and like this photo
2. Comment with the quote you wish to customize (max 2 lines and max 15 characters per line including spaces) in GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE or BLACK in the following format:
(EXAMPLE) LINE 1: Priscilla‚Äôs LINE 2: Kitchen in GOLD 
3. Tag your friends who will love this customized self-adhesive sign! 
4. For an additional chance, share this on your IGS, but remember to tag me or send me a DM if your profile is set to private. ‚Ä¢
Giveaway will end on Saturday 9th May 2359 and only valid for residents in Singapore. Good luck! üòÑ ‚Ä¢
