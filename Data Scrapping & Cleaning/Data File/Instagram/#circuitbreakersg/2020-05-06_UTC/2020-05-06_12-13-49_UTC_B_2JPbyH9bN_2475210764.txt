Granola today! Make a batch for yourself or mom! You really just need rolled oats, dedicated coconut (optional but highly recommend), some syrup and any nut, seed or dried fruit you like. To note though, if itâ€™s a dried fruit, add it in after you have toasted everything. #mrsgansconfectionery #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #mothersday #granola #oats #coconut #syrup #seeds #nuts #raisin #fruit #brunch #breakfast #yoghurt #milk
