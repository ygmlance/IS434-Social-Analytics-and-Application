Michelle Obama says, "Choose people who lift you up."
Guess I made the right choice? 
These are some pair workouts ideas we played around with where the person being lifted are working their core holding strength in a dynamic way, while the lifter gets their typical lifting workout.

P.S. It took me a while and burning core strength to get it look "straight" and presentable (I was nearly falling into my face first time round), hence the constipated face. But it was an enjoyable and "lifting" experience doing this with my partner @pepsgoh . Try it and get fit together during the #CircuitBreakerSG period. 😉 Tag me if you attempted and #BePosiTiff ✌️
