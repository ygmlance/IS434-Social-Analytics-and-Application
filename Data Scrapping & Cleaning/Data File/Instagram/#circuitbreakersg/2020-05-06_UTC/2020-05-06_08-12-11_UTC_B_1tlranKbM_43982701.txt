Today’s bake - pang susi or bun susie. 
Seldom seen at stores these days, a Eurasian treat usually served during Christmas. The orange hue of the bread comes from it’s sweet potato dough enveloping a slightly sweetish spiced minced pork filling. My version is lighter using a softer fluffier bread recipe. #pangsusi #bread #homebaking #eurasianfood #sgfood #homecooking #heritagefood #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg #singaporehomecooks #stfoodtrending #8dayseat #burpplesg #sgeats #huffposttaste #buzzfeedfood #eattheworld #asianfood #foodgram #foodphotography #beautifulcuisines #tastingtable #feedfeed #f52grams #heresmyfood #thekitchn #seriouseats #foodandwine #gloobyfood #foodiegram
