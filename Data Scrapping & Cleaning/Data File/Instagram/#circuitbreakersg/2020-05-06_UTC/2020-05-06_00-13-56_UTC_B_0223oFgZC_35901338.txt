Blessed 51st month to our little princess @maelethsarah! Amilee and I are thankful that she’s happy to stay home, and has been doing so for many weeks already with no complaints. Such a lovable, precious girl ❤️
•
She’s been doing worksheets, reading books, playing with her many toys, playing new games on the iPad, drawing, exercising (she can do up 30 push-ups in one go now) and praying with us. We are so blessed to have all these tools and ideas at our disposal to help Mae stay engaged and learning during this season. 🥰
•
Even as the #CircuitBreakerSG continues until 1 June, we pray that Mae will stay happy and healthy, being able to learn and grow well. 
Prayers go to all fellow parents who are facilitating #HomeBasedLearning, as well as to all who are ill with the virus. 
We will get through this by the Grace of God! 🙏
