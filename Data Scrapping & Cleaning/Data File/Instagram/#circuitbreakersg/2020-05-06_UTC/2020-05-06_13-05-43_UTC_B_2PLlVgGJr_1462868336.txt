“You were born to be real, not to be perfect.”
-
These words really resonate within me, not only because they’re from someone I admire a lot, but also because I consider myself a perfectionist. You are your own person, there are some things that only you can do. Live up to your expectations, and yours only. Doesn’t matter if you crumble and fall, live on.
