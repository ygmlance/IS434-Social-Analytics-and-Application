~ Corn and Pea cream udon ~ Peas and beans have always been a challenge for the Simlets. Sometimes, they just don't like the powdery texture. I tried to do a balanced mix today with corn and pea puree. Cooked it in cream with chewy udon which they love. So lunch was a good affair. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecook #healthykidsfood #instafood #udon #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
