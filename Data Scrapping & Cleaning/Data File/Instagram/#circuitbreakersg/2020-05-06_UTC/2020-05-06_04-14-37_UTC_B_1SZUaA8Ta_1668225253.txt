We are already into the 5th week of the Circuit Breaker, here is another Care Car Tip to take note of!

#3 If you have to Drive, Do a Quick Check of your Vehicle First

As you have not been driving the vehicle for a period of time, it is important to do a quick assessment of your vehicle prior to driving.

Here is the list to do a check on:

Tyre Pressure
As tyres lose pressure overtime, it is important to ensure that the tyre pressure is sufficient to prevent damaged tyres due to underinflation. You may want to drive to the nearest petrol station to fill up the air pressure first. If you spotted an underinflated tyre, it is recommended to change out to the spare tyre to prevent damaging the tyre. 
Engine Oil Level
Ensure that the engine oil level is sufficient to prevent damaging the engine especially if your oil change has been overdue. Please do note that we are currently unable to provide car servicing during the circuit breaker period. However, if you must drive and are unsure whether your engine oil level is sufficient, you can bring to us for a quick check.

Coolant Level
Check the coolant level at your radiator spare tank, fill up coolant/water to the “MAX” or “FULL” line as marked on the side of the spare tank to prevent overheating of the vehicle. **ALERT** ALWAYS check the coolant level when your vehicle is COOL

Vehicle Lightings
Check that all your vehicle lightings in working condition

If you must drive but you are uncertain how to carry out the abovementioned checks on your vehicle, you may bring to us for a quick check. Please book an appointment in advance at www.htyre.com/appointment-booking or call us at 6293 3636. 
Take Care and Stay Safe!
