#circuitbreakersg day 30

Took a break from cooking today and went out to buy food and we ended up with 3 portions of noodles and 2 sides for 2 of us. ðŸ¤­

Didnâ€™t know that he was getting a one-for-one ramen deal at @tsutasingapore with a free side of gyozas (good deal! ðŸ˜¯), I went ahead to get wanton noodles from @engswantannoodle with a side of ngoh hiang. .

Best part is, we finished everything! ðŸ¤£ #dontwastefood .

Now, more than ever, Iâ€™m grateful for filled tummies. Because that is one of the few true essentials of life. #gratitudediary
