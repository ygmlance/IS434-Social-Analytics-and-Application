18 MONTHS YOUNG GISSELLE | It’s #circuitbreakersg Day 30 and Gisselle is supposed to start PG this month but we are delayed by one month now. 
This super duper active gal is nowhere near “slow down”. Covid have definitely bring our parenthood yet to another level. 
Gisselle’s defense mode is very high. I never knew a toddler’s slap can be so painful. 
She can say “papa” “neba mind” “done” “bye bye” “no more” “jie jie” “mine” “don’t want” all of that except MaMa 🤷🏻‍♀️😄😄. She just stare at me and call Papa like nobody business. But I still love you the same.
Hope when CB ends, school will reopen. Can’t wait for her next phase of her life to start. •
