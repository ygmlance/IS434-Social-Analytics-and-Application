PSA📢 Tune in to #love972 tomorrow (7 May) from 10am to 1pm. @leelian_chua and 101 consultant will be sharing what is right way to wash your hair. 
Meanwhile, here are some tips on how to wash your hair RIGHT! 
Step 1: Wet your hair with lukewarm water. 
Lukewarm water helps the cuticles of the hair to open up so that it can remove dirt or residue from your hair and scalp. 
Step 2: Rub shampoo into your palms and lather it. 
Step 3: Use fingertips to wash and gently massage your scalp in circular motion. This helps in blood circulation. 
The key focus is to clean your scalp because it will remove excessive oil out of it. ❌Do not use your fingernails to scrub your scalp because this may cause an irritation to it. ❌
