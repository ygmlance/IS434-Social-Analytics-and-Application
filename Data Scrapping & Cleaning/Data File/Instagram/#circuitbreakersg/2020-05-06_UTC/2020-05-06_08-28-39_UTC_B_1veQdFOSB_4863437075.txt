B & I spent the whole morning in our kitchen today. He made some #glutenfree muffins on his own, following a recipe I wrote out for him and then we made granola and a #paleo #bananabread together. Ended off with us making #pizza for lunch. We didn't have much in our fridge so we made do with some roasted pumpkin, herbed chicken, black garlic and onions. #homelearninginthekitchen #homemadepizza #busymorning #kitchenadventures #homecooking #kidscooking #kidswhocook #whatmykideats #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeandcook
