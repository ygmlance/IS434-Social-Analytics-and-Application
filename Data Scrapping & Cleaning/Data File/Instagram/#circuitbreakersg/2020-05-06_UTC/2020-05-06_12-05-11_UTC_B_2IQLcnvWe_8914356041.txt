With our market being listed as one of the 4 popular wet market, we can only go on either ODD or EVEN days basis. So today is my turn again to clear off and top up new ingredients for the week

🍲 Salted Veggie Chicken Soup

120-150g salted vegetables (咸菜), sliced
3 tomato, cut into wedges

3 cloves garlic
1 tsp white peppercorns, lightly crashes
.
Method
1. In a bowl soak salted vegetable with water for about 10 minutes, changing water once or twice
2. Meanwhile blanch chicken legs then rinse to remove any scums 
3. Place 1.2L water in stock pot and bring to boil before adding in all the ingredients (reserve 1/2 of the tomato) and continue to simmer on low heat for 30 minutes
4. Add in remaining tomato and continue to simmer for 10 minutes then season to taste if requires and serve .

📝 note
- you can use chicken bone, frame, breast meat or duck meat (duck requires more than an hour of cooking time in order for the meat to be soft) to boil this soup
