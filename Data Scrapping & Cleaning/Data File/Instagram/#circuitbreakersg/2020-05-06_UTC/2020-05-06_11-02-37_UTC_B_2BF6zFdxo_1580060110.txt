Fried Radish Cake (Chai Tow Kway)
--------------------------------------------
This is me going back to my roots and learning dishes that are part of Singapore's Hawker culture. The making of the radish cake is tedious. From grating the radish, to steaming it then frying it. The only way is to go back to basics before finding ways to reintepret or God forbid... elevate the dish. Definitely enjoyed the process of it though and I will trying to find ways to tinker with it. For the chili sauce, I mixed 2:1 my homemade ginger flower chili sauce with my sambal belachan for a nice salty, sweet and sour taste. I think it went pretty well.
