Asian Steak Tartare. Dan Hong goes for steak tartare on the menu every time. Ditto. Wagyu tri tip and mixed it up with kimchi, leek, Japanese egg yolk, Laoganma and some seasoning - goes well with scallion pancake which was made the third time and getting the hang of it. Additional dip of laoganma and chinkiang vinegar. #circuitbreakersg day23 #ibonappetit #mylollybellykitchen #isolationcooking #isocooking #isolife #quarantineandcook #quarantinecuisine #mylollybelly #lockdowncooking #laoganma #steaktartare
