It was a good pace chatting with @ruthingoutlife on her unexpected journey to explore running to improve her health. She shared tips on how to overcome the mental barrier, the need to wear proper shoes, to eat healthier, using a watch/app to track running distance and conditioning for better performance. 
Her advice for those who want to start jogging starts by jogging for 15 minutes then slowly progress according. Join us as we progress gradually! #jogwithjeff #jog5kwithjeff
