After seeing these ondeh ondeh babies going viral on social media, craved for it and so, joined in the bandwagon of making them as well😆 Google searched the recipe & also got some tips from my malay khakis. And so, came up with this modified version of ondeh2 recipe:

2 cups glutinous rice flour 
2 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp rice flour
1/4 tsp Green food colouring(optional)
Gula melaka (Palm sugar)

Pandan juice:
375ml warm water
15 pandan leaves

1 cup grated/dessicated coconut 
1/2 tsp salt

Method: 
Add salt to the dessicated coconut and mix well. Steam for 5 minutes. Keep it aside. Blend the pandan leaves with warm water & filter.
In a bowl, mix the glutinous rice flour, plain flour and rice flour.(Plain flour & rice flour are added to make the dough firm & gives a good texture. If you do not have rice flour, use plain flour instead). Add in the food colouring & pandan juice just as needed to form a dough. If the dough is too soft, add in more glutinous rice flour. Divide the dough in portions of roughly 25g each. Flatten the dough and wrap it with chunks of palm sugar in it. Do not skimp on this as you want all that goodness oozing out when you bite onto it. Shape them into small balls. 
Drop them into a pot of boiling water. Once they start to float on top, lower heat and remove them after 2 minutes to ensure that gula melaka has fully melted. Coat the balls with the dessicated coconut & enjoy!😋 #sirascooks #ondehondeh😍 #stayhomedessert #circuitbreakersg #firstattempt
