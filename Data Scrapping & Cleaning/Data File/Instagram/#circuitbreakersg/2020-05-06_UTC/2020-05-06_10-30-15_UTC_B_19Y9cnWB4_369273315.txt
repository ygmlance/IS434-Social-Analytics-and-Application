Omg it’s dinner time but I’m thinking of my cheesy hashbrowns & eggs I had the other day. 🤪🤪⁣
⁣
How about some baked hash & eggs to cheer you up? 🤩🤩⁣
⁣
When @mcdsg announced their closure, I immediately went to the supermarket to buy some frozen hashbrowns. I guess I’ll make do with frozen store bought hash browns. 😅😅😅⁣
⁣
I ending up experimenting w the hash & I realized that hash is such a versatile ingredient. I paired it w eggs, cheese & little bacon bits & it was heaven. ⁣
⁣
☀️Ingredients (Serves 2) ☀️⁣
⁣👉🏻4-5 frozen hash (thaw it and just go crazy w it and whack it into smaller pieces, if you have a child,call him/her over b/c it’s time  to practice his/her gross motor skills 😂😂) ⁣
👉🏻4 eggs ⁣
👉🏻Cheese (whichever you have in the fridge is fine, even if it’s the square cheese, you can tear it into little pieces) ⁣
👉🏻 bacon bits (optional) ⁣
👉🏻 Salt, pepper, garlic powder, herbs to season. ⁣
⁣
☀️Directions☀️⁣
👉🏻 Lightly grease your pan ⁣
👉🏻 Lay your crushed hash as the base on the pan. ⁣
👉🏻 Add 🧀 cheese ⁣
👉🏻Crack egg over the hash ⁣
👉🏻 Top it with more cheese and seasoning⁣
⁣
👉🏻Preheat oven to 175 degrees⁣
👉🏻 Put in oven for 7-8 mins or bake longer till eggs look cooked. ⁣
⁣
👉🏻Note: If you add a lot of bacon you need to put the pan in to cook the meat first then take out to add cheese and crack the egg over it & baked again. You don’t want overcooked eggs. 😅😅😅⁣
⁣
Enjoy & have a lovely Wednesday~ ⁣
