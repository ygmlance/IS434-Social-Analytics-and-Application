Had air fried beef lungs and beancurd last night. Food supply is depleting and I’ve applied leave for this Fri just to go to the wet market. Sound pathetic right? What to do when during this CB period, those with IC # ending with odd number can enter the market on odd dates and those with even number can enter market on even dates.

I’ve only beef lungs, a container of chicken, canned corned beef & tuna left. Last night, I went to the minimart near by to buy chillies, onion, lettuce, lime, lemon, tomatoes, eggs and some spices. I am really excited to get hold of my beef, fish and other seafood item from the wet market!

I know there’s vendor selling poultry, meat and fish online but there’s more option to choose from the wet market itself. Moreover, I miss pushing the market trolley. Since CB, I’ve only been to Giant SSC (3wks ago) and most of the time, just to the Ang Mo minimart nearby. Let me have my share of fresh air k. 😂 Home ▶️ Wet Market ▶️ Home, I promise.
