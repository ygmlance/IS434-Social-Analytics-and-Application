Oh my goodness- THANK YOU!! Today I received 63 orders from you. 164 MASKS have been pre purchased ! There are still 136 masks left. BW is sold out.

Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that I would print  my photography on masks and could sell that many in 1 day! 
Weird times indeed yet a wonderful feeling. I am so grateful for your enthusiasm to embrace my attempts to keep my business alive. I am working hard to be creative and am taking some risks with bulk orders of unfamiliar products.
The last two days have actually been quite stressful for me. 
Yet I like a good challenge and I trust you guys! 
I am quite  emotional right now. You truly are an amazing tribe to be part of xxxx
