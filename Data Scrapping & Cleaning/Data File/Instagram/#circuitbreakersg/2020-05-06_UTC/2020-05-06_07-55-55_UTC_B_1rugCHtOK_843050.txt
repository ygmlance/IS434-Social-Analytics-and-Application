6 May | A day for new toys it is! We got the tabletop #airhockey from Toys R Us before #circuitbreaker and kept it till now. In our household we ration opening new toys and practice delayed gratification, to allow the kids to fully explore each toy first before moving on to the new one.
.
The #airhockeytable entertained the kids for a long time this morning, and while #chrisellechin takes her afternoon nap, #josiahchin got to open his #Sluban we got some time back from JB. Looks like itâ€™s gonna keep him occupied for the afternoon too.
