Happy midweek homies! Give yourselves a pat on the back if you’ve had a fruitful day! If you feel you didn’t, no worries, when you are down, the only way is up!

Whichever you are, we could all use a refreshing glass of Floral Gin & Tonic!

Refer to the pictures for step-by-step visual recipe guidance, for pictures speak louder than words, and every picture speaks a thousand words.

P.s. The gin used doesn’t have to be Bombay Sapphire. We show that because you can get it from NTUC. But if you are a little picky like us, these are some gin that we really like for this particular cocktail as well.
