A pixel-art reminder for us to #StayHomeforSG this season, courtesy of @cuttuto! The self-described puzzle animators were inspired by the now-retired Solari flip-boards in @changiairport. While the #CircuitBreakerSG period has kept them from working on their physical puzzles, they've adapted to the season by designing pixel art and digital puzzles!

Thanks for sharing with us, and stay safe. Your dedication to your craft even during this challenging season truly embodies the #PassionMadePossible spirit, and to us, your courage in pushing on is inspiring. Truly, #ThisIsSG.
