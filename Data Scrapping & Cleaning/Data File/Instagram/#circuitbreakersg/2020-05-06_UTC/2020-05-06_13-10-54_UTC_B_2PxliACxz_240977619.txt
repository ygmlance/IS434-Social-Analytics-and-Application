Making sure I follow the rules and not get caught after my weekly run.
.
Isn't there something wrong when the reason I'm wearing my mask is because I'm afraid of being reprimanded or discriminated? Of course, at the back of my mind, I know it's for the better of all of us, but somehow, societal reasons have become the dominating factor. Herd mentality? Fear mentality? These are weird times indeed. .
My running sessions have become weekly check-ins with myself. Asking myself if I'm okay? If I'm coping, adapting, or just getting by? Sometimes, the thoughts just drift and by the time I realized, I've fallen into self pity. Then I'll spend the next few exchanges of breaths to pull myself back, and use my senses to bring me back to the 'now'. Reminding myself to count my blessings and be thankful for things that I can still see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.
.
Times are tough, but I'm hanging. One hand or both, it doesn't matter, because as long as I'm holding on, there's hope.
