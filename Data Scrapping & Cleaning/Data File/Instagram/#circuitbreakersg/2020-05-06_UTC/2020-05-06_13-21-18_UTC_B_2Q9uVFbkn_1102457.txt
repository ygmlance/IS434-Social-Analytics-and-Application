#CircuitBreakerSg Day 29 dinner!
.
Morganfield's launched New Cook-At-Home Meal Kits, just in time for this coming Mother’s Day celebrations! During this Circuit Breaker period why not make your mom feel extra special by impressing her with a nice ribs dinner lovingly cooked by you instead! Thank you @morganfieldssingapore for sending the meal kit over! 🙏🏻 I just follow the instruction card, basically open all the packaging and pop the ingredients into the oven to get the meal ready in 45 mins. My family really enjoyed it especially the ribs and Mac & cheese are so delicious! 😋
.
The meal kit (S$59.90+) serves 4-5 pax includes:
- 2 Full Slab of Baby Back Ribs with choice of any flavours (Somersby Apple-Glazed BBQ add S$8+)
- Mac & Cheese
- Garden Salad
- Buttered Corn
Ala carte order – Corn Bread (S$9.90+)
