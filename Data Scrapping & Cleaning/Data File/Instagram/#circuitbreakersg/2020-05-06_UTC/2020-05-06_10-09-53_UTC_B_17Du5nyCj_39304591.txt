[GIVEAWAY] One delicious discovery I have made during this #circuitbreaker period has been @keto.mei! 💪🏼 Up until this point, i had never tried the #keto diet as I love my carbs too much, but one thing i LOVE about this service is that it takes away the TRYING and makes things not only effortless but incredibly scrumptious too... plus I didn’t even miss the carbs! ♥️ Decide on which meal plan you want on their website - 6 to 21 day plans - then let them fuss over your macros while you focus on slaying your fitness goals. 💪🏼 Delivered right to your doorstep, each meal (lunch & dinner is sorted!) is individually packed in microwaveable containers & so very satisfying. 🤤 This is also the only #ketodiet #mealplan that includes local dishes so you don’t have to feel like you are missing out on anything!! 🌶
