the cheeseburger from @meatsmith_sg is terribly tasty! you can see the shreds of brisket that go into the patty - this is no ordinary burger! paired with melty american cheese and pickles, it is so simple yet so tasty. and at $10+ for takeout during this period this is a real good deal. looking forward to eat this a few more times ðŸ˜„
