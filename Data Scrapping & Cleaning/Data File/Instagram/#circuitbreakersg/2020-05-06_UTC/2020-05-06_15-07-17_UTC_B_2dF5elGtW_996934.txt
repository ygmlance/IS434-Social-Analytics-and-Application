#circuitbreakerday30 x #tbwednesday // Got a FB reminder that on this day, years ago, we were on a church #weekendaway at Latimer.

It was still spring, so the air was crisp not muggy, and Church Wood was carpeted with #bluebells. Forever grateful for these older saints who not only introduced me to the delights of #birdwatching, but also the joys of loving Jesus and being engaged in active service of the gospel into one’s 70s and 80s. “One does not retire from being a Christian.”

(Also, that authority only grandmas have to offhandedly remark to young strangers that if they were to climb trees, they would have to make sure to test the branches first, or risk breaking some body part in the fall.)
