[20.20 May 6: Circuit Breaker Day 30] The most value for money pizza we got to eat, made by the Chua siblings!
🍕 
Ok, they cheated a little by using store bought pizza crust but the amount of ingredients they loaded onto the crust was really generous! We made duo flavour! One Hawaiian pizza and the other BBQ chicken with the leftover shredded chicken. 😍
🍕
This is one of the holiday #Stayhome activities you can try out to keep the little hands busy and settled everyone's meal at the same time. 😉
