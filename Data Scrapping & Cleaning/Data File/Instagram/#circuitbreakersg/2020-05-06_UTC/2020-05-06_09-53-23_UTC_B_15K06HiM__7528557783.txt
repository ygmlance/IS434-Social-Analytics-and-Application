[Science in everyday life]
Science doesn’t happen in lab, it happens in Everyday life. 
This activity was inspired by Lucas, my four years old. 
When he was taking his shower in the bath tub, he asked me,” Why does the water flow out from the bath tub and the water level rises when he was in the bath tub?”
This triggers me to prepare this simple science experiment immediately to answer his curiosity. 
Things to prepare :
1) Two plastic containers of similar height. 
2) Some rocks or any solid objects any home.
3) Food colouring.

Firstly, I told Lucas to pour some water in the plastic container. Then I told him to measure the height of the water level in the plastic container and draw it in his journal. We then poured in some rocks. While pouring the rocks, I asked him what did he observe? He replied that the water level rises. He then record his observation in his journal. 
I further explained this phenomenon with “water beads” that act as the molecules. I explained that water has “molecules” represented by the waterbeads that are not closely packed. 
After pouring in the rocks, the rocks take up their space and pushes more molecules up to occupy more space. This explains why the water level rises when he submerge himself in the bath tub.  Children especially younger children are naturally curious. They asked million of questions. As parent, instead of providing them an answer, an activity with scaffolding can make learning an intrinsic one. 
In this activity, I don’t give him a direct answer. 
Instead, I guide him to find out his own answer. 
Isaac the 20 months old join in this activity too and he was pouring water from the measuring cup to another cup. 
Today, I was happy to hear from Lucas that he loves learning and learning is FUN. He likes to learn new things. 
This is what learning is all about!
