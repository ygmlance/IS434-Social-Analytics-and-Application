ðŸ’–Spicy Salmon Kimchi StewðŸ’–
Better eat more kimchi while I still can. Hahaha. The one food I crave most whenever I am on prep. ðŸ’“ Kimchi is rich in probiotics and hence, good for gut health. Itâ€™s good to add into a normal healthy diet. But on comp prep we minimise intake to avoid any possible water retention from the salt content. 
Bought the traditional ceramic pots serve at Korean restaurants to cook my stews. Replicate the feel. ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· LOL. But it really helps to keep the food warm and I can eat off the pot. ðŸ˜‹
