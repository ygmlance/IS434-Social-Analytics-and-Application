Korean BBQ in the house!
We derived so much satisfaction from our BBQ meat, kimchi pancake and beer+soju (Somaek). I just need to say this - it's Seoul-satisfying! It's insanely good!

Marinated meat:
Grated garlic, shallot, ginger - rub onto each piece of meat. Soybean paste, sesame oil, sugar mix and marinate the meat. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.
