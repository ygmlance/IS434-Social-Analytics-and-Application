This morning little activity that wasn‚Äôt so little after all. Just as I suspected, this activity is meant for older kids but kudos to Rey who still gave it a good go at it. At least they both are having a ball playing pretend.  I might even say too much fun, spent the last 15 mins picking out yarn from their mouths üò≥. I can only upload 10pics here so more on my highlights! ‚Å£‚Å£
