ARTSY HOME DECOR: Add a touch of sculptural art that is also functional in the home. This hand carved Giraffe Bowl is entirely hand etched by artisans from the Kisii tribe of Kisii, Kenya. Made from African soapstone, a natural rock, that can only be found in the region. Artisans mine the material from the country’s fertile Tabaka Hills and then work with chisels and tools to create beautiful designs. Men are in charge of mining and carving while women are responsible for sanding and polishing.

The material can be dyed but we kept the natural colour of the stone and in its natural tone. Use it for storing fruits, plants, hand towels. The creativity is yours!
