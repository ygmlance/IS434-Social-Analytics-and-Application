Old school butter cake for tea ☕️ THIS IS SO GOOD. And also to mark the first successful butter cake after several epic fails 😅 recipe adapted from @domestic_goddess_wannabe #mrsngskbuttercake . I also have a weird habit of eating my cakes cold, like just a min or 2 out of the fridge. 🤣 #homemade #homebaked
