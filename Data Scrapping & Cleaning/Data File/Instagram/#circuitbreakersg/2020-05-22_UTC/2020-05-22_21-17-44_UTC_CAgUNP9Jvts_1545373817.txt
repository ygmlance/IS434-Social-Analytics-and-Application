Aglio Olio, literally means garlic oil in Italian, looks like an easy dish to make as it requires just a few ingredients. Or so I thought. My first attempt was a flop. 
It was bland and dry.  I analysed what went wrong and corrected my mistakes as I cooked it for a second time n it turned out perfect 👌😋
1. *Choice of olive oil* - Olio means oil. It’s one of the main character in this dish. You will need to splurge on a bottle of premium extra virgin olive oil to get the right fragrance n taste. N a generous amount of it too! 
2. Garlic - Make sure that it’s cooked till translucent in the olive oil. Aglio means garlic n garlic infused olive oil is what u need to make this dish rock 🤘 
3. *Starch water* - this is the water w salt that u had used to boil your pasta. Keep some of it to add to your aglio olio. As this salty starch water is reduced as you cook, the garlic infused olive oil n salt will get attached to the spaghetti for flavour. N if it is not salty enough to your taste just add pinches of salt to it as you cook. Which was what I did as I didn’t add a lot of salt to the water that I had used to boil my pasta. This is a safer way I feel as u can control the level of saltiness by adding pinches  of salt to it instead. 
4. *Turkey Bacon* - In my first attempt I had replaced it w fresh pork belly cos I thot it was fresher with less preservatives then bacon.  The pork belly turned out hard n didn’t go with the dish at all. I used turkey bacon 🥓 in my 2nd attempt. While it is salty, it is this saltiness that you need to make it savoury.  Just put sparingly if u find it a tad too salty, like me. 
5. *Chilli* 🌶 - I love spicy food. I had added more cut chillies plus chilli flakes to suit my tastebuds.  But if u r not a “spice gal” like me just put either one of it sparingly.
6. *Spaghetti* - Do not overcook as you boil it. If it’s too hard or too soft it won’t taste good. 
7. *Parsley* n *Parmesan Cheese* - makes it complete 
It is a seemingly simple dish that actually requires a lot of tender loving care to make it great tasting.
