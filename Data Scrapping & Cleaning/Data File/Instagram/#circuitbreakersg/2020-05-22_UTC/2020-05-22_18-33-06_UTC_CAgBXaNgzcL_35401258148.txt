[PizzaHut] Laksalicious Pizza...i honestly hope it tastes as gd as it looks ðŸ¥º

I guess cheese doesn't exactly go well with the strong aroma from the laksa leaves. Not for me at least. But really good effort and generous on the ingredients.

I will definitely fall back to their good old BBQ Chicken Specialty anytime! ðŸ˜‹
