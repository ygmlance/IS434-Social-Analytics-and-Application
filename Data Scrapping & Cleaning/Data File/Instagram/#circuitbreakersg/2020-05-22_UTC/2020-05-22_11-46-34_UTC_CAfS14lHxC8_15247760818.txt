Sometimes, all I need is a comforting bowl of Korean-style bulgogi beef made with tender and soft pasture-fed Australian wagyu beef ribeye from @meatcosg on @redmartcom, super sweet Korean pear cubes 🍐(which we got from @laosinkianchoon fruit stall), carrot flowers 🥕🌼 (just like how my mum likes to carve her carrots), slices of yellow and red onions 🧅, chilli 🌶 and freshly ground black pepper, served with steamed Japanese rice. 🥰
.
@bibigosg’s Korean BBQ sauce is my go-to sauce and it’s great how it’s made with apple and pear purée, plus its fat-free and cholesterol-free! That gave me the idea to incorporate actual Korean pears in the dish for some layered texture and flavour.

Reminiscent of some of the bulgogi beef lunches I had last time with some of my ex-colleagues. 😊 Simple but satisfying. .
