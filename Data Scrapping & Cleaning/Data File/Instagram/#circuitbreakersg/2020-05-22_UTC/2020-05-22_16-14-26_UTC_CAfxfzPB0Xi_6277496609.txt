Japanese Sponge Cake. It's so soft and light, it's such a delight. And it's not difficult to make too. .
INGREDIENTS
Ingredients
100g cake flour (I used self-raising)
75g melted butter
60ml milk
1 tsp Vanilla extract essence
6 large eggs (I'll use 5 next time)
80g  sugar

INSTRUCTIONS
= Add sifted flour to melted butter and mix well.
= Add milk and mix well.
= Add 6 egg yolks (lightly beat first) to the above mixture and mix thoroughly.
= Beat 6 egg whites (I refrigerate them first so the meringue will be more stable) and add sugar gradually and continue beating until you get stiff peak.
= Add a quarter of the meringue to the batter (just use a whisk to fold it) and then pour the batter into the rest of the meringue. Fold the meringue into the batter slowly until it is almost uniform (tip: I read online that you should have some hints of the meringue left for an airy texture).
= Pour the cake mix into a pan (lined with baking paper that has been brushed with some melted butter - important so that your cake can 'slide' and won't crack!)
= Gently tap the cake pan a few times to break the large bubbles. You could also use a skewer to run figure-of-8's to get rid of the bubbles but smoothen the surface afterwards.
= Bake at 160 deg C for 60-70 minutes in a hot water bath (bain marie) on the lowest rack.
