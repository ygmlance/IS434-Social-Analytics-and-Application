#6 Prevent Tyre Flat Spot

Flat spot occurs when a tyre has been stationary under vehicle load for a prolonged period whereby the contact patch of the tyre can flatten slightly. In most cases when the vehicle remains stationary over a few weeks, flat spotting is temporary. Drivers might experience some slight vibrations during the first few kilometres of their journey. However, the flat spots will disappear once the tyres have reached their operational temperature and regained their normal shape. You can prevent tyre flat spot by avoid parking your vehicle at one spot and maintaining the correct tyre pressure.
