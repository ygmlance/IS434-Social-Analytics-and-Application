ACTIVITY 💡: Supermarket Storekeeper

This #circuitbreakersg has definitely gotten us to reflect on simple things we had taken for granted for, such as supermarket trips 🛒 Am thankful for @thejoylearners for gifting us these lovely supermarket dramatic play printables to help us set up shop right at home!

SUPERMARKET LEARNING
🔢 MATH - the kids learnt about actual prices of food, did lots of mental sum calculation and 1 to 1 correspondence.
🗣 CONVERSATION - more conversational Mandarin practice took place in our #funplaywithchinese 🤣 I would sportscast what the kids were doing, and speak in both English and Mandarin.
🛒 我要买东西 (I want to buy something)
🛒 这个___ 的价钱多少 (how much does this ____ cost?)
🛒 我要放进购物袋里 (I want to put into the shopping bag)
🛒 店关门了 (the shop is closed)

At the end of the day, the storekeeper happily declared the supermarket to be closed, and the shoppers went home to cook up a feast 🤣 - the play goes on 🥳
