It looks like #circuitbreakersg is extended. We are bumped that we canâ€™t serve our customers personally at both shops @essential.extra & @shipoftime. But it is for the better. We stand by Singapore government's decision and trust that we will come out stronger.

While it seems quiet at the moment, we are trying to get the hang of www.shipoftime.com. We know it is disappointing to only see a small fraction of the variety of goods online as compared to what we house off-line. We did not upload one-offs and brands with very limited styles and quantity. However, starting next week, we will cover them on IG stories. More updates later.

On another note, there are 4 of us working behind the scenes. It is not about a race to sell more. To be honest, we do not work everyday. During this unusual hibernation, we made a mindful decision to unwind, reevaluate and stay close to loved ones. We want to build a brand culture that nurture and feed our souls. Money cannot buy more time or love. So we are ok earning less. We go steady and move with our conscience and values intact.

Meanwhile, stay sane! Have a great weekend!
