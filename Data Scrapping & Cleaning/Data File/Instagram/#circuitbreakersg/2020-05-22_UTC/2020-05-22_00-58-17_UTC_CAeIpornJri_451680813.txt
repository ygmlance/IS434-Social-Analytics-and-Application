Happy Kindness Day! Let’s remember to be kind, gracious, and empathetic all year round. Here are some ways to exercise your kindness muscles:
- Do your part to stay safe during our Circuit Breaker (and thank your neighbours when they help with buying groceries!)
- Give your loved ones a call to remind them they’re not alone
- Be patient with delivery frontliners as they rush to get orders to you

How are you being kind today?
