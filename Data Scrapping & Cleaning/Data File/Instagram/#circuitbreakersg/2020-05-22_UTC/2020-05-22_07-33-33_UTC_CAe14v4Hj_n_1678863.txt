In the past 2 months staying home, I’ve been adding a new beauty oral supplement to my beauty regime - 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘄𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗥𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲. @heliocaresg I started on this regime ‘cos I wanna stop feeling dreadful of waking up and going to bed with dull and rough scaly skin, it’s not even pleasant or smooth to touch and I felt like I’ve aged for a few yrs while staying home 😪 So I decided to stop being lazy, stop neglecting the importance of skincare and skin radiance while staying home, and just do something.

I consume 2 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘄𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗥𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 pills daily, and I’m still taking it. It’s formulated with the brand’s key patented ingredient, Fernblock and has powerful Antioxidant abilities, DNA repair 🧬 and protection function, and aid in improving overall skin tone and clarity. Did I also mention anti-Aging capabilities??!! I’m now at this life stage whereby I really need to carefully watch what I eat and apply to my body. Am not getting any younger so if a product claims to have anti-Aging properties, I’m up for testing! 🥰

After consuming the supplement for close to 2 months, I personally find that 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘄𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗥𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 is a good start for aging prevention and maintenance of the radiance skin we’re all dreaming of. Although I go to bed at unearthly hours (uhh... I sleep at dawn), this has been a wonderful complement to my usual skincare regime, and my skin is no longer feeling dry and dull. I wake up daily to a smooth touch and improved skin clarity. And it doesn’t seem like I’ve only been sleeping 4-5 hours a day! I feel that having this as an oral supplement does make a difference to my skin during this #circuitbreakersg period. 👍🏻
