❤️ All of us have our fair share of struggles during this period of uncertainty. Some of us might be feeling overwhelmed, or even depressed. It has never been more important to be mindful of what we are going through emotionally and mentally. ❤️ And we are so thankful for these leaders who selflessly take time to prepare and share motivational messages daily since the start of Circuit Breaker. ✨ They offer different perspectives, new hopes and remind us that we are in this together and that we are not alone! 🤜🤛 Thank you Alan Sim, Anthony Anthonio, Brittany Ng, Julian Tan, Melvin Liu, Ong Gim Teng, Ng Eng Beow! 💌

Another week before SG exits circuit breaker, and as we transit and adjust into a ‘new norm’, HANG IN THERE, stay well and stay safe! 💪
