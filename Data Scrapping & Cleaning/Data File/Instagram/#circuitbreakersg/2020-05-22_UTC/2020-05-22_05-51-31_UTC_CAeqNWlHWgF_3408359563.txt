Day 46 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (22 May 2020) - #nofilter #simplelunch - Had a lot of yellow noodles and kway teow #leftover so I had #homecooked #charkwayteow again; this time, substituting the Chinese sausage with #stirfriedbeef in memory of a canteen stall in the neighbouring Arts faculty canteen when I was in university (only place that I tasted local style char kway teow with beef). Think I over-seasoned the beef slightly and would have preferred thinner slices (the slices came as packed), but still quite #yummy ! Only 10 more days to go, #stayhomestaysafe everyone! ðŸ˜‰ #homecooking
