#Circuitbreakersg Day 46

East + West = Friday's drink
. 
TGIF everyone!
.
Welcoming the start of a long weekend with my own version of a Japanese highball .
People who know me know I usually have my whisky neat or on the rocks. But since I have peach calpis soda and whisky, I decided to mix them both! .
It's actually pretty yummy! I'd better go easy, cos we all know yummy drinks are more dangerous 😜 .
Cheers! Kanpai! 🥃
