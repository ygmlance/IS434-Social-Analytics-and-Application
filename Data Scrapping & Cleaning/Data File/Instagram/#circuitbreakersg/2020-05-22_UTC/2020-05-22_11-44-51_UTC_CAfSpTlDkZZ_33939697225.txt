~ Kimchi Fried Rice Chicken ~ It's a tired friday for me. The younger Simlet is sprouting his final few teeth and was whining every 20 minutes whole night long...So its a one pan dinner night. For the two of them, instead of kimchi, I turned it into tomato fried rice. It looked similar so they have no complaints.
