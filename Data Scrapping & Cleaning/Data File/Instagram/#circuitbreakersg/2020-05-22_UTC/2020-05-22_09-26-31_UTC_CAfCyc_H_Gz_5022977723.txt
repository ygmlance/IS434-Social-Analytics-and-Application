The DIY mask of the week is the LCH mask (Lemon+Cinnamon+honey)! ⁠
.⁠
Lemons are packed with Vitamin C, which are known to lighten pigmentation and exfoliate the skin. Cinnamon helps to reduce inflammation, redness and soaks up excess oil when applied on the face. The honey helps to balance the bacteria on the face and speed up skin cell’s healing. ⁠
.⁠
Mix the Lemon and honey, gently massage the mixture onto your face and leave it on for 15-20 minutes, then rinse off. ⁠
.⁠
Go light on the lemon, as the acids can cause irritation to the skin. The perfect time to try this since you’re staying home and not having much sun exposure.⁠
