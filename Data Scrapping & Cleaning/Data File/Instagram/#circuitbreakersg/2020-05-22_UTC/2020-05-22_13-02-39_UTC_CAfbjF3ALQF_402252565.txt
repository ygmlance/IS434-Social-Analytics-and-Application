Yes we had been posting lots pink, cos the pink flowers in that gifted bouquet are just too pretty not to snap more photos with them 😍OK, now that the pink flowers have left us one after another, we shall have something different — another of our fav: black & white 😍 tea time like this is simply so refreshing ✨ Some new picks can be found in this photo. Will be available in our webstore tomorrow 😉

And here’s a special shoutout to @littlehouseofdreams for their awesome brownies! The fudge brownie with crackly shell on top is OMG so yummy 😋 .

Long weekend is here! Time to rest, relax and recharge ❤️
