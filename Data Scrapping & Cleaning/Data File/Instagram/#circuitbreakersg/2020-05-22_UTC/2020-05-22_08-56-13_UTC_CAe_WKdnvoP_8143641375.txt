Sudden craving for some ramen & Japanese food during this "lockdown" period brought me to this restaurant that i saw on FB a few weeks ago.
And it was worth the trip as all of the dishes was delish or Oishii as they say it in Japanese.

Garlic Pork Chop Ramen $13.90. One of their best seller.

Yakiniku Bento $9.80. The thinly sliced Pork strip resembles that of Yoshinoya's beef strip.

Oyako Don $6 only w/ purchase of mains.

Best deal is the $2 Tiger Beer Crystal add on. Beer plus food never goes wrong. üçª

Let's eat!
