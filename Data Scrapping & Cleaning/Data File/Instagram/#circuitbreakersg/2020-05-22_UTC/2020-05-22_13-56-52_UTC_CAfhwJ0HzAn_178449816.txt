Day 46 of #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Happy food today! Did my supermarket shopping at Jewel today and rewarded myself with Shake Shack which Iâ€™ve been craving since last week. Jewel is sadly pretty empty so it feels very safe to be here as compared to a neighbourhood mall
.
Shake shack totally hit the spot. I got the double patty to make my visit worth it as I may not return for a while. Cheese fries arenâ€™t really cheesy tasting so Iâ€™ll give it a miss next time. I was there around 12 noon. Took about 2 minutes before my turn to order, and waited 5-10 minutes for food. See my instastories for videos!
.
And yes your eyes arenâ€™t playing tricks on you. Thatâ€™s KOI you see there. I myself could hardly believe it when I saw a queue. Apparently @signature_by_koi can be open as they also sell pastries. The konjac boba.... ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
