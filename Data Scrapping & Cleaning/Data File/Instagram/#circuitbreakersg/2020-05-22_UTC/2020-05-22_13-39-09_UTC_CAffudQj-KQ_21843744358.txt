We will be exiting the #CircuitBreaker in a few days' time into Phase One 🥳🎊🎉, which is Safe Re-Opening. Hurray! ❤

However, under that phase, restaurant dine-ins are still not allowed, which means that it will be some time before the F&B industry can thrive once more. 🍽  Which is all the more why we need to support our #localfnb to ensure that they are still standing in the post-Covid era. 😘😘😘 We've put up a list of 10 local F&B brands that you can support and keep alive during this crucial period. Visit the link in our Bio! 😊
