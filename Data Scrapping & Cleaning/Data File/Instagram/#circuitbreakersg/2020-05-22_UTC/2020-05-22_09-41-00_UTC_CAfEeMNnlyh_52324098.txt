If you were as fortunate as my kids, you will know these gorgeous Potato Soughdough Buns by @droolcookclub were absolutely perfect to hug my grilled Cajun Chicken and Salsa Sauce.
.
These buns were fantastic sliced half and heated on the grill. The outside crisps quickly while the inside retained its softness, a perfect bite with the succulent grilled Cajun chicken and fiesta Salsa!
.
I forgot cheese which my kids added separately but hey, give me the bun and chicken anytime. I have to say both kids loved it.
.
As always if it‚Äôs Cajun, I‚Äôm loving #slapyourmamaseasoning . Added a layer of fresh salsa pureed to a sauce for the base of these buns and the buns held up without turning soggy at all.
.
I‚Äôm going to need more buns @droolcookclub when can I come by üòÅ

Can I just say, if you‚Äôre going to make the effort of a DIY burger, you should consider ordering these! DM @droolcookclub
