Savouring every single bite, I utterly enjoyed @ganache.sg ’s signature Pandan Chiffon ($22). One of the best renditions I have tasted, the homemade cake was soft, airy, and surprisingly moist. In all its simplicity and glory, the classic flavour was done superbly well. Freshly baked with no artificial colouring, flavouring or preservative; what stood out for me was the irresistible and distinctive fragrance that just lingers gently in the mouth. The cake was also not overly sweet, great for tea time and breakfast. Just fluffy perfection! So good that I have since ordered a handful of times.
