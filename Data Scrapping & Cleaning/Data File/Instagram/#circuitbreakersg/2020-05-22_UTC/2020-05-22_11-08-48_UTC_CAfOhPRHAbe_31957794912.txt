Chicken wings kinda night. Ayam Kunyik - a typical Indonesian/ Peranakan style chicken marinated in tumeric, ginger, curry leaves n garlic then baked. Tossed a quick Greek yogurt dip of chopped cucumbers n onions n a splash of lemon juice. Great combi! A quick prep of only 45 mins including bake time. .

I simply cannot put this book down. #whenbreathbecomesair📖 is a deeply moving and gripping story of the late Dr Kalanithi’s life in the face of mortality. It’s an extraordinary account of life’s perennial questions on family, love, fears & his medical journey in neuroscience; and life’s experiences through his eyes immortalised in this one indelible book. An exceptionally inspiring read that just makes you want to sit for hours on end. Who loves the intoxicating smell of new books like I do & the thrill of starting on a new title? It gives me a certain kind of ecstasy. I’m weird that way. 😝
