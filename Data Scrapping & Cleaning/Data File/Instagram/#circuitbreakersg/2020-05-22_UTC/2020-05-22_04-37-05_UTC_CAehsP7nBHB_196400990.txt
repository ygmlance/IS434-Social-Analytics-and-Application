Brunch today, was a variation on Seafood Fried Kway Teow. Lard and minced garlic were sweat until fragrant, Kway Teow, or flat rice noodles were thrown in, as was a drizzle of fish sauce and a splash of prawn stock, to moisten things up. Beaten eggs were added, and when nearly set, it was stirred into the noodles. Medium-sized prawns and sliced fishcake was thrown in, as was bean sprouts, thin sliced white cabbage and chopped mustard greens. These were tossed with the noodles, with another splash of prawn stock added, again for moisture. When the vegetables were still crisp but almost cooked, a couple of swirls of superior dark soya sauce was added, and incorporated into the noodles. When well mixed, Sambal Belachan, or fermented shrimp chilli paste was added, and folded into the noodles. Served hot! Delicious! But, hot, hot, hot, because i put in too much chilli! ðŸ¥µ #seafoodcharkwayteow #toomuchchilli #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
