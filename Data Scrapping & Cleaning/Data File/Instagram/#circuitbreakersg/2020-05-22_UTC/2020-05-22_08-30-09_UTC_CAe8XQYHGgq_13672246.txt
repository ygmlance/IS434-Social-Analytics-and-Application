⁣| Who is Miss Nanny? |⁣
⁣
Since the start of #circuitbreakersg, Missy A looks forward to watch her tv shows once I am done with my lessons at the end of each day. 😏Our family favorite is the Muppet Babies as I grow up with Sesame Street cartoons during my childhood. 🙂⁣⁣
⁣⁣
While I am busy marking today, she created this and I found this to be very familiar but I can’t identify the name of this character.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
“Mommy, she is Miss Nanny from Muppet Babies!”⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Missy Nanny is the caretaker of the Muppet children at her daycare. Do you notice that in most of the cartoon episodes, she is usually seen only from shoulders down? 🙂
