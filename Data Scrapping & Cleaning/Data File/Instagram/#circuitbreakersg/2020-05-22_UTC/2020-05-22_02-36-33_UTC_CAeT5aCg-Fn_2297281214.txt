Repost from @osteopathichealthcare
‚Ä¢
Friday, or FriYAY, is the last day of the working week for many and it's time to unwind and relax!
Your neck and shoulders must be tired and achy either from hunching over the computer, the Marie Kondo-ing to clear house clutter or that dough kneading for you home bakers and cooks!
@osteopathichealthcare's David Farrelly @paddlingosteo.singapore is going to demonstrate another stretch that may help you unwind and relax the neck and shoulders
Neck/Shoulder Stretches
‚Ä¢ Place one hand behind your back
‚Ä¢ Keep your body upright
‚Ä¢ Relax your shoulders
‚Ä¢ Slowly look down towards the opposite hip
‚Ä¢ You may use your hand to hold the top of your head and gently increase the stretch if needed. Do try and let gravity do most of the work and don't force the action
‚Ä¢ Hold the stretch for 15 seconds
‚Ä¢ Repeat 4 times on each side
