Napa cabbage homemade kimchi from @saltfordaysco 😋
A traditional korean dish that is often served as side dish, paired w bbq meat and even fried rice!
Kimchi’s flavour is complex, but the main notes include sour, spicy and umami! It definitely hit all three 👍🏻
Just $15 and this bottle of kimchi will reach your doorstep with free islandwide delivery during this Circuit Breaker!!
Do check them out ✌🏻
