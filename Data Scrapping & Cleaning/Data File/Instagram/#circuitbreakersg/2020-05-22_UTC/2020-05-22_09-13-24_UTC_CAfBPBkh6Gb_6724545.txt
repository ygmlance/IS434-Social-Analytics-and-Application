Another video to share for the Circuit Breaker period.

Brown Sugar Tapioca Pearl Milk Tea

Ingredients for Pearls:

1/3 Cup of Water
1/4 Cup of Brown Sugar 
1 Cup of Tapioca Starch

Ingredients for Brown Sugar Syrup:

1 Cup of Brown Sugar
2 Cups of Water

For better result, use dark brown sugar instead of the light brown sugar that I used in the video. I couldn't find any dark brown sugar during this period!
