It was a fun drawing session with Rob @rbiddulph yesterday! Now I realised why the kids love his drawing videos! He makes it easy to follow and fun to learn drawing. I stayed up last night to participate in the world's largest ever online art lesson and ended up with this record breaker whale. My whale isn't as good as Rob's but the kids loved it and now they want to draw one too. Shall post when their drawing is ready! Thank you @rbiddulph and @art.worldrecords for organising this!
