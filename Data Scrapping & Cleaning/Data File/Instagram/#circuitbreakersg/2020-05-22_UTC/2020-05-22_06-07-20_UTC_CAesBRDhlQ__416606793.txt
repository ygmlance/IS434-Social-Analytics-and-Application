Circuit breaker day 46 (Friday 22/5/2020)
Kuching Butter Buns
Made 2 batches today. Someone told me she kept thinking about the buns after trying it the other day. ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
And my daughter says all time favourite. 
This time round, the sweet bun texture is really soft and fine.  A little modification makes a difference.
