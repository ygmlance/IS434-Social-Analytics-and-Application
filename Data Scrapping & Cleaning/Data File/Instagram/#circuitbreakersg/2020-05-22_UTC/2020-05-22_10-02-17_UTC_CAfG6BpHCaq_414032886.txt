What is your #grateful moment for this week? I am grateful for my guinea pigs in da house- 𝗞𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀, 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 and 𝗦𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 for trying out my gourmet cuisine that probably only a few would appreciate. I think they should be grateful to me that I did not burn down the house while trying out those trendy recipes. 😏
