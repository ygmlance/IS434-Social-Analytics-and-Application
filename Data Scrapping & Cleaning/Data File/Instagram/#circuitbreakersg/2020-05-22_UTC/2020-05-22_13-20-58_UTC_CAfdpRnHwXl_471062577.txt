a #CB party ðŸŽˆ .
.
we were looking forward to host a slightly bigger party for meimeiâ€™s first birthday since we didnt do manyue nor 100days.. but alas, that little dream cant be fulfilled due to circuit breaker measures..
.
so we scaled back - cancelled the venue and arrangements, and made do with a cozy celebration with just us.. was jittery about the cake coz we didnt know if the shop could be opened and be in time for her celebration.. days passed and thankfully, the shop updated us that its a go ahead for them! yay! BUT alas, on the eve of the celebration, we were hit with the bad news about her birthday cake being smudged and cant be consumed.. my heart juz broke..
.
thank god for a lovely lady and a baker, meimei received a beautiful cake on the actual day and we could still have a tokified celebration..
.
amidst all the â€˜excitementâ€™, meimei has been very blessed to receive gifts / ang baos / birthday greetings from all over.. thank you, for the love.. indeed a memorable first party for meimei..
