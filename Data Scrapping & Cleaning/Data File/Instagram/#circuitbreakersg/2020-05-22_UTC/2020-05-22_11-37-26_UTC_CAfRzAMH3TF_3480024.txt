Cir Breaker Day 46 Dinner.

We were supposed to go out and buy dinner, but the sudden thunderstorm wrecked our plan, so I ended up cooking an impromptu dinner of Japanese oden soup with tang oh and enoki mushrooms to go with rice.
The Mister said the oden were really yummy and make him miss Japan so much. Hehe. Of course these oden were good cos I bought them from Don Don Donki, and the big pack comes with 2 small packets of oden stock. I only used half of the oden and kept the rest. Just need to heat up everything over the stove and serve up. A quick, no fuss and delicious meal.
Anyway, welcome to the long weekend again peeps. Let's take it easy at home yeh?
