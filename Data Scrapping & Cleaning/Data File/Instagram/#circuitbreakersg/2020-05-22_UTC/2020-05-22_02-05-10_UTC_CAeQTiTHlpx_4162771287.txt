Day 46 of circuit breaker (22/5/2020).
.
Woke up super early to get ready for appointment. .
.
Even though this old wooden keychain has been on my table for a long time, God is good to let it catch my attention and focus on the verse engraved on it ! .
.
Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I entrust my life. ~ Psalms 143:8 NIV
.
Thank You Lord!!!!
