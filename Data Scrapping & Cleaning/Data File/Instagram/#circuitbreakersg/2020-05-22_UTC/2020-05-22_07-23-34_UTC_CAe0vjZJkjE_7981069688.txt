Bill Evans & Jim Hall - Intermodulation, 1966. This is the follow-up to Undercurrent from 1962. These were the only times these two jazz icons collaborated. The music is beautiful as you’d expect from a duet and their masterful improvs are a joy to listen. Got me wondering about other piano-guitar duets. Lots of guitar with the organ but I can’t name another piano-guitar project. Hmmm. Hopefully MOFI reissues this one as they did the first edition.  #billevans #jimhall #intermodulation #ververecords
