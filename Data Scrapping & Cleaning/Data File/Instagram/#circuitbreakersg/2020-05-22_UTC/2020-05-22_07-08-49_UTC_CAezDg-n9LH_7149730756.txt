“My mom went blind when I was only seven and I had to help support my family at a very young age. Acting as my mother's eyes, we lugged bags of tidbits and tissue paper, selling them on the streets and in hawker centres.⠀
⠀
Life was hard for us and we were never sure if there would be enough food on the table. Besides constantly worrying about financial stability, my academic results were poor. When my mom was diagnosed with kidney failure, I had to accompany her for dialysis sessions, taking time away from my studies, causing my results to deteriorate further. ⠀
⠀
Fortunately, I was blessed with good peers and mentors who helped me. They are one of the main reasons why I made it through university, before becoming a teacher and eventually a Community Partnerships Officer with MOE where I support students from disadvantaged families. I'll never forget one of my mentors who gave me $50 when I was younger and in need of money. When I asked her when I could return the money, she simply replied: “Pay it forward”.⠀
⠀
It's been more than 15 years since then, but this is a philosophy I still live by. Growing up in a one-room rental flat, I was especially empathetic to the plight of large families living in small rented houses, without the money to afford basic meals. This motivated me to start @projectstablestaples, aimed at helping such households cope with the loss of income due to the COVID-19 situation. Today, Project Stable Staples has supported more than 266 families. By providing free grocery vouchers to each member fortnightly, we hope they will get some 'stable staples'. ⠀
⠀
The COVID-19 situation is unprecedented in our lifetimes and will continue to impact the most vulnerable. I strongly believe that we shouldn't turn a blind eye to their needs. We should pass on our blessings to others whenever we have the capacity to do so.⠀
⠀
Today, I’m still paying it forward. I choose to power kindness." ⠀
