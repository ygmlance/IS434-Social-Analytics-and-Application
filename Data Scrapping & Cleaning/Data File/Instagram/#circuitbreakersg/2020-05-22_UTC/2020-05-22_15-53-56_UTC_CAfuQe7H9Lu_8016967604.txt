My cheeky 5 year old has cooked up a plan to warm his own tummy without needing adult supervision.

He says it's homemade because it's made at home and the fact that it has been well received by his younger brothers, convinced him to pursue his dream of becoming #juniormasterchef.

Kids, be warned that the 30 minutes timer is to allow the soup to cool down before consumption.  In the words of the chef himself, “too hot will burn your mouth”. #singaporeanousewife #singaporeansiblingslametalk
