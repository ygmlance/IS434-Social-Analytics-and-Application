No circuit breaker blues for us when my kids are kept busy and entertained while we also get to bond through fun activities at home. Especially with my youngest girl Nykki who is still in preschool with My First Skool, the home-based learning resources that they provide are by far the best and new resources are added regularly. Such a boon for parents like myself!

Right now you can even register to go on a Live Centre Tour with the school's various centres this Covid-19 period. Read more on my latest blog entry at https://bit.ly/best-hbl-resources-preschool (link in bio) to see how you can clinch a $80 goodie bag and get a free tour + introduction to My First Skool!

Stay safe, stay active and keep learning this stay-home period everyone!
