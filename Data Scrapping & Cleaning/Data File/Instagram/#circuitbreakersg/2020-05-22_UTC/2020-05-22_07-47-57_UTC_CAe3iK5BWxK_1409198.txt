Did you know that Frankincense essential oil has been used in religious ceremonies for thousands of years in the Middle East?‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
YL distills their Frankincense oil from the resin of Boswellia carterii trees located in northern Africa, near the Arabian Peninsula. ‚Å£‚Å£

It‚Äôs my dream to visit that farm, one day! Frank is my absolute, absolute favourite and is one of the reasons that I decided to go for the #PremiumStarterKit. I mean, this oil alone, has a rather high price point so it makes getting the starter kit bundle all the more worth it. And, with the diffuser thrown in? Awesome savings!‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Anyway, I love Frank for its earthy, grounding aroma. But I don‚Äôt diffuse it (cause so sayang ü§≠). Instead, what I do is, I put a drop on my palms and inhale. The remaining oil on my palms, I rub it on the prayer mat area where we prostrate. A slight scent is more than enough for me.

You can also add it to your personal care products to promote a beautiful complexion and to help combat dry skin, but I haven‚Äôt been diligent in doing this. Maybe I should start again considering CB is ending soon and we‚Äôll be going out into civilisation.‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Btw, Frank is a key ingredient in YL‚Äôs Boswellia Wrinkle Cream, so that should tell you something!‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Have you tried Frank yet???
