🟥🟪Building Blocks🟧🟦

Having read about the benefits of open ended play, I couldn’t wait to introduce building blocks to J’s stash of toys. 🥰

Building blocks provide endless opportunities for creativity and imagination, and are suitable for children of every age! To start our collection, we bought a set from @plantoysofficial - we had received a gift a year back from this brand and it was good quality - sustainable wood, no sharp edges, smooth and easy to grasp for little hands. (Available online at @thebettertoystore)👍🏼

Since J has quite an extensive vocabulary for his age, he was able to direct the scene he wanted and contributed his ideas while I did most of the building. He did a little bit of stacking and placed the animal figurines while narrating his story to me. Swipe right to see his thought processes! 🌟

We also did other fun stuff like stacking blocks one above the other and practising counting, and J throwing a block to demolish the tower etc. Chaotic, but fun!

Skills developed: Creativity, hand-eye coordination, language, numeracy, colour and shape identification, finger control and psychomotor skills and many more!
