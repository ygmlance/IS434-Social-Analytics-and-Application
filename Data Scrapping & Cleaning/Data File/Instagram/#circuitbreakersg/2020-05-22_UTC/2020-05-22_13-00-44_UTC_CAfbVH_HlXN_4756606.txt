Day 46/56•Stayhome Dinner 
Didn't cook dinner and the rainy weather made us wana eat some spicy hot food 😁 so 佬M went to tabao Fish Head Curry set from a nearby zichar stall & we transferred the curry into @brunohotplatesg to keep warm as we eat it.
The set came with claypot tofu,  sambal kangkong & 3 portions of plain rice. Additional order of fried rice for Mini K so he could eat it with the tofu dish. ❤ .
Wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead! 👉 Catch my Live streaming tomorrow at 2pm!
