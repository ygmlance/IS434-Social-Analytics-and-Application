Came across this small church while wandering around Wengen, a small alpine town in Switzerland.

Looking at past travel photos makes me poignant, because it seems that leisure travel has really become a lost luxury for the foreseeable future.

Check out link in bio for my Switzerland Itinerary last year.

Do you miss travelling too?
