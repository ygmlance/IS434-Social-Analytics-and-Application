As the new normal sinks in and circuit breaker measures ease incrementally through June, you may be wondering, what comes next?⠀
⠀
We move on. It’s counterproductive to dwell on old times. The world has irrevocably and unexpectedly changed. I’m eager to see what the next three months bring, but it’s safe to say new opportunities will spring from a post-COVID world for years to come.⠀

Are you ready for the ride?⠀

Even as leaders preach pivoting from the pulpit of good business sense, it’s difficult to rewire practices and processes. We’re right there with you in your frustrations. Before COVID came and turned everything upside down, we were on the edge of a re-brand, putting aside some time every week to carve out a long-term strategy, covering everything from design and copy, to SEO and brand articulation. Although we’re still plugging away at the essential but slow change, the lockdown has led to an unexpected surge in website projects.⠀
⠀
We’re too busy to innovate. Businesses big and small are using this time away from the burn and bustle of the office to do something different. To become something bigger or better than their last iteration. We are humbled by our ability to provide meaningful support to each and every client in a world that has yet to find a new normal.⠀
⠀
Maybe seizing opportunities is the new normal?⠀
⠀
Are you ready for yours?
