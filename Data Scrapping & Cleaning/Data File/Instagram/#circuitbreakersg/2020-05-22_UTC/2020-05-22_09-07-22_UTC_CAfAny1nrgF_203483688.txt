Got a haircut this afternoon. Then got massively carried away in M&S buying nice things. Most ‘normal day’ in a while especially now I’m hanging around on my bike under shelter waiting for the rain to stop and avoiding going home.

I’m glad it’s a long weekend, this week has been really emotionally draining. Plenty of yummy things to hole up at home with now.. oven chips and crumpets.
Bonne weekend everybody. I’ve given up working out what day it is of #circuitbreakersg #singapore #marksandspencer #expathairstudio #expathairsg @expathairstudio
