Mee Jian kueh? Mee jiang kueh? Who knows the right spelling? I know it as “ban jian keh” hehe

It’s traditional snack - Asian peanut pancakes. 
It’s soft, fluffy and slightly thick pancake but it has a crispy and thin layer outside 😯 Usually the filling is peanut and sugar 😋 
Do you know where can you find a nice ban jian keh in Singapore? 🙂
