11 Days to "Safe Re-Opening"

Mask Up. Since the start of the Circuit Breaker, this is necessary when going out (except when exercising). Practise safe distancing, wash your hands, scan temperature, sanitise - This might continue to be the norm for months after CB ends.

Today is grocery shopping. I find going to the supermarket to stock up weekly necessities quite fun - an opportunity to be out and reduce cabin fever. The first time I went grocery shopping, it took me close to 2 hours to find the items on my list. Now, I am able to get in and out within 30mins if there's not much queue at the cashier.

ps. Today's strawberries at NTUC are bright red and sweet! *good things must share* üòÅ
