#CircuitBreakerSG || Look what the shut down of hair salons has done to him! I am joking, his hair has been quite crazy for a while now... like mine. 😕 Bought this onesie for him just 2 months back (although it feels like a long time ago) and he can fit into it now. Can't believe how much he has grown in a short span of time. #ian嘉乐
