The Circuit Breakers : a series dedicated to our front line superheroes

#5: Our supermarket, grocery stores and service crew workers. The other tanks. We take our supermarket trips like holidays but they're facing the hoards of crowds everyday. I remember a supermarket worker posting about how their hands hurt keying in items, bagging goods and clearing the goods left behind during the hoarding period. My sis-in-law works in a restaurant and her hands hurt too with the countless orders everyday... Thank you to you all!
