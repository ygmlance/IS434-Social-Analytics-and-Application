Tried on scrap pieces of watercolour paper given to me, so not quite sure what’s the weight of this cold pressed paper. The skies seems to be “spotted” with colours which I can’t quite figure out what gone wrong.
.
Then I tried to use the negative painting method after separating the skies from the land for those trees. I wanna try those pictures with a lot of pine trees next.
