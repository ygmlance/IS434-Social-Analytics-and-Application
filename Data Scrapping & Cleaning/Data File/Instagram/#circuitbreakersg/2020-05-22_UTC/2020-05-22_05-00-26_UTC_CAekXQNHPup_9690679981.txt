😱 Why need examples? For L3, “A” of course.👌⁣⁣
⁣⁣
👉 Say question asks “why there is a sharp decline in the luxury car market”. ⁣⁣
⁣
💭 What examples should you be using - cars similar to BMW and Mercedes, so that orange one is out. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
👉 What about this? “Discuss how these developments might affect the markets for cars and public transport.” ⁣⁣
⁣
💭 Should we segment the car market into mass market, luxury, sports cars, continental , Japanese, Korean cars, etc?⁣⁣
⁣⁣
👉 "Discuss whether housing is a normal or inferior good.” ⁣⁣
⁣
💭 SO is HDB an inferior good? ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
👉 How about using pizza and softdrinks for complements? OR chickens and ducks for competitive supply? 😲⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Examples also help us understand concepts better, because we can relate to our own experience. So what examples will you be arming yourselves now?⁣⁣
⁣⁣
