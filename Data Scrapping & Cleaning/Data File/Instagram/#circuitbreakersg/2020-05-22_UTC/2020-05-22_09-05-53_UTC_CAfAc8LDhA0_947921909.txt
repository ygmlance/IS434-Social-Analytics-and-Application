The scattered thunderstorms make me crave for Chicken Curry with Potatoes ðŸ¤¤ And growing up, I always looked forward to weekends or such rainy weather when mum will cook a big pot of Chinese-style chicken curry to feed the whole family. Those were the days and it bring back great memories as I savour mine with toasted bread.
