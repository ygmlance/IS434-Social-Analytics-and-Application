Two things I love to #dabao / #takeawayfood : SUSHI 🍣 and SALAD🥗 cos both are perishable/fresh ingredients heavy which is makes it more affordable to buy from store😂 ( salad veges are not cheap k! 💸)
...
I got the salad from nearby @crowncoffeesg and sushi from @coldstoragesg at @aperia.mall don’t underestimate  @coldstoragesg sushi, it’s like #sgcheap hacks - after 8pm got discount, if you lucky you can find the best assorted range with all the sushi u like and CHEAP👍harder now especially with high sushi cravings thanks to #circuitbreakersg 😢I got really lucky to get this $8.80 assorted sushi with my favorite sushis 🍀 💕- SWIPE TO SEE WALLPAPER WORTHY PHOTO OF SUSHI😍#foodphotography 😂)
...
I love @crowncoffeesg salads, it’s super worth it for the price ~$10 (25% off takeaway, free delivery within 5km) you get like a huge bowl full of fresh ingredients and must get their roasted pork belly! 4 huge clunks!🤩🐷 highly recommended ( I have them every other week when I was working around the area)🤭 so don’t have to go too far guys, give your neighbourhood a good walk/look 👀 and u might find great food choices along the way🥰
