Beautiful skin requires COMMITMENT, not a miracle.⁠
⁠
The skin around the eyes are the most delicate and thinnest, which is why #EyeCare is so important and we should always use the right products to treat targeted areas (not as simple as slapping on face products for the eye area!). We also advocate sticking to a regular skincare regime for the best and most optimum results.⁠
⁠
First signs of ageing are most often seen from the first wrinkle or lines around the eye area. So use a good eye cream that helps you target specific concerns. In this case, @skinceuticals_sg 's A.G.E Eye Complex is one eye cream you would want to have in your skincare line-up. This three-dimensional, anti-wrinkle eye cream not only helps in (1) Reducing dark circles, (2) Puffiness, and (3) Crow's feet ; it also helps in skin firmness, elasticity and improve the effects of Glycation (attachment of a sugar to a protein or lipid) around the eye, while hydrating skin!⁠ Psst: Avoid using any eye cream at night as it could lead to puffiness!

No excuses not to care for your skin during this #circuitbreaker ! ;)⁠
