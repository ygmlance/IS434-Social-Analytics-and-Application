Baked these chips using chia seeds, quinoa, polenta and sesame seeds, a little flavoring like lemon, salt was added as well. Adding tbsp of water bit by bit to make the mixture come together. ⁣
I milled the chia seeds and quinoa in my Thermomix first to get a finer texture for about 15 seconds and mix all ingredients in about 6 seconds. ⁣
⁣
Roll them out and bake at 200DC for about 10mins.⁣
⁣
Tried out guacamole and pumpkin hummus recipe from Thermomix programmed recipes as well and it’s indeed delicious! ⁣
