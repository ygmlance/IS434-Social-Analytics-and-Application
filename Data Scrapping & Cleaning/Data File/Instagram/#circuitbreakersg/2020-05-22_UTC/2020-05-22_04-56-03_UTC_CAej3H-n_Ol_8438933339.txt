This is my BEST Buy especially this circuit breaker. 
It is not easy for an adult to put on their mask for the whole day and how can it be easier for our children when they start school and gotta wear mask throughout the whole day? 
I'm super glad that we managed to get these for the children and since they choose the designs themselves, they were more than willing to wear it (THANK GOODNESS!!!) #stayathome #stayhomeforSG #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakerSG #fortheLoveofKids #familybondingtime #LoveWhatMatters #MiracleLife #familytime #gefa
