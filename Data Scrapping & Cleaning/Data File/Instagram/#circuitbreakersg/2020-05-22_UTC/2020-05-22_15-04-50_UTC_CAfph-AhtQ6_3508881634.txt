Today the most amazing muffins landed on my doorstep (literally) as my grand master of baking best friend @sashum decided to wield her magical and powerful spatula to bless me with her prowess! ‚Å£
‚Å£
She new I was craving the muffins we use to have at our university library at Curtin where while she mugged for exams and I doodling on my notes and flipping NW gossip magazines haha! ‚Å£
‚Å£
These are THE BEST MUFFINS I WILL EVER HAVE IN MY LIFE HANDS DOWN! ‚Å£
