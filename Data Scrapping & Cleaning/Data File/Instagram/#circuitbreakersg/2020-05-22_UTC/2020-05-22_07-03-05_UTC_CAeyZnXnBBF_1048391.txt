Happy First Birthday to our twin darlings! The year passes so fast, it has been hard but yet so rewarding. And I sometimes look at them and am still in disbelief that we have two! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We celebrated their birthday on 5 May at home, as is the norm now. It was their first celebration of any kind, no full month and no 100th day. Planned for a party finally to introduce them to our friends but life has other plans. So it is just us at home, video calls with our families and loads of photos and videos to mark the occasion. So excuse me for the onslaught of posts from their first birthday. .
