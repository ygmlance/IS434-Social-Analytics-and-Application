Blessed Friday. Just a note that tomorrow will be the last day of Ramadan. So to my non Muslim friends, do know that your Muslim friends last day of fasting is tomorrow. Sunday is Eid. I just spoke to mum and once again she made me feel better. What would I do without mum? Rezeki itu dari siapa Amy? Anyway.... today - The battle to trim Felix nails. Only managed to trim his right front paw. He didnâ€™t allow me to cut the rest and we both had a battle of words. Growling and talking stern with each other. I ended up opening my room door telling him to get out of which he did and hid below the seater staring at me angrily. It may seem like Iâ€™m a bad mum who failed at managing her son. I admit I am. A failure parenting him.  Itâ€™s better now. Heâ€™s just sleeping at his corner giving me a â€˜I hope you are aware how much you disappoint meâ€™ look. .

Felix is a battle. He is one of the most demanding cat Iâ€™ve had with an attitude that matches mine. Maybe thatâ€™s why god entrust him to me. I love him truly and now I have to cut his nails when heâ€™s sound asleep but then.... Does Felix sleeps soundly? Heâ€™s like me... ðŸ˜’ One day he will understand how much I truly love him and give me the affection as much as Fluffy does for me. For now, Iâ€™ll just be content with what he gives.
