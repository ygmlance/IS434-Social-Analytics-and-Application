Found this gorgeous sustainable luxe brand and was so excited to shoot and share these. But then I though why just shoot when I could try my hand at a style video. One of my New Years Resolutions was to do more video work so here goes. And since it’s still January… wait, what?! It’s the end of May? When did that happen? Oh…right. Anyway here are four looks from @su_by_hand made with the most luscious silks colored with plant dyes.
