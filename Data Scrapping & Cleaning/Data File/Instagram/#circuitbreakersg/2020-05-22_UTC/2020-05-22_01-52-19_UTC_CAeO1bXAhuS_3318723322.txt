Cycling has taken the world by storm, more so in recent months with the pandemic where everyone is trying to stay healthy and stay sane. Today we are proud to showcase the Specialized Diverge. Itâ€™s such a fun bike where you can do some dirt as well as road riding altogether! A nice option when you have kids to ride with on pavement and grass, or when you want to join friends for a socially distanced ride!
