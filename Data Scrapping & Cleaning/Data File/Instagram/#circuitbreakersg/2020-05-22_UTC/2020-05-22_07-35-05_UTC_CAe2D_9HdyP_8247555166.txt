Homemade red dragonfruit soufflé pancakes! 🥞
✨
Made the pancakes with recipe from @honeybeesweets.sg. The beautiful colour caught my attention when I saw this from her IG. What’s more it’s all natural! It’s like an upgraded version of the normal soufflé pancakes, though I actually like both. The colour of this is just too pretty to resist 😂. I reduced the sugar a little and find the sweetness level to be just right even without dipping in any syrup. They’re good even on its own! Thanks @honeybeesweets.sg for sharing! 😊
