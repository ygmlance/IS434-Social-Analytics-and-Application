Things to do with the kids #63

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Oh, Vanilla, just look at my gorgeous whiskers." "Titus, you look like an arrogant walrus" "Vanilla, that was rude." "But, you do. I mean, they're so long and walrus-like." "Are you saying I'm a walrus now?" "I beg your pardon?" "Any excuse to have a go at me about my backside. You know I have #foodissues  with this #workingfromhome thing. Well, I've noticed you're getting a bit tubby yourself." "Titus, go and brush your whiskers." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
