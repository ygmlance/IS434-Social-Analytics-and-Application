“I’ve worked many jobs since I was a young working adult. I was a business owner - that was a challenging experience. I've also worked as a manager overseeing production at a local bakery chain. It was difficult when I shifted jobs - having to pick up so many new skills in a short amount of time with little margin for error. We have to learn and adapt, right? And I did it so that I could help support my family and children together with my husband.⠀
⠀
To me, life is about learning, improving, and continuously moving forward. Even now when I’m older, I still believe in this. I tell my children: life doesn't stop for you just because you don’t know how to face it, you’ve got to learn to keep up.⠀
⠀
Since the circuit breaker started, I’ve been stuck at home, unable to meet my kids and grandchildren. I have to wait 55 days before I can see them again! That’s the longest I’ve ever gone without seeing their faces. I’m sure all the parents out there understand: no mother or grandmother would want to go so long without seeing their children.⠀
⠀
So what do I do? I learned and adapted again. I heard about applications letting you make video calls to people so that you can see them face-to-face. I’m not very good with technology, so I thought that learning how to use these apps was going to be a challenge, but it turned out much easier than I expected.⠀
⠀
In fact, I even went on to teach my friends how to use these functions and now we get to talk to each other in these big chat groups together! I guess I could say I’ve transformed from being not very tech savvy, to become a tech "ambassador" in these few weeks.⠀
⠀
Now I get to see my kids and grandchildren whenever I want, even after this circuit breaker has been lifted. I guess it goes to show my point: Learning is a lifelong pursuit, regardless of how old you are. You’ve got to keep moving forward for yourself, and for those that you love.⠀
⠀
I choose to power progress.”⠀
