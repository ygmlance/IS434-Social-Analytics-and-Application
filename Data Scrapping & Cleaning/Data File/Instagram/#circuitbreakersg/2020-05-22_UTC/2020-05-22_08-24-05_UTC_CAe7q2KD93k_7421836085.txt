Today we will look at Indirect Resource, also known as 偏印. People with a high percentage of Indirect Resource have a unique way of seeing things. They are good at doing back end work, like strategic planning and research.  They also have a particular interest in non-conventional knowledge like Feng Shui and Bazi. They have a powerful sixth sense and can foresee things before they happen. Ability to adapt to a new environment fast is one of their strong points. 
They might be unrealistic for some people because of their unique idea and foresight. As a result, they prefer living in their own world until someone that see eye to eye with their ideas come around. They will need to work on communication with others and accept that life still need to go on non-matter whether someone sees eye to eye with you or not and understand that being in a team player working together is equally important. 
The career that is suitable for people with high 偏印 percentage is Astrologer, Researcher, Strategic Planning, Customer Service, Software Developer, Graphic Designer.
