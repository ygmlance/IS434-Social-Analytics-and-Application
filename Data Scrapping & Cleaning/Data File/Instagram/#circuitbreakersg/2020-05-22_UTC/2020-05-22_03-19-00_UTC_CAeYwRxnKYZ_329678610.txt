Stay home activity of the day with my little avid baker was this easy-to-follow Kitty Cheese Tart baking kit ($38), a collaboration between @littlemissbento @bakerisingapore .
.
Delivery was the next day. Most of the ingredients were all included and numbered, except for the eggs. Hence no wastage at all. So be good, follow the step-by-step instructions on the recipe card .

Result: Delicious mouthwatering Lemon Cheese tarts and a good bonding session with your child
.
Itâ€™s really easy peasy. .
