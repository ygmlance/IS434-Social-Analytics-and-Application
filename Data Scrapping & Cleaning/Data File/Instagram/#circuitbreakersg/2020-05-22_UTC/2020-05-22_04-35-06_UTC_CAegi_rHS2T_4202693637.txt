A Sneak peek into what I do daily after work since the #circuitbreakersg started. Last year, my team and I worked on this prototype #sportsbra design @drtwlbiomaterials amidst other projectsâ€”where we infused a breathable stretchy fabric with anti-bacterial, anti-viral and antifungal copper ions. The idea was to minimise irritation from these skin infections common in those who sweat a lot in humid Singapore. Do you want to get your hands on this line? Let us know on DM!
