Parents 👪 👪 👪, you can also participate by sending us a photo 🖼 of a bath product 🧴 🧼 that your kids use. We will break down the ingredient list 📝 and examine🔎 if they are toxins☠ or irritants. We will teach you to read ingredient lists of children cleansing products to empower 💪 you to make better and healthier choices for your family.
