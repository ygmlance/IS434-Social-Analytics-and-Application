Sim Lim Square. Normally full of people and open shops.

You will usually not have a dull moment if you shop here.

As the Circuit Breaker measures continue, you really see the toll it takes on business in terms of the velocity of money. 
Yikes man! Hopefully the vibrancy of the economy will resume as we move back to the new normal.
