Dinner this evening, was a bowl of steamed rice, some stir-fried Garlic Stems, and Gong Bao Meatballs! The Gong Bao sauce was made by frying dried chillies and Sichuan Peppercorns until fragrant, and then throwing in minced garlic, sliced ginger and spring onion sticks and frying these until fragrant too. The already fried meatballs were then thrown in and tossed together with the spices, and a sauce of superior light and dark soya sauces, sugar, Chinkiang Vinegar, Shaoxing wine and sesame sauce was added into the wok, which was tossed again to coat the meatballs. Tasty and satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #stirfriedgarlicstems #gongbaomeatballs #szechwansauce #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
