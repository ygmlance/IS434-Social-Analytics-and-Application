5월 MAY >> Being happy is my goal, but greatness is my mission ✨ 
I’m nowhere near but I’ll get there before I turn 32. How’s your May been? May has been pretty amazing other than work working out baking & cooking; my friends and I put in our best efforts to be there for a lovely friend’s birthday during this lockdown 💕
But May 2020 also reminded me that I’m still nowhere near where I want to be and I’ve not been the best Sandy that I can be, for anyone, basically. While everyone’s been sending love to their friends and family during this season, I found myself focusing more on what makes me happy. I mean, that might not be wrong but I know I’ve changed because I used to be all about everyone else but myself. Turning 30 has changed many of my perspectives, and I’m embracing it. I’m thankful for Circuit Breaker because it gives me time to reflect. 
Have a lovely last week of May everyone :) #enjoying #circuitbreakersg #quarantinelife #itonlygetsbetter
