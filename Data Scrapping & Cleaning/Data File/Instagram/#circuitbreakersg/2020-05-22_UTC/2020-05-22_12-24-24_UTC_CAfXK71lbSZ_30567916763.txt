It’s rest (from cooking) day Friday! 🥳

Been craving Thai food so we ordered some from Un-Yang-Kor-Dai @uykdsg 
1️⃣ Tom yum with fresh prawns 
2️⃣ Thai-style fried chicken wings 
3️⃣ Crispy pork belly with special dipping sauce
4️⃣ Morning glory stir fry with garlic 
5️⃣ Phad Thai veggie 
We enjoyed all the dishes and I particularly like: .
.
🌟 The crispy pork - it was yummy and the skin was still crispy when it arrived. 👍🏻 .
.
🌟 The morning glory was surprising impressive as it was really fragrant and flavourful. 😋 .
.
.
Haven’t had such quality Thai food in a while. Will definitely be ordering from them again. 😊

We ordered the food in the afternoon before the heavy downpour started and I was worried when it started raining that the food would arrive late. However, the food actually arrived on time despite the heavy rain. And for that I’m grateful to the delivery person who braved the 🌧 🌧 to send our dinner today. #gratitudediary
