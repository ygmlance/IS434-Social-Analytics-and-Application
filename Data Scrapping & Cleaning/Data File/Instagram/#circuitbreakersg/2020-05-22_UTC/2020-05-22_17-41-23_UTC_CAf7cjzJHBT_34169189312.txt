To make this Szechuan vegetable soup, cut some Szechuan vegetable into thin strips and soak them in a bowl of water for couple hours. Next, throw all ingredients into a pot (Szechuan vegetable, chinese cabbage, corn, tomatoes, carrots, button mushroom, tofu and three slices of ginger). Simmer for an hour and lunch is ready! 🙌🏻
