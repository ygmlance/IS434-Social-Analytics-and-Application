“During this time of turmoil, the Majulah Movement brings much hope and comfort to its beneficiaries and partners. It’s a real honor to be given the opportunity to help the various communities. In only 2 weeks, we’ve had immense support and it really is only the beginning. Whatever the new normal and future holds, I am certain that Majulah Movement will be there and we will continue to be of service” - Helen Clare Rozario - @helcroz
