Stay home workouts. We started #CircuitBreakerSG on the 7 Apr, & I've been taking @geniemule 's lead with the workouts daily. Its amazing what the body can adapt to, to date I think we've only had a total of 4 to 5 days spreadout of a break. And I'm proud of myself that I've come this far. I also became stronger with my runs, still on the 21km gold Coast training program that Eug prepped for me though the race isn't happening anymore.

So what have you achieved in this period of #CircuitBreakerSG? A question posed to us recently during a birthday Zoom call. A good one to ponder on for sure. In the bigger scheme of things, what are you achieving in your life now?
