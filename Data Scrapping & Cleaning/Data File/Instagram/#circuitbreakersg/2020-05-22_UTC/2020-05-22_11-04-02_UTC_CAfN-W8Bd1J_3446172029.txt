Itâ€™s been a bit quiet over here as Iâ€™ve been spring cleaning in preparation for Hari Raya! But guess what I found: a notebook alllll the way from 1998 with these pieces of yuzen chiyogami paper properly cut and pasted because I really adored how pretty they were ðŸ˜Š I guess I can really trace back my love of pretty paper all the way since my childhood days, and thatâ€™s kinda cool that Iâ€™ve made it into my business today ðŸ¥° happy Friday and Day 46 everyone! #circuitbreakersg #origamipaper #hariraya2020
