ðŸ’› NO NEED TO STRESS AND TRY TOO HARD when it comes to kids activities ðŸ’›
.
Many moms have asked about what activities to do to keep kids engaged whether in #circuitbreakersg or otherwise. In my opinion, you don't have to really scratch your head OR take it too seriously to the level where you start blaming your lack of creativity when it comes to kids activities.
.
Here are some SIMPLE and TRIED n TESTED tips from me:
.
ðŸš¸ Give some papers, color pens and kid-safe-scissors to your kid. Definitely, they will come up with their own master piece. Boat, Doll, Car, Family and the list is endless...
.
ðŸš¸ Give them a big glass of water, 2-3 utensils of different sizes and 2-3 spoons and watch the fun. They'll fill up the utensils, pour them, spill water and while doing all this will learn measurements naturally.
.
ðŸš¸  Give them a drawing block and a paintbrush and some water colors. Their inner #picasso is sure to be unleashed! They will mix all colors and thereby learn color names, color cycle and so on.
.
ðŸš¸ Give them some flour, oil and water. Messy Dough is ready and their motor skills are getting polished meanwhile.
.
ðŸš¸ Give them a few of old toys and water. Let them wash their toys while rekindling the love for their toys.
.
ðŸš¸ Give them a scooter, one carton, a few toys and they are delivery guys. They feel responsible and take their job very seriously.
.
ðŸš¸ Give them a slime recipe and contents. They know how to DIY their own slime.
.
ðŸš¸ Give them a few green beans, soil, old container and let them learn planting and plant life cycle.
.
ðŸš¸ Lego - one set and thousands of creations. Shrihaan is a #legofanatic and always ready to play with #lego .
.
Please add more tips and I will be happy to include them in my #igstories ðŸ’›
