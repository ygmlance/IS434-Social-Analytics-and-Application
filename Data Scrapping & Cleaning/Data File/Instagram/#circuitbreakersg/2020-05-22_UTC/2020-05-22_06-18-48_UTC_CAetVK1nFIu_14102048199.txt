Woot! The kids' books from @bookdepository finally arrived during lunchtime today, delivered by the quietest postman I've ever met, it has to be said (he must have stood at our door for minutes before I noticed him)! Love this free bookmark - it really cracks me up! The very hungry Caterpillar given the typical Hollywood spin, haha!

My son really seemed to enjoy reading The 13-Story Treehouse and has almost got to the end of the book. Slooooooow doooooown! There are another 17 days to go before school reopens for him!
