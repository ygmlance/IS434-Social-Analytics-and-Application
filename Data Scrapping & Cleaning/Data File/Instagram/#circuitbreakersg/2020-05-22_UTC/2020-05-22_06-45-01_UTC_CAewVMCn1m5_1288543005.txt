They have not step out of the house  since #circuitbreaker started. They have not been wearing mask except that few days when they went to school b4 CB.
.
With school reopening next month and the need to wear mask in school, I am trying to let them wear during play time so they can get use to it slowly.
.
#CharleneNg managed to wear for 10mins on 1st time and improving to 30mins on 2nd time. Whereas #CandiceNg still going strong, only removed while having lunch.
.
I realised the kids tend to wear longer if the mask is of their favourite prints or design. ðŸ¤­
