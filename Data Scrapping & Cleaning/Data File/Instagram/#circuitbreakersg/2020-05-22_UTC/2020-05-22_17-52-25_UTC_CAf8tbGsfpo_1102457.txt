#CircuitBreakerSg Day 46! Cooked some of my favourite dishes for dinner:

1. Miso salmon belly ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ - salmon belly from #9sseafood, marinated with miso sauce. Recipe adapted from #justonecookbook, airfried using my new #NinjaAirFryer at 190C for about 10-15 mins or till nicely charred. You can now get the AF160 at 40% off cart with my code <wensdelight> at www.ninjakitchen.sg!

2. Stir fry sliced ribeye with broccoli and capsicum! ðŸ˜‹

3. Cabbage egg soup, simple and comforting!

Stay safe and healthy! Have a wonderful long weekend everyone!
