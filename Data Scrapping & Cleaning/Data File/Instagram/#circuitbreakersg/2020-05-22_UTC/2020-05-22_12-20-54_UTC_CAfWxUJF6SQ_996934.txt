#circuitbreakerday46 // On mandatory leave for the rest of May, as the Japanese Company seeks to cut costs. Already, I’m eating enough to put back all the weight I’ve lost in overworking during #circuitbreakersg so far. .
After a real bit of hard work in the garden, this #purplewheatsourdough from @thebakehaus.sg was really good with #homecooked #ayambuahkeluak x #achar x #sambalbelacan. No one knows where the coasters went, so we had to use some #ferncuttings instead. .
They look very much like how I’d imagined fig leaves as a kid - that insubstantial covering Adam and Eve made for themselves in an attempt to hide shame at their own sin (Genesis 3:7).
.
That bit during #unionschooloftheology’s #summerschool2020 about the #biblicaltheology of clothing was very intriguing.
.
• After pronouncing judgment on Adam and Eve and the rest of creation, “the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them” (Genesis 3:21) - animals were sacrificed to cover their shame.
.
• Later, Jacob inherits the promises by deceiving his dad, clothed in the garments of the firstborn son (Genesis 27).
.
• Fast forward to the present: all of us are dressed like slum-dwellers. Our most “righteous” Mother Teresa deeds, that we pat ourselves on the back for, are just like filthy rags to God (Isaiah 64:6).
.
• But the absolutely #goodnews is that, Christians, like Jacob, are clothed in garments not our own. We are clothed in Christ (Galatians 3:27). The ultimate #impostersyndrome, except with the express permission (and even intention) of the original owner of the garments:
- we are clothed with his garments of salvation and robes of righteousness (Isaiah 61:10) - no Christian earned any of that, but are given his white garments to wear so that our shameful nakedness is not exposed to God’s judgement (Revelation 3:18);
- so now we are urged to “to take off our old self, which is...corrupt and to... put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness (Ephesians 4:22-24); and - we look forward to being clothed in Jesus’ immortality (1 Cor 15:53) though we deserve only mortality and death.
