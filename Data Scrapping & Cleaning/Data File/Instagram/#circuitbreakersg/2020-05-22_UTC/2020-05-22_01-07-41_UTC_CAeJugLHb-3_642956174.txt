[ Permanent closure of Tiong Bahru Outlet]

COVID-19 has hit us pretty badly, and we all know the road to recovery from this pandemic is going to be a long one.

With a heavy heart, we have made the difficult decision to close our Tiong Bahru outlet permanently, so we can consolidate our resources to run our remaining four outlets. ( If you don't know yet, Yoga Inc is run by a single owner and she doesn't have a rich father. ‚òπÔ∏è) We are sorry to have to do this, and apologise particularly to all of our TB members. Thank you for having been with us the last four years, and we hope that you will be able to continue your practice with us at any of our other 4 outlets, the nearest one being Buona Vista. ( Hopefully we can resume business without too much restrictions in July lah...ü§ûüèª)
