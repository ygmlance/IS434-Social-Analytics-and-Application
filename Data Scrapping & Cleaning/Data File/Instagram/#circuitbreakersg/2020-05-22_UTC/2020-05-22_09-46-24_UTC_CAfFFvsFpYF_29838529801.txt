Sadly we need to let go one of our studios due to the neverending waiting of covid19...we had so many memories here, countless sleepless nights, new choreographies, reheasals, practices....as our company has no income since the shut down of entertainment industry even before circuit breaker. We can't afford to pay for the empty studio until phase 3 of CB.
 Really hope that economies will revive by the end of 2020 and companies like ours will be able to thrive again!
