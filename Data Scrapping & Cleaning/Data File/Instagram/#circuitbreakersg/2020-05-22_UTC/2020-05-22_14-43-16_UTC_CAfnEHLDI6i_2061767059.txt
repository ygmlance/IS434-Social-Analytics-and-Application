Today is Day 46 of the Circuit Breaker and soon, we can move out slowly and cautiously. Will life be the same again? At least not till a vaccine for Covid-19 is found or at least till the end of the year.

The early part of the CB days, I heard loud thunder & saw lightning flashes c/w heavy downpour. My Circuit Breaker trips on 30 April (Day 24) after one such heavy downpour. 
At the end Day 2 of the CB, we only had a respectable 142 cases and now we hit 30k, 30,426 cases to be exact. But does the number really matters? 
Like age, it is just a number. What is important is that the many dormitories clusters are under control. Just like our age, does it matters how old we are? Or what truly matters is the quality of life we have.  #covid_19 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
