Super excited about this new range of embroidery arriving next week ( if everything goes according to plan!🤞🏼🤞🏼) Embroidery styles are risky because the costs of sampling is always higher than just the usual cut & see, and if stitching is done in a hurry, the threads can cause the fabric to pucker (crinkle), but if there’s not enough tension applied, the embroidery will be too loose & the over pattern lost! Anyways, we fiddled with this 2 styles a lot but finally decided to go ahead with one blouse & 2 loose dresses ( in white & navy). Perfect accompaniment for that dream beach holiday that we’re definitely taking - eventually when this pandemic is defeated! Jiayou everybody! Enjoy the weekend! 🥂💖🏖🌈
