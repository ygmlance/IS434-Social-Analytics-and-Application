We had a reprise of the #beefwellington (with Foie Gras, side of sautÃ©ed mushroom and spinach) from @barroquegrill for a Virtual party last night! See my very first post for a better pic. Maybe it's my imagination but it seemed even better this time, perfectly medium rare with delectable jus ðŸ˜‹. We also had apple pie (#tarttartin, 2nd pic) for dessert, and their house wine. Food was hand-delivered by the chef as we live nearby. Very much appreciated!
