Yesterday project: Taiwanese Castella Cupcake.

Running out of baking paper for the baking tin so we made cupcake instead.

She helped out and insisted me to take photos/videos of her so she can show to her friend😂 [Recipe]
Taiwanese Castella Cake 台湾古早味蛋糕 
INGREDIENTS: • 3 Eggs
• 50g Cake flour • 50g Sugar • 50g Milk • 50g Butter
• Vanilla essence (optional)

DIRECTIONS: • Separate eggs whites and egg yolks
• Sift the cake flour
• Pour the milk and butter into pot and boil with medium heat fire
• Pour the butter mixture into flour while it's still hot and mixed it
• Pour the egg yolks and vanilla essence while stirring, till it's mixed evenly
• Whisk the egg whites, and slowly add sugar till it looks fluffy
• Add 1/3 of the meringue (egg whites) into flour mixture and mixed it well
• Add the rest of egg white into flour mixture and mixed it well • Wrap baking tin with cling wrap and aluminum foil to prevent water enters
• Line baking tin with a layer of Baking paper before pouring in the mixture (as the cake need to bake with water bath)
• Lightly bang the baking tin on table to remove air bubbles
• Pop into preheated oven at 150C, bake for 60 minutes (or until fully cooked)

Read that bang the cake tin few times after it's cooked, can prevent the cake from shrinking.
