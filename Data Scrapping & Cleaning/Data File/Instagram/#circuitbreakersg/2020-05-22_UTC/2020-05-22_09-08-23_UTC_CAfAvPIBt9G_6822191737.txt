Last 2 days of Ramadan. .
.
Only 2 more Iftars. The month has gone by so quickly. Even though my wife is a fantastic cook and makes some of the most mouth watering Singaporean Malay dishes, I do miss the Iftars and the Ramadan atmosphere back in Bosnia. .
.
My mum's home cooked meals, the sound of the cannon signaling the end of another days fast and the call to Maghrib prayer echoing around the city of Sarajevo. Setting up the dining room table and the whole family getting together to eat.

What are you having for Iftar tonight?
