This month can be measured in firsts and lasts.
.
Final night of Ramadan. Final night for tarawih prayers. Final sahur tmr morning.
.
First time our family did tarawih on all the nights that we could. First time the girls felt comfortable to lead prayers. (Dad excused himself & watched.)
.
First time we showed love by being frequent coordinators & deliverers of food to extended family.
.
First time we spent Ramadan at home together 24/7 (& survived.)
.
First time my 71 yo dad sent us an eRaya card.ðŸ˜‚ And we didnâ€™t know how he learned this.
.
In case youâ€™re wondering, this is not a recent photo. But it was our first wefie together in hijab. (Between my cousin & me, itâ€™s pretty clear who the angel is. Not me.) Another first.
