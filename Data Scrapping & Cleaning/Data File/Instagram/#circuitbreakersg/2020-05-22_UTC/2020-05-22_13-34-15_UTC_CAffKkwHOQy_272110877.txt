Day 44. Woke up to an overcast morning sky. A storm is definitely brewing. Missy asked abt how crystal dumplings come about. So we rushed to the supermarket to get all ingredients for the project. Googled for recipe and discovered the different types of starch - potato, tapioca, corn, wheat and their functions. In the end, we made 20 savory and 15 sweet potato paste crystal dumplings (水晶包) Quite a fruitful day for us. The cool weather was perfect for spending time in the kitchen. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #crystaldumplings #homemade #潮州水晶包 #instadaily
