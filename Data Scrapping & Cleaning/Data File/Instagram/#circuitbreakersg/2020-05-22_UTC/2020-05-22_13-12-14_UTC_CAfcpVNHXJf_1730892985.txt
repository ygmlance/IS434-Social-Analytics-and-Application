Throwback to @gardensbythebay â€˜s last floral exhibition ðŸŒ¸

This was taken on 15 March â€˜20, about 3 weeks before the circuit breaker period started. There was already a limit imposed on the number of visitors allowed into the domes. Almost half of the people we saw already donned on ðŸ˜·, things still seemed very normal. Fast-forward 2+ months later, weâ€™re more or less accustomed to the new norm. 
Freedom is and has always been such a luxury. Side note, I havenâ€™t been to the Floral Fantasy yet and would love to visit when things are looking better!
