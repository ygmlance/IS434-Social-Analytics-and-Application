👭👫👬The world would be a much better place if everyone smiled more. So smile, be cheerful. 👬👫👭 😀😃😄😁😆😊☺️🙂😉😌🥰😚😚😛😝😜🤪🤓😎🤩🥳 wow! There are so many smiling emoticons to use. So just use them generously! There’s much to cheer about today! Me and my colleagues are so excited because the company is holding a virtual home-party this afternoon from 4-6pm! It’s gonna be a real online party with Emcees, lucky draw and games🥳🥳🥳 The Fun Committee has even organized for party packs to be delivered to us at home. Some have received and I’m still waiting for mine. Quite a big pack with lots of titbits, crackers and drinks! I’m excited and curious how the party is gonna be! Do we need to show our faces? Mmmm luckily I already washed my hair last night. 😆 So, no foodart today because I need to squeeze in many stuff to do before the party starts at 4pm and that include baking a cake and finishing my emails! Nevertheless, I still try to plate my breakfast nicely consisting of Campbell cream of chicken soup with sliced hotdog, dipping Hello Kitty bread, Oreo cookies and dried fruits snack; all paired with honey drink! 😋TGIF everyone! 🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳
