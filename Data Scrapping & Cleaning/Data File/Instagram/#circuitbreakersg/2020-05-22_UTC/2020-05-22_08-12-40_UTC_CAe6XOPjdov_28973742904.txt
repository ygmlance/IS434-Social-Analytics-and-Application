Friday is the day where I usually have bits of  leftover ingredients from the week. Sliced up some leftover veggies to prepare the usual stir-fried vermicelli for lunch. Not until I found some hae bee hiam stashed somewhere in the fridge and decided to mix some into the dish. OMG! It was so delish!
.
For the uninitiated, hae bee hiam, also known as spicy dried shrimp sambal, is a spicy Asian condiment which you can have it with anything. From your usual stir-fried morning glory, steamed yam cake or simply spread it on slices of bread to make an Asian sandwich. But today, Iâ€™ve discovered another way to enjoy it. Will share my hae bee hiam recipe soon. ðŸ˜‰
