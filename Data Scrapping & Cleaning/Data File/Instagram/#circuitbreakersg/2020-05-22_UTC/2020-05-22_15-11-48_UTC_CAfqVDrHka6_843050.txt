*Cheese & Chives Scones*

Since dinner was prepared early, I decided to have my 2nd baking adventure! Iâ€™ve been craving for scones this #circuitbreakersg and Iâ€™ve had to hunt down some scones and clotted cream some weeks ago. I browsed recipes on YouTube recently and surmised that I should be able to pull this one off. 
Though the scones didnâ€™t rise higher as I think it should, it still tastes great! My whole house was also filled with a buttery cheesy fragrance it never had. 
Guess Iâ€™ve been bitten by the baking bug! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ .
