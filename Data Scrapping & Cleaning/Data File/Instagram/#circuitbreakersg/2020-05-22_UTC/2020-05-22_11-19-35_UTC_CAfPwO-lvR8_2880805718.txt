Parrotdog Bitterbitch IPA and Rifleman XPA 🇳🇿🍺
⁣
The bottle caps say it all. Both of these hop-forward brews are really 𝗡𝗶𝗰𝗲. Don't be put off by their names - the Bitterbitch is really not that bitter, at least not in a bad way; and the Rifleman is actually named after a small bird rather than some menacing gunslinger.
⁣
These beers are bright, hoppy exemplars of New World brewing, and do great credit to the NZ craft beer scene! ⁣
