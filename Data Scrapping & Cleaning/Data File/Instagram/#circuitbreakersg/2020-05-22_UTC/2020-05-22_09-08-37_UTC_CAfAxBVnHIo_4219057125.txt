Baked an orange chiffon cake for my grandparents' prayers offering tomorrow. Got a shortie from leftover batter. This is a light and fluffy orange chiffon cake with orange peel and reduced sugar. üçä

In other news, as an attempt to be more environmentally friendly, I bought a reusable cake carrier so that I can bake more frequently for grandparents and not use so many disposable cake containers.
