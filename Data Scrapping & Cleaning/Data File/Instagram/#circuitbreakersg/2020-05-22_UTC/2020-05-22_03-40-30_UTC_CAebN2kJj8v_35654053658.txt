Breakfast from one of the best croissants in town @tiongbahrubakery and very fortunate to have a couple of outlets within 10mins drive to kick start the day! Not to forget our survival kit for morning starter - Freshly brewed latte from our Creatista Plus @nespresso.sg 
Ps: I'm not against food delivery but i thought by buying directly from the businesses would translate to 100% sales receipt for them.
