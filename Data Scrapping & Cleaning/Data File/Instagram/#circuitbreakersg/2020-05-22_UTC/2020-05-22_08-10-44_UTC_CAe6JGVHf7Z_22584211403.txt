Toasted buns with Pandan Kaya & butter... love it!!!!
⁣
Managed to grab a bunch of pandan leaves 2 days ago and started to make plans for what to cook or bake the next few days. ⁣
⁣
I baked the pandan buns yesterday night but unfortunately the green does not show, but the fragrance is enough to kill. I used the Windsor bread recipe and replace part of the water with milk & pandan juice⁣
⁣
Today using the Philips Pressure Cooker and in few minutes my pandan kaya is done. ⁣
⁣
Easy recipe to share ⁣
*About 200ml of coconut milk blend with a few pandan leaves, squeeze out the liquid.⁣
*3 egg yolks (I use yolks from 60gm eggs)⁣
*85gm sugar ⁣(mildly sweet, add more sugar if needed)
**Stir all ingredients together using 'low saute' mode for about 5-7 minutes till the kaya thickens⁣
***Cool & eat !!!⁣
⁣
The perfect match for my afternoon tea !!! ⁣
