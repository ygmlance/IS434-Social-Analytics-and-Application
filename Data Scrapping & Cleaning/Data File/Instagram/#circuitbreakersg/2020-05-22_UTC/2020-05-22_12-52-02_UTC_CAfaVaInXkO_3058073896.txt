I am truly blessed that in my last weekend to enjoy raw and unpasteurised food for a while to come, the sweetest Anil @riardsg saw to it that the best kind of care package came my way - a delivery from Lolla @lollasg. This special delivery included something I've been wanting to try out for the longest time: Lolla's signature Sea Urchin Pudding!! While the entire spread was delectable, indulge me as I aim the spotlight on the pudding.
.
Lolla's superstar is an umami bomb. The creamy pudding is liberally blackened with squid ink, and combined with egg yolks, cream and tomato juice for a wonderful savoury hit that endears itself so lovingly to the mineral qualities of the gold slivers of sea urchin. Each mouthful is a burst of the ocean, with a teensy touch of unexpected sweetness from the sea urchin to delicately balance the flavours. A drizzle of the chives and chive oil beautifully rounds up each decadent spoonful.
.
The Sea Urchin Pudding can be conveniently enjoyed at home in these lockdown times, because the wonderful Lolla folks have an extensive menu for takeaway and delivery. Each pudding set comes with 2 bowls of pudding, some chive oil, and of course, sea urchin. You can choose to have less (but why??) or more sea urchin:
Sea Urchin Pudding Set (40g) $88
Sea Urchin Pudding Set (100g) $118
Additional bowls of pudding at $10 each
