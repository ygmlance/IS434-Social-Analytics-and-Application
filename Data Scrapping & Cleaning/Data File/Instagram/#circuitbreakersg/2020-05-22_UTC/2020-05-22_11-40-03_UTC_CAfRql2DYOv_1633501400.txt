Covid 19 has given us a chance to pause, think and recall what was missing in our daily hectic life. Our burning passion that formed Diversity Dancers from 1997 and for the very 1st time, 3 eras of dance are brought together to celebrate friendship, passion & women empowerment through this amazing video that we put together. 
This dance video is a tribute to all women around the world. Keep your passion alive, cherish every moment with your love ones and stay safe. 
Hope you enjoy this video
