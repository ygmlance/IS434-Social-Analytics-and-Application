DAY 45, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
CHILLI CHICKEN
This was made by my son for dinner today, with just a little help from me. 
He marinated the chicken in light & dark soya sauces, vinegar, chilli powder, salt & gnger garlic paste and corn starch. 
I helped him deep fry the chicken,  after which he did a quick stir fry in sesame oil, onion, chilli, garlic and spring onion.
Vegetarians could try this with tofu. .
