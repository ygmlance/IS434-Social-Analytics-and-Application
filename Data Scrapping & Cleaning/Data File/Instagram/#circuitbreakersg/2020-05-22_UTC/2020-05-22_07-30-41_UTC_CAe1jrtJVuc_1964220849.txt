Get your champagne ready, we’re almost at the end of the ‘circuit breaker’ in Singapore! 🍾 Whilst some key restrictions will still continue, gradual re-opening of activities definitely calls for a little bit of celebration (at home of course). We're toasting with a fresh and fruity Blanc de Noirs from @simply.champagne 🥂 
This pleasantly light and full-bodied champagne is produced entirely from Pinot Noir and Meunier grapes, sustainably farmed and handpicked in the Marne Valley, Champagne. With its beautiful sparkle and light acidity, it's perfect as an aperitif.

Available in Singapore exclusively @sashasfinefoods
