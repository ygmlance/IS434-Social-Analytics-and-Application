It has been a quiet period for public spaces in #singapore. With the #circuitbreakersg measures allowing only food takeaway or delivery, my family and I have been patronising our hawkers nearby - particularly those with no money on branding or even an online presence.
.
Fu Gui Fishball noodles is one such stall. The owner opens his stall everyday without fail, rain or shine to serve the humble but beloved #singaporean delight - fishball noodles🐟.
.
My dad loves his noodles and i #dabao this for him every other day. The chilli is shiok🌶 and we all love savouring the crunchy ikan bilis while chomping down the noodles 🍜. .
P.S. Bring your #tingkat to #dabaofood so you reduce the need for plastic containers🌱
.
