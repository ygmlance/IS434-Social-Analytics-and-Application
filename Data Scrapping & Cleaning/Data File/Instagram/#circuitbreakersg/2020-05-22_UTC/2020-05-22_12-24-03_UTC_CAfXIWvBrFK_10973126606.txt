It is no surprise that I'm nuts about 🍫 so Chocolate and Nutella sound so heavenly divine together!

Featuring Choco Nutella Cake | B$5 from @flourandbutterbn, served in four layers of chocolate sponge and generously sandwiched with Nutella on each layer. The chocolate sponges weren't sweet and the Nutella complimented just nice.

The founder @_alexchua reminded me to leave the cake in room temperature for a short while before digging in. It gave a better moist texture and I couldn't agree more!
