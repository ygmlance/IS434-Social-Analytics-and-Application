This year’s Ramadan may be a big departure from the festivities of previous years, but that doesn’t mean we can’t still celebrate from home. We’ve collated a list of 45 halal food delivery services for our Muslim readers to enjoy iftar meals across a variety of cuisines. For burger lovers, the wallet-friendly Burgs by Project Warung has a great delivery deal, with free islandwide delivery for orders above $30. If you’re a fan of seafood, we’ve got a few listed down, Cajun On Wheels sells seafood buckets fit for a feast. For more mains, scroll the list to find your favourite cuisines from Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Western, and Chinese eateries. Conclude your feastings with our sweet list of desserts.
