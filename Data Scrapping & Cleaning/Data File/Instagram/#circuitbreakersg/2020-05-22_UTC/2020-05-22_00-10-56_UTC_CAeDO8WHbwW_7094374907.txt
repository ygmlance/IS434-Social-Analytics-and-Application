I don’t get to enjoy Lor Mee often mainly because the good ones are located far away from where I live. When I do manage to convince myself to go the extra mile though, it’s almost always either the famous one at Old Airport Road or this baby right here from Tiong Bahru Market.

How do I describe lor mee to someone who hasn’t had it? It’s a noodle dish comprising crispy bits, meaty bits and chewy bits, served in a thick savory sludge. But perhaps one of the most flavorful sludges ever. Common garnishes include minced garlic, black vinegar and chili.

This particular stall—178 Lor Mee—is more famously known for their shark meat nuggets. That’s right, you read correctly... shark meat nuggets. These fritters are as luxuriously crisp as they come and the flavor is immense.
