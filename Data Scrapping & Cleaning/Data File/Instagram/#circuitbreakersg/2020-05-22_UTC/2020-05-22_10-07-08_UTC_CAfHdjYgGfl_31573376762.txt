🍫brownie

First attempt making brownies! 
A memorable one in fact, baking with a friend faraway in Dubai, 4hours time difference.
Brownie came out to my liking! More of a chocolate pound cake!!!♥️ I substituted the oil with water just to play around with the recipe. And if you like a flatter brownie, you may use a bigger tin to spread out. Additional toppings of your choice!

A tiny drizzle of chocolate sauce and voila!! 🌟
