On leave yesterday and almost went crazy in Scoop Wholefoods (and Meidi-ya)!!! ðŸ¤£ 
I haven't gone out for grocery- shopping for a long while since Redmart can deliver to the doorstep. Wanted very much to buy everything  but I actually come for the gluten free pasta only. I'll definitely go back there again real soon!

On a side note, I really hate going into the big malls to shop. Getting in and out of the building is a real pain! These circuit breaker measures really work on people like me! ðŸ¤£
