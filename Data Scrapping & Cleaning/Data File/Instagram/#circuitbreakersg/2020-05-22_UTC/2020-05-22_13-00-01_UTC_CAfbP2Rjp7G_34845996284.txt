Home made Yong Tau Fu

Actually there is a quick and simple way to make yong tau fu and doesn’t need to buy pre-packed or frozen one. 
I like it with tofu puff but it also goes well shiitake mushroom or tomato

Ingredient: minced pork 100g, fish paste, spring onion, tofu puff

❶ marinate minced pork with corn flour, 1 teaspoon of soya sauce, 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce and pepper
❷ slice spring onion. Add fish paste, marinated pork and spring onion. Stir to mix well
❸ cut center of the toufu puff and slot the mixed paste in
❹ steam or cook in soup
