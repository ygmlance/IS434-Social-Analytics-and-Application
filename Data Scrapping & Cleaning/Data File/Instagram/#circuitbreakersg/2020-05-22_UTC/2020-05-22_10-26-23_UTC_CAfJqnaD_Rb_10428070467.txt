☆In Another Galaxy☆
Anything galactic never fails to captivate. This artwork feels more like an intuitive art, with the lines and colour placement more fluid to capture the dreamy feel of space.

Such fluid art that allows creative flow is something that I really enjoy but struggle at times to break it down into something more structured for participants to understand. Margaret and Yixin are excellent and experienced participants who understand the idea and concept of this flow and I think they did beautifully!

Thanks for the great company and glad that you two enjoyed painting your own galaxy!
