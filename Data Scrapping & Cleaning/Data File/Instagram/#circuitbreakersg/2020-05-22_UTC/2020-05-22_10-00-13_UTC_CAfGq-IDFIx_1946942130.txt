Pasta is a simple dish to whip up at home, but if youâ€™re looking to treat yourself, we have a list of pasta delivery options to get your cravings fixed. 
In our â€˜Under $15â€™ category, Tipo Pasta Bar is a halal joint selling affordable pasta dishes that are spiked with aromatic ingredients such as truffle and escargot. The homely eatery Pastaria Abate features handmade pasta such as a tomato-drenched Marinara priced at just $8.80.

For pasta under $30, we have iO Italian Osteria which is known by many as one of the best pasta restaurants in SG. The popular Italian eatery has islandwide delivery with no minimum order. The hip Italian restaurant AmÃ² is also offering islandwide delivery for DIY pasta kits including a Luxurious Truffle Pasta Kit ($19.25), as well as legit pasta and pizza.
