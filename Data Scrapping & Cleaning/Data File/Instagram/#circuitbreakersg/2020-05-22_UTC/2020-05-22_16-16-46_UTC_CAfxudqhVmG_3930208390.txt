WOW..honestly got a little tear of joy in my eyes when I first saw this video. I don’t post as much pics/results of my clients because to me, word of mouth and “the subject” (my clients) will speak volume for themselves. (Also unfortunately a lot of my clients don’t do social media or are really really shy😅) I’m so proud of you @sherine927 WE DID IT! No... YOU did it.
Still, we have much to do after the #circuitbreaker as fitness is a lifelong journey! See you soon! Thank you for this ☺️🔥♥️
