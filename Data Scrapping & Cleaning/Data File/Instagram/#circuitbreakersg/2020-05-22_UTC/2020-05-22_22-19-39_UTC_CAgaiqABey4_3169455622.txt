As we about to bid goodbye to this extraordinary Ramadan, let us look back at how we have celebrated this blessed month.
_
We pray that Allah swt will accept all of our deeds. May we all be granted with more Ramadans to come. May we meet another Ramadan where we can pray at our masjids, break fast with our family and friends, and qiyam and i'tikaf together.

Indeed, this Ramadan has been a challenging one, yet deeply meaningful for us. Definitely, a Ramadan to remember. Physically isolated, but socially and spiritually connected.
