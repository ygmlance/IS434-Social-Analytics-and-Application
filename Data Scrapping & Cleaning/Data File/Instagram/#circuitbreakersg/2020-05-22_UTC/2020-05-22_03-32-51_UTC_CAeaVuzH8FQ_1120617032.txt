Thinking of some vegetables to add into your meals today? How about asparagus?⁠
⁠
It is an excellent healing vegetable that is high in essential minerals. It contains phytochemical compounds such as chlorophyll and lutein that act as critical organ cleansers. They get deep into organs such as the liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys, scrubbing out the toxins they find there.⁠
