Meet Harrison and Sri, the 18-year-olds volunteering their time for the underprivileged, all while studying for their final year IB exams 👍🏽 From distributing meals to painting flats for those displaced, they are part of a group of 8 youths who came together on their own to help the homeless and those displaced. You can find them at @comm.unitysg!
