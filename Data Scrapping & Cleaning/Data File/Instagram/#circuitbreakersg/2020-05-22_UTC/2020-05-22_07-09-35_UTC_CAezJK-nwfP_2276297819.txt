This evening, SAOT facilitated a telerehab discussion over a tele-platform with speakers ranging from acute to commuity and adults to pediatrics. Through the session, we get to understand their experiences in implementing telehealth in various clinical settings, the feasibility and challenges.

The very engaging Padlet platform with enthusiastic questions for the speakers addressed the pragmatic areas to focus on telerehab during the current unprecedented times. Indeed telerehab has shown its capability to maximise our clients' ability to engage in therapy while having the convenience in the comforts of their homes.

We wish all OTs the very best as you venture into the use of telerehab with your clients. 
Please look forward to more of such virtual sharing and tele-learning sessions to come.
