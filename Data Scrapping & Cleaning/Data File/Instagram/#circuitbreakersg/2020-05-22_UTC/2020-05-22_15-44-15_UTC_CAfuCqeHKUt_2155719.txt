I have been spending my afternoon n evening trying to perfect tutu kueh making (嘟嘟糕)... it is still so imperfect...
Went through many rounds of frying the rice flour to get the right texture and steaming it and trying to master the unmoulding skill. The tutu kueh filling that I did today is gula melaka coconut filling. 
I guess I have to try again and look for a tutu shifu. 🐼 
BUT I’m happy as I’m slowly getting there. 
It’s time to grab a bite of the hard work. 
I look forward to the weekend to chill a little.
