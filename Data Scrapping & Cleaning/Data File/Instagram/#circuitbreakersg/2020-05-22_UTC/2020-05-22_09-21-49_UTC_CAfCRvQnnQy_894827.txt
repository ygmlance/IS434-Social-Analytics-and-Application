Judging by the amount of food I’ve been cooking lately in my posts, it might seem that only our mouths have been working out the most.🤣

Bubba doesn’t like to run with me because she’d rather run in school where it’s “normal”🙄.

So the best workout for her to sweat buckets in the shortest amount of time, and burn the calories before she turns into a human dumpling(🙈)due to sports restrictions amidst this #circuitbreakersg would be these AI agility workouts.

As to motivate all young padawans, the Jedi master has to set the example and move it move it first!🙃🙂🙃

Who doesn’t like to play games and beat high scores??🤩🤓🤨

(Also trains your response and reaction to hazards like your dog that tries to trip you amidst the workout.🤣)
