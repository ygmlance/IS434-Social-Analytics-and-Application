|We shared so many memorable meals and experiences and top of mind is Joel Robuchon - the langoustine ravioli. I think the biggest influence you had on my palette is the appreciation of French cuisine. I was largely favoring Asian food but I fell in love with a broader range of cuisine after our TAD days. Hope that both of you enjoy this meal from Bistro Du Vin - it‚Äôs one of my favourite French restaurants in town.|
.
The lobster ravioli (although not to be compared apples/apples), certainly brought back the past - that perfect memory of the langoustine ravioli that is no more...
.
Classic French cuisine. What can I say? Thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful...and the entire experience! (Perhaps their choice of sustainable packaging made from sugar cane fiber helped enhance the experience.)
.
And just as we thought we had no more room for desserts...that Apple tart was to us - like fireworks at the end of a marvelous parade.
