Chanced upon this ice jelly powder which @viviansoon mentioned its nice so bought to try😊
Searched many marts n grocery stores but couldnt find any konnyaku jelly powder😡like the illusive unsalted butter n Philly cream cheese (few weeks back)☹️ Who said we have stockpiles?😝 Ok this jelly is not bad, refreshing! (just dissolve in boiling water) Added fresh lychees and longans since they are in season n a wedge of lemon.
