Hi everyone ðŸŒ¼ itâ€™s @sugarfreesaccharin here, Iâ€™m starting a small fundraising campaign to raise funds for migrant workers in Singapore and Iâ€™ll be selling E-cards that I have personally designed! ALL proceeds will go directly to @twc2sg. To support this cause, simply head over to my campaign page in my bio! Do consider sharing this campaign with your loved ones & letâ€™s spread the love ðŸŒ¼ -
