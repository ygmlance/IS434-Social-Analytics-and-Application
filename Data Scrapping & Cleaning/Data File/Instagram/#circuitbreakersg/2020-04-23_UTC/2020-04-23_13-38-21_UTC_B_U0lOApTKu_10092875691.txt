With the COVID-19 numbers soaring locally, the Ministry of Health has given strict guidelines to all dentists to see only urgent and emergency dental conditions. This is to reduce the number of people leaving the safety of their homes. We deeply regret any inconvenience caused. Stay safe, everyone!  #sunshinedental #sunshinedentalsg #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #covid19 #covid19sg #singapore #staysafe #stayhomestaysafe #dentalclinic #dentalclinicsg
