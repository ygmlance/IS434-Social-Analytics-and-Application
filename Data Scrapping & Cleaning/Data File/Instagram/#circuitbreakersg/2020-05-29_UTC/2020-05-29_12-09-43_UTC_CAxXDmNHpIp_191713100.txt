🕢Dinner: 5-DAYS FERMENTATION | HANDMADE PIZZA🍕🍕
-Pepperoni with Mushroom
-Tropical Hawaiian
-Tomatoes & Mushroom

I never thought I would have the courage to make my own pizza doughs, as I’m worried they will turn out to be as hard as stone! 😂

A big thank you to @teachingpoints for his incredibly delicious 5 DAYS FERMENTATION pizza recipe!! It does not require any kneading but in a pizza dough form!
So simple yet so good! All it requires just a little of your good patience 🤪

The crust is so airy, light and it’s definitely comparable to any pizza restaurant !

Now, who said you can’t make deliciously good pizza at home.

Deliziosa ! Lip smacking😋
