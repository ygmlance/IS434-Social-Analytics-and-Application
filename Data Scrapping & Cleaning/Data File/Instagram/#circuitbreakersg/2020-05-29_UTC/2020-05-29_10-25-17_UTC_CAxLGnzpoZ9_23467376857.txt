It’s okay to be mediocre. .

Social media has created a world in which everyone looks so perfect except for the person who is looking from his/her screen. But the truth is that most of us are pretty average at most things we do. .

To be truly great at something, lots of time and energy have to be dedicated. Do we have that? .

Don’t feel bad if you don’t have a big house, a luxury car or a successful business. Take pleasure in the little things in life: reading a good book, watching your child grow up, laughing with someone you love. 
They may sound ordinary and boring but they are the things that actually matter. .
