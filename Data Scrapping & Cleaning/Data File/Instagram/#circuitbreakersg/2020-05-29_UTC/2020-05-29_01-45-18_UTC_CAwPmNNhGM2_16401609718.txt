🔨 POUNDING FUN 🔨
Ha loves hammering and pounding things with her other wooden hammer 🔨 
I figured she would be excited to explore the hammer peg play. It is excellent for concentration, eye-hand 👁🖐🏼 coordination, colour recognition and hand 🖐🏼 grip and arm muscle strength. It was heartwarming to see Ha's determination as she pounded at the pegs and Hu trying his best to guide her to the right colours 💕
