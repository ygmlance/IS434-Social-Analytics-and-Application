8 weeks of circuit breaker has come to an end. On retrospection, I might actually miss these glorious days as I transform into a full time housewife cooking meals for my family. .
Hb asked me why my Ooh Lua has no flour. So today, I cook another one with flour. And I really miss the sweet sour pork and spinach dishes which used to be a staple of my childhood days. .
