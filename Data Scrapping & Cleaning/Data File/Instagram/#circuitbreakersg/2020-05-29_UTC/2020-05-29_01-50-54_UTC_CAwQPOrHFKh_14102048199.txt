Last night, my younger son picked one of his favourite Chinese books for our bedtime story. 《球球和哥哥》is a simple, charming book designed to introduce the topic of sibling mimicry to kids, and pave the way for more conversation.

In a nutshell, Little Pup adores his big brother and loves following him around and copying everything he does. Naturally, the elder sibling finds this irritating and hatches a plot to slip away so he can play on his own. All goes well until he accidentally breaks mum’s flower pot and is caught in the act by Little Pup. Afraid that Little Pup will tell mum, big brother spends all his time playing with the little one to keep his secret safe...
.
This is a sweet and relatable story - both my sons immediately identified themselves with the pup siblings and took delight in their antics (even imitating the characters). After reading the story, we also took the opportunity to ask the kids to reflect on their behaviour and explain why little children love copying their elder siblings.

P.S. We bought the book in Taiwan so it’s translated in Traditional Chinese. The original is written in Japanese by Yuka Shimada.
