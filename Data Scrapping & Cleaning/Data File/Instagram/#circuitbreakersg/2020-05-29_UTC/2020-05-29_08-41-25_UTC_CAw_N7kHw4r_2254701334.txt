Another harvest day for my 4th batch of sprouts. They look pretty in pink because I did not cover them properly on the second day. I also bought the beans from a different source it turned out to be fatter then the previous batches. I also learnt that those beans packed in vacuum pack are not good for sprouting so don’t use those. Today, I had my zen moment of taking off the tails and the total yield was 2 bags. Happy!
