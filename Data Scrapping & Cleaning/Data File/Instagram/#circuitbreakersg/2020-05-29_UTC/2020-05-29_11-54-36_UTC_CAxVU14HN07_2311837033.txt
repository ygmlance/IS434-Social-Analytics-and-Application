Man Man Unagi for #TGIF dinner tonight! So happy to discover itâ€™s available for delivery. As expected, hitsumabushi travels really well, arrived nice and warm, generous pieces of fluffy unagi with all the condiments. Had a satisfying bowl of it in dashi at the end. Was greedy and added an extra unagi kabayaki.  So good.
