How do you care for your eyes?

Me, 👁 By eating green leafies and yellow and orange fruits and veggies that are rich in beta carotine or Vitamin A and Lutein. .
👁 By wearing eye protection/glasses that blocks UV radiation and blue light. .
👁 By practicing good eye habits at a young age such as not to abuse eyes from watching or reading too much. .
👀 And by taking eye supplement @usc_strongkids Strong Eye.
