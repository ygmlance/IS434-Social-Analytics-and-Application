**update** they now have a brand new website you can order from! https://wethehawkers.com/collections/chop-chop-biryani-meats

#Cheatday came early for us, and it was so worth it! I had been eyeing @chopchopbiryani for quite a while, but since they only deliver on weekday afternoons (when we usually skip lunch), I had resisted — up till now... We ordered their pork masala and char siew (2nd pic) biryani sets. I am a big #biryani fan, and this really hit all the right notes, from the tenderness of the pork to the delectably spicy gravy and rice. The onsen egg was the perfect topping to this incredible lunch box.

All for just $6.50 per set! In order make the min order of $20, we also ordered their Tornado (chicken) #OmuRice (3rd pic), but are saving that for dinner. I did have a bite of the creamy omelette, and definitely approve! Will update on the full dish later.

Overall highly recommended 😍👍 and a commendable job from such a small business! 👏
