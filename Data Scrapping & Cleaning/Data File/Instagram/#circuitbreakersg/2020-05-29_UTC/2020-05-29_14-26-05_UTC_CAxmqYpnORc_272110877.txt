Day 51. Dramatic morning sky. This was taken at 0830 becos I forgotten to set alarm at 0645. ðŸ˜† Lunch - mushrooms and roasted pork belly risotto becos Missy loves it. Dinner - Yakitori chicken skewers, sauteed kailan and aburaage and grilled oyster shrooms, becos my favourite dishes. Evening temperature is kinder to us. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #instadaily
