Spent the night making mini cheese chicken sausage rolls with the kids. As usual, they have to taste test everything at every stage ðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™Š Thankful that these 2 batches of mini rolls turned out successful as we are giving it away to some friends to spread some cheer.

Circuit breaker phase 0 is coming to an end. Hope things will look up henceforth.

Lucky we made extras because LG took 4 rolls right out of the oven... Can you also spot the twin sausages rolls?

TGIF and hope your weekend will be great, even in lockdown mode.

Thanks to @sonianll for the recipe.
