Iâ€™m learning to enjoy the extra time that the circuit breaker has given me. I sometimes wonder how everyoneâ€™s feeling about the gradual reopening of businesses. Iâ€™ve heard mixed reactions. Some are glad to relinquish a semblance of normalcy. Others are griping about how slow the reopening process will be. Well, as a Medical Social Worker, I for one am glad to see my regular patients again. Perhaps when the next patient makes my job difficult I might regret what I just said ðŸ˜…. Weâ€™ll see.
