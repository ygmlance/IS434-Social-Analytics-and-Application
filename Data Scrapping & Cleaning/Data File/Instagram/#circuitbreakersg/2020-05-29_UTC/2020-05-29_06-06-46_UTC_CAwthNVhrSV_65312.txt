Our 12th eid. But it felt like the first time because eidulfitri this year is different and im stuck at home with this favorite person. 
There is no one else I want to spend my CB with but w you. Cherishing our last few days of Stay-at-home before we both will be out and about again, spending our days and nights at work. CB has impacted us in many ways that we didnt plan or imagine. and for that, i am forever grateful.
