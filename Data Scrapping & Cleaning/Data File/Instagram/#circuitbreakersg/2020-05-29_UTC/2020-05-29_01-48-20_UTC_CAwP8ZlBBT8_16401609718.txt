🍓 STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE 🍓
Good morning everyone 👋
Rise and shine 🌅 
The one question that makes and sometimes break my morning even before I open my eyes 👀(especially if I slept late the night before) "What shall we do today?" 😍🤣
Two equally eager pairs of eyes 👀 staring at me and ready to run their engine at full throttle 🤣🤣😝😝
.

So let’s start our morning right with some strawberry 🍓 milkshake shall we?
Hu was excited 😆 to be using the cutting knife 🔪 and the hand mixer for the first time while Ha was just oh so happy 😁 to be pouring the milk🥛(blooper alert🚨). We all know that all these 👆🏼 are great motor skills activities and real life skills for our little ones to explore. So go ahead and have fun exploring with them because along the way there will be beautiful surprises from our little ones 💕
.

I thought my videos were good since it captured what my little ones were doing but Hu surprised and blew me away with his videography 🎥 skills. He took my phone📱and captured a perfect-to-me frontal view video 💕
