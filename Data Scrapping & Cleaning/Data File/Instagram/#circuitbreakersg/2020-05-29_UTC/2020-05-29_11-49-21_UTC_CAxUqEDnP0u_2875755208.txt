Japanese Tensha beads and other beautiful Oriental jewellery have always been a fascination for me. Hereâ€™s a mini-launch of my large Tenshas for a start as an early welcome to June. Enjoy!
20% of the proceeds will go to either @hphpcommunity or @mettacats_and_dogs_sanctuary. We support both causes passionately.
