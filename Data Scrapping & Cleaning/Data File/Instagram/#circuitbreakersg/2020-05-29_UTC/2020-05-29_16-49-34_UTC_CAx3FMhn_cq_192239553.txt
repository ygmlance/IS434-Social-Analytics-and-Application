#theAteamSim really wants to see their dentist during the cb
.
First it was boom with extraction of 2 teeth and now A having pain from a cavity
.
If I were the dentist, my mind would be bungled with her request to extract the milk teeth instead of filling it. Next up, whatâ€™s the filling made up of (clover oil and zinc)
.
Lots of restrictions for dentists, no scaling work, no permanent filling; too much aerosol. In Jun, apts need 45 min interval between adult patients and 30 mins for kids, no permanent filling yet
.
Ok will push back our mid year review to July then, hopefully restrictions ease up and we can get more dental work done
