#circuitbreakerday53 // Finally dug into @pastasingapura’s incredible shrimp-roe #pappardelle and “S&B” #genovese sauce - not much of a point of reference, since this #genovesesauce knocked those Japanese curry cubes way out of the ballpark, with its melted meaty oniony, layered umami, homerun. And to mix metaphors, the fried garlic and walnut toppings were exactly the counterpoint these noods needed. .
Good fuel as we muddled through #hosea11 this afternoon. Many hundred years after Hosea, Matthew quoted Hosea 11:1, saying that this was fulfilled in the infant Jesus’ “exile” to Egypt - to escape the genocidal King Herod (Matthew 2).
.
Read superficially, Matthew seems to be quoting Hosea 11:1 out of context. But every Bible author is extremely exact and deliberate in their writing. So  we just needed to figure out Matthew’s working. .
Proposition: perhaps Matthew is quite rightly merging at least 3 or 6 #biblicaltheology threads from the #oldtestament: .
(1) Exodus as anticipation of #newexodus for (2) Israel, God’s “son”;
(3) Exodus as anticipation of #newrescue for (4) Israel’s king/David’s offspring, God’s “son”; and
(5) the new Moses leading this salvation, also being (6) the new David.
.
• In about 13th century B.C., God, full of compassion and care and commitment, rescued his “son” (Exodus 4:22), Israel, out of slavery in Egypt.
.
• Referencing God’s character and posture of love, protection, and care for his “son”, Israel, the Psalmist in #Psalm80 cried to God to rescue His people again. .
• In 8th century B.C., Hosea too referenced this seminal event as demonstrating God’s undeserved compassion and mercy on His people, and His particular love and care for them. Because God does not change, God would not visit fully-deserved judgment on Israel, but would save them again from “Egypt” (Hosea 11).
.
• King David’s offspring would be God’s “son” too (2 Samuel 7:14), and a new salvation was anticipated for David and his offspring (eg. Psalm 18).
.
• Hosea links the new Moses (1:11) with the new David (3:5). So David’s offspring will be leading this new rescue. .
• Matthew says that Jesus is the “son”- new Israel, the new David, the new Moses,who rescues.
