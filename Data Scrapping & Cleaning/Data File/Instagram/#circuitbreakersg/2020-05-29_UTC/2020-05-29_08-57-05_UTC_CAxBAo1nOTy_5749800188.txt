Peered outside my window hearing the cackles of Laughingthrush. But what I saw was not a Laughingthrush but Drongo once again. mimicking calls 😂 What a clever bird.

Today marks Day 53/56 of Singapore's pseudo-lockdown a.k.a. 'Circuit Breaker'. We are almost there. Let's all do our part! 🙏🏽 Hope to be able to meet my friends and see the outside world more when the coronavirus is defeated or lessened!
