Extraordinary evening during extraordinary times! Participated in my first virtual charity event via zoom! ACI Singapore’s very first online event. Live Aid...Financial Market’s give back to the community. 560 members and friends from the Financial Market fraternity participated! Curated meals from 23 restaurants were delivered to all the participants.
