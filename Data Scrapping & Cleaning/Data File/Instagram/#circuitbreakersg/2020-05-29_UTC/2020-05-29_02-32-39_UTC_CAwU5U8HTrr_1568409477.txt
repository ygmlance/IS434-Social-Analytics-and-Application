Dear friends, we’ve been holding our breath for the last week, but unfortunately, we still have not heard back from the authorities on our appeal to re-open in phase 1. So unfortunately, we will have to cancel all existing appointments in June. We will be contacting you all soon to reschedule.
.
However, fret not as we will be extending our 20% advanced booking discount to July and our ‘free credits’ for gift card promo is still available so you can still enjoy the discount when we do get to open our doors.😉
.
We were really, really hoping to welcome everyone back in June but it’s ok, we’re not going to let this knock us down! 💪🏼 We’ll continue to stay positive and keeping our 🤞🏼. In the mean time, we’ve got several activities planned (laughter yoga, anyone? 😉) with our team to keep us all occupied and sane, sooooo...why be moody when you can shake your booty🤪
