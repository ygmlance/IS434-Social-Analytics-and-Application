Hey all, a while back we made this wardrobe planner to help shed some light on how you can intentionally style yourself by aligning the clothes you have with your current lifestyle. Since itâ€™s looks like weâ€™re going to have to work from home June & beyond, we thought it might be useful to share some styling worksheets from the planner (for FREE!) with those of you who may want to take this time to reconsider your personal style intentions and make some changes to accommodate your post covid lifestyle. Make yourself a priority because nobody else can do that for you. Your style, your responsibility, you get to do something about it today. Meanwhile, stay safe & chin up everyone. Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ is emerging out of CB slowly but surely. We will get to serve you all soon! .
