When the circuit breaker was implemented, many fashion retailers were hit hard and our #ChangeMakersSg @refashsg was no exception. With all nine of their outlets having to cease operations, Refash faced the crisis of having all revenue streams being cut off, affecting the survival of their entire business.⠀
⠀
Instead of giving in to circumstance, Refash pivoted to make the most of their situation. Within three days, founder Aloysius Sng started #refashcares – where certified surgical masks were sourced and sold at affordable prices.⠀
⠀
With this new initiative, Refash was able to continue funding their operations and employees throughout this period.⠀
⠀
In support of our #ChangeMakersSG, Geneco has purchased 15,000 masks from #refashcares to be distributed to the less privileged in Singapore. These masks will be essential for those in need, even after the Circuit Breaker measures gradually ease in phases.⠀
⠀
By roping in the help of another #ChangeMakersSG @foodbanksg, we are able to pool our efforts together in reaching out to the vulnerable communities.⠀
⠀
The current COVID-19 situation has presented many challenges within our lives, but instead of focusing on the negativity, let us inspire each other to make the most of what we have.⠀
⠀
We choose to Power Togetherness, alongside Refash and The Food Bank, for the ones in need.⠀
