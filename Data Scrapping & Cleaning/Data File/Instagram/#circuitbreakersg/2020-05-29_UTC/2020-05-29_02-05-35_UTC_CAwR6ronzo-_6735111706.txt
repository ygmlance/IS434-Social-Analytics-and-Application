SINGAPORE 🇸🇬 — Looks like Singapore Cocktail Festival 2020 ain't happening any time soon but that's not going to stop us, imbibers, from, well, imbibing 🤷🏻‍♂️ ⁣
⁣
From now till 31 May 2020, join us in celebrating SGFC @ Home alongside 26 of Singapore’s best bars as each bar presents a signature cocktail inspired by the words “Unity” & “Positivity”, a nod to frontline workers and everyone who has remained resilient during these trying months.⁣
⁣
As part of the event, all cocktails will be available for takeout or delivery from respective bars and that's not all. Virtual cocktail workshops will also be happening, so get booking!⁣
