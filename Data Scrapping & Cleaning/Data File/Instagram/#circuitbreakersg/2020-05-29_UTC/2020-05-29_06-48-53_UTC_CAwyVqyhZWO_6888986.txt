Have you noticed that there are more snails around during this period?⁠
⁠
I'm not sure if it's because people are at home, so the snails aren't getting stepped on as often, or there's just a sudden boom in the snail population due to the weather.⁠
⁠
But whatever the reason, my kids love to take the time to stop and look for snails. It gives them time to soak up the sun, pause to look at nature, and some days, we even see other things too.⁠
⁠
We've seen grasshoppers, crickets, butterflies, and even lizards. It helps that the green patches are a little overgrown during this time.⁠
⁠
I think it's a great way to introduce nature to the kids, and it forces me to brush up on my knowledge of little creatures and their biology.⁠
⁠
My daughter will go, "Mummy, can you tell me more about (insert topic of interest)?"⁠
⁠
So what is a mother to do but answer?⁠
⁠
Do you take time to stop and look at nature when you go out? What kind of creatures do you see when you go out?
