Cranberry cream cheese buns. Love the oozy creamcheese and loads more cranberries than one would get from a bakery. Note to self in future, the oven runs hotter than expected. Rainy weather always gets me baking where the slight coolness keeps some ingredients from sweating and oozing before it should. It's raining again #whattobakenext #stayhomestaysafe .
