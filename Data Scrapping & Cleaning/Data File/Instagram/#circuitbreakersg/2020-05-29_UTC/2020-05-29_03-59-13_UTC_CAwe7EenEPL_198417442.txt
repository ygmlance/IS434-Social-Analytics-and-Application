💖Half a year is about to pass by...💖
Have you adapted to the new norms? Have you found more time to do what you love? Have you been crushing your goals? Have you learnt to become more disciplined? 
I think while everyone is dying to get out of the #circuitbreakersg, there are some positives from this trying period... Learn to let go of things we can’t control, look for positives and make the best out if the situation. Be that ray of sunshine amidst the grey skies. 🤗☀️ #sgfitness #sgphysique #fitness #stayhome #staypositive #circuitbreaker #bepositive #mentalhealth #bikinifitness #bikinicompetitor #bikiniathlete #girlswholift #girlswhogym #fitgirl #girlswithmuscle #stayactive #improvementseason #offseason #healthylifestyle #legsday #shouldersday #fightagainstcorona #covid19 #bodybuilding #bodybuildingwomen #tgif #noexcuses #fitnessmotivation #sunshine
