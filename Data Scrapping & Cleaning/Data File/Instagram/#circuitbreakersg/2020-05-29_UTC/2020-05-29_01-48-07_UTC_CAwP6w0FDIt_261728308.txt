If you ask financial planners, chances are that none of them had this career on top when asked about career choices. 🤦🏻

Sometimes I really enjoy looking at past photos to take a walk down the memory lane. It’s amazing where life takes us. When I look back 10 years ago, I was a clown (literally) and I had so much fun making children laugh.😊

Then I moved on to dancing and singing, performing for crowds and it felt like I belong on the stage!🤩🤩🤩
•
All these experience shaped me into who I am today and I am very fortunate to have found what I really enjoy doing, my calling.

It is true. It is not the most glamorous career to be a financial consultant because your intentions are not seen as what they are supposed to be. But when you can change a person’s mind about financial planning and they see value in your work, everything is worth it.💯
