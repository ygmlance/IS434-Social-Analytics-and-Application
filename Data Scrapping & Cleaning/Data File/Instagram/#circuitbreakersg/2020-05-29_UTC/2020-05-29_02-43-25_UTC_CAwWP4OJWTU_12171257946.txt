Throwback to my Werktangk #streamscape, my last rainbow shiner died today so im particularly nostalgic. The small tank i have for them at home is just not suitable and i really hope everyone else survives.... I'm still so sad I had to decomm it due to the #circuitbreakersg . ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ #werktangk #riparian #riparium #ã‚¢ã‚¯ã‚¢ãƒªã‚¦ãƒ  #æ°´æ™¯ #daniosondhii #notropischrosomus
