The lockdown life isn’t coming to an end just yet and so kettlebells keep me company almost daily.  Today’s work was lower body GPP, aka LEG day. I may not have mile long legs but they’re still legs that help me move daily😝, stumpy as they are. Double kettlebell paused front squats, kettlebell sumo DL, shrimp squats, icky pistol squats, 100 double kettlebell swings..... #kettlebellworkout #kettlebellswings #girevik #lockdowntraining #strongaf #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #sgunited #girevoysport
