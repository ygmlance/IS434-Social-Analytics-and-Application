CB Day53 🚶🏻‍♀️
Have been walking / exercising at nearby parks (per advisory) since CB started. And falling in love with the lush greenery where the trees and wild plants can grow and grow without being mow down ever so often. Fruits and flowers are in abundance. Butterflies, bees, dragonflies are back. Seeing more birds too!!! It’s so beautiful 😍 
Took this opportunity to take as many photos (with handphone only) of wild flowers, weeds, plants, trees before CB ends [already the maintenance has started😢] Google to match names to these beautiful plants and starting a series soon😀
