[Homecooked] Cir Breaker Day 53 Lunch.

I cooked laksa for lunch today using the ready laksa gravy packs from @foodyo_cafe. Just prepare all the ingredient toppings, heat up the gravy, add coconut milk, cook noodles, assemble everything and serve up.

I didn't have the proper yellow noodles or thick vermicelli at home, hence I used Korean ramyeon instead. I also didn't have fishcake and laksa leaves, thus substitute them with Japanese chikuwa and kaffir lime leaves. My laksa combines many ingredients from different Asian countries yeh? Haha.
