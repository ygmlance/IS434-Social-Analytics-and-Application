🦞Ramen with a Spicy Lobster Broth🦞So many trial and errors to perfect our ramen broth and we are finally getting closer to perfection. All I can say is that the lobster broth is so tasty!!! Even better than pork or chicken! Prawn comes in a close second❤️⁣

And the thing with these broth is that, we just add in whatever our palates fancy (spice of course is something we will add) as well as it has to have that rich, creamy taste. First you have to make the lobster stock which consist of lobster shells, onions, garlic, carrots and water. Boil and let simmer for a good 6-8 hours and then you use this base stock to add in stuff you want your ramen broth to taste like (like miso paste, chilli flakes, Dashi, more garlic/onions, milk etc)⁣

Do you make your own stock? What’s your favourite? 💗⁣
