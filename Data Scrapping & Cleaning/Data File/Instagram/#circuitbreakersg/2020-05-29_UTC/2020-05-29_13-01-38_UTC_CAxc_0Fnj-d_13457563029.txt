When Jessie from @grays_at_play first shared about the life cycle of a dandelion plant, I didn’t quite understand what she meant.
.
Not until this lockdown, when our garden and parks haven’t been tended to and wildflowers covered our fields.
.
We couldn’t do nature walks for now, so weeding and wildflower picking near home became our best alternative.
.
🌿We blew lilac tasselflowers (which I previously thought were dandelions) and watched the spores disperse. We brought them home for study and observed how the buds looked just before they bloomed all white and puffy.
.
Left to right, I ordered them from buds, to flowers, to a completely dispersed plant. Swipe ⬅️ for close-ups.
.
And as I got this set-up ready to press, my little girl took the excess flowers for process art. She stuck them all over an unwanted box, and declared it a present for me.
.
“You make this for me, I make a present for you.” Thank you, my darling 🥰.
