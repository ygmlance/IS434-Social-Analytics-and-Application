Since I have been recreating many dishes at home during this #circuitbreakersg , the husband and father presented me with a challenge and asked if I could make some German Pork Knuckle (their favourite) for them. So here I am starting on the prep work on the pork hock for tomorrow’s dinner. Fingers crossed that it tastes yummy and pass their taste test! 👩🏻‍🍳 #jennacooks #stayhome #germanporkknuckle #germanfood
