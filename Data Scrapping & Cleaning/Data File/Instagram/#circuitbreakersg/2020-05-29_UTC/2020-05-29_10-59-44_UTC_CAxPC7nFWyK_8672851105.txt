#ZZSHARES on RAISE YOUR VOICE
A collaboration between National Youth Council Singapore and The Inside Space, I'll be sharing my insights about money as a guest speaker on their FB Live Session.

When I was first approached to do this, my first thought was - "What can I possibly offer? All I do is sit down with people and talk about money." The reason I agreed in the end, isn't because I am an expert who has got money all figure it out, but because of all the conversations I had with people (and myself) about money, I truly believe we can feel empowered when we take charge of our finances, even during a global crisis.

So don't be mistaken, this is not finance 101 or top 10 financial tips. At the end of the session, I hope it will get you curious to start having an honest conversation about money with yourself.

This one is to honour all the people who have so generously shared their stories about money with me - their fears, struggles, milestones, achievements, who have also inspired me every day to be a better adviser and person.

Come and hang with me tomorrow, 30 May, 2pm!
