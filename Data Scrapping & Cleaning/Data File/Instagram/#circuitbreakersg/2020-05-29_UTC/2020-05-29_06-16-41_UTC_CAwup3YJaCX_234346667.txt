【Recipe】Since weekend is almost here, guess we can all use another banana cake recipe to help us get through the weekend (baking and eating it!). #honeybeesweetscakebakes 
This is Banana Rum Cake, rich and intense. If you’re looking for fluffy and springy, this ain’t your cake. Texture for this is more like moist, rich and soft. And it gets better the next couple of days. 
I love it butter toasted the next day. Served with a dollop of cold mascarpone cheese 🤤 很推荐哦

If you don’t like rum or don’t have rum, and wanna skip it. Then the cake won’t turn out as good. It’s like strawberry cream cake without cream? You know what I mean. So I suggest looking for other banana cake recipes ya. Try other recipes here  #honeybeesweetscakebakes 
I make my own Vanilla Bean Rum extract. Soaking quality vanilla pods in good rum over a minimum of 12 months before using. You can of course just use regular rum and vanilla extract...should be about the same! #honeybeebakesbananarumcake
