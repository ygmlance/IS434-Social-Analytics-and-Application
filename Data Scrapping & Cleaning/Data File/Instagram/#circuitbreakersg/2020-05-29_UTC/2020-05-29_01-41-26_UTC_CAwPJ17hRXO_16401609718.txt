☃️ HELLO OLAF ☃️
Hello Everyone 👋 
Hope you guys are doing great! 
We know winter ❄️ is still some time away but we couldn’t resist our early winter ❄️ play. Where we live is forever summer ☀️ and I guess we are missing the snow ❄️ especially the snow-capped mountains 🏔 a little too much today.
Do you want to build a snowman ☃️? Yes I do! I want to build Olaf! Hu exclaimed. 
Let’s join HuHa in building their clay Olaf ☃️ topped with paper confetti 🎊 as snow ❄️ Happy playing guys 💕
Take care and stay safe always 💕
