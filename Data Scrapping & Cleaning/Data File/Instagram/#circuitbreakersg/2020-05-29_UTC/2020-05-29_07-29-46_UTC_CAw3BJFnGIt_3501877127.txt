TGIF darlings! How are y'all? 💗⁠
⁠
Here's a quick reminder that KELLY X TWC2, my charity fundraiser on behalf of migrant workers in Singapore, will be ending next Monday, 1 June at 11:59 pm, in conjunction with the end of the circuit breaker in Singapore. Till then, I'm still offering Tarot readings via e-mail at $33 SGD per question, with all proceeds going to TWC2.⁠
⁠
Wanna contribute? Email hello@kellylightworker.com with the title FUNDRAISING, and include your questions. Once your questions are confirmed (I need to check them to make sure the Tarot will give you a good answer) and payment is made, you'll get your reading via e-mail in 1 business day.⁠
⁠
Freewill donations 💰 are also accepted - email hello@kellylightworker.com for details!⁠
