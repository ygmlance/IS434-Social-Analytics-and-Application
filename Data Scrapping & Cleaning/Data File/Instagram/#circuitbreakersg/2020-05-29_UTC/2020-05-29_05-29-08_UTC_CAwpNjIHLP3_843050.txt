*Gooey Chocolate Brownies*

On my 4th baking adventure, I attempted to make brownies! Itâ€™s also the opening ceremony of my hand mixer and first time ever using it. I was a bit apprehensive before I used it but it wasnâ€™t hard to control or chaotic as I thought it to be. Previously when I tried the stick blender whisk, it was a huge mess flying everywhere. Wrong tool used. ðŸ˜… #bakingnoob .

Decided to get some good #chocolate on my last trip to get baking supplies, so I used Valrhona Guanaja 70 for these brownies! .

I would say, I managed to achieve gooey brownies success! Very pleased with the texture and flavour.. rich with chocolate flavour. This will be perfect when warmed up and paired with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream.. my tea-time plan for later. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ Thanks to @joycesayshello for the gooey brownies recipe!
