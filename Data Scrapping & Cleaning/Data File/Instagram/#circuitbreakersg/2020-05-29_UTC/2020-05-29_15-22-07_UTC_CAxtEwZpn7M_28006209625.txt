| GUESS THE MOVIE! ðŸŽ¬ |

I had a ton of fun re-creating this scene! Went onto YouTube, watched the clip a couple of times, had a good laugh and got inspired to change my set up! ðŸš˜

If you guessed Fast & Furious 8, the scene filmed on the frozen lake, you're absolutely right! (Scroll to the 7th photo to check out a screenshot of the scene.) This epic scene was taken over the beautiful frozen Myvatn Lake in Northern Ireland. 
While I don't know much about cars and never truly remembered the storyline of any of the F&F series, this particular battle was somehow deeply embedded in my memory. Perhaps it was the beauty of the lake coupled with the adrenaline pumping car battle and explosions, especially the moment when the submarine exploded out the lake. ðŸ¤¯ Insane stuff I truly enjoy in action films. ðŸ¤£ 
Scroll to the end for BTS! Giant cat was not part of the scene. ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¹ Just a side note: The initial idea was showcase a lone jeep caught in a snowstorm. But I obviously changed my mind for something more ... explosive. ðŸ¤£
