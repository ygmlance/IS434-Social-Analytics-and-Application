Life in quaran-dine, feat. eats that were either made by moi, bought, or lovingly sent. Your girl’s got time so she’s going to elaborate these like it’s essential service. ⁣

a. Salmon soba dish was a complete spontaneous decision one morning after craving for the one at Atlas Coffeehouse. I’ve since made several versions (w egg and w/o) and will try one will yoghurt when my fridge is stocked. I have probably 20 slabs of salmon in my freezer since my only meat choices are fish or pork (what the doc ordered).⁣
⁣
b. Mama 王’s ngor hiang (five-spice meat dumplings in beancurd wrap). Would have tasted 💯 if those were deep-fried to deep golden brown. Air-fried it because I’m lazy af. It’s healthier, right? Special mention of Poon Nah’s chilli that’s eaten with almost anything savoury! It is also here you can witness my eunuch/food taster, Bleecker doing his thang.⁣
⁣
c. I had a craving, bought 3 bak changs, and proceeded to finish them ALL in 2 days. Still prefer the normal edition Nyonya chang (not pictured here).⁣
⁣
d. Learnt to make Korean savoury pancake. I had 3 of these the same day. The first one was made by my mom, she aced it obvi. ⁣
⁣
e. Red bean soup I made to increase blood flow post-period. Again, I am going to contradict myself saying this but I’m not a sweet tooth! I pay no mind to cakes and pastries but I do love warm beany soups, esp. the Chinese style ones. So beancurds, fu-chouk, BEANCURD TART etc. Peach sap gum, mochi, tang yuan, I love them all but consume them very rarely. Guys, I’ve quit BBT already, y’all stop harping on it. I used to drink a lot of it as a form of coping mechanism. I’m done with that life. 😛⁣

f. Bird’s nest “cocktail” for when I’m ‘bout dat lyfe~⁣
⁣
g. Mama 王’s virgin attempt at making biryani because my dad is Chinese on the outside, Malay on the inside so all of us benefited from his special order.⁣
⁣
h. Every Sat, my usual order goes: Bedok 216 morning beehoon, tau-ni, tau-huey (pictured) from Bedok Soya Bean Drink, literally. Bliss point 💯⁣

i. Bleecker doing his thang, making sure everything I make is pet-latable and chemical-free.
