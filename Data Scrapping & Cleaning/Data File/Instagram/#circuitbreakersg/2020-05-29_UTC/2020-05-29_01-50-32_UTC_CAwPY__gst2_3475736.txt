Day 50 of circuit breaker, drawing session for Leodys. I let Leodys do some drawing with Java Markers which is safe and easy to wash off. Drawing session is essential for toddler to strengthen their grasp skill. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #21monthsold #drawing #drawingoftheday #hbl #homebasedlearning #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg
