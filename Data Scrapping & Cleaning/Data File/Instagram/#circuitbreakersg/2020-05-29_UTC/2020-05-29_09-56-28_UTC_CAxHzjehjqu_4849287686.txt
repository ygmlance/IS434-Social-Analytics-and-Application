Savoury Pancakes | Switched up the pancake routine a little with batter made from buttermilk, flour and finely crushed tortilla corn chips with diced bacon, cheddar & scallion folded in. Gotta admit, the first mouthfuls felt weird, like eating a salty dessert - but after a while the sweet & savoury combination of the dish really grew on me! Definitely a concept I will revisit in the future.
