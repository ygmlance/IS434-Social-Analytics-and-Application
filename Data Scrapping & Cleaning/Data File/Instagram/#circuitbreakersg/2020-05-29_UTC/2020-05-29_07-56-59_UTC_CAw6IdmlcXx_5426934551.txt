One of the reasons I haven’t been cooking much local food is because of how easy it is to buy good ones for a good price (so the parents would rather I cook other things)

Thunder Tea Rice (擂茶饭), all the different flavours and textures, blanketed in a refreshing green soup makes for a great combination👌🏻😋
