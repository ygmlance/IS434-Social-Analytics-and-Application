This week would be some of our children's last day on their Home-Based Learning journey. 🖥️ It was indeed a challenging journey for everyone, but we managed to pull through together! 💪🏼✨ During this period, many of our parents have shared that the video sessions are what their children anticipate the most as they are excited to see their friends and teachers. We feel the same! 🥰

As we look forward to welcoming our children back to school, we are also ensuring that our centres have implemented the necessary precautionary measures for a clean safe environment. 🧼🏫 #LFPHBL #HBLSG #Preschoolsg #covid19sg #circuitbreakersg
