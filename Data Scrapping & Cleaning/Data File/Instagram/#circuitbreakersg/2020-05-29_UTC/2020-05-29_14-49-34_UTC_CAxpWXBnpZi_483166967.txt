Who needs to cook when there’s a masterchef in da house? 🤷🏻‍♀️
•
I’ve been utterly pampered with delish homemade lunches, since my hubby started working from home with me the past few weeks. His approach to the daily “what to eat for lunch” conundrum: picking a country at random and choosing to prep a dish from there 🤪
•
These are the memorable ones so far.
•
1. Kimchi fried rice 🇰🇷
•
2. Chicken curry udon 🇯🇵
•
3. Chicken curry with prata 🇮🇩
•
4. Laksa 🇸🇬
•
5. Salmon risotto 🇮🇹
•
6. Swedish meatballs 🇸🇪
•
7. Ochazuke 🇯🇵

Will definitely miss all these around-the-world lunches when I’m back in the office. For now, we’re keeping ourselves positively occupied with meal planning, grocery shopping, recipe modifications, and kitchen cleaning (me - that’s how I pay my dues 🤣). How have your wfh lunches been?
