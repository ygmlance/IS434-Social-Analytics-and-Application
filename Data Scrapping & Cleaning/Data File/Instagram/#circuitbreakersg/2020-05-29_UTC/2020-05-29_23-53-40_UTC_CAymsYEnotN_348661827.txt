Love love doing these to fix all the imbalances in my body. We tend to favor one side as our “stronger” side so when it comes to exercising, sometimes we get injured cause we overuse one leg. For me I would get injured from running or heavy lifting so I do these as rehabilitation exercises. So learn to do these one legged exercise to balance out and prevent injury. It stimulates all the major muscles in the legs – the quads, hamstrings and glutes. Plus if you want to  build up your core and butt, do these!
This is my way (so many others like using a chair, bench etc). I like using the momentum of rolling to engage the muscles. Plus I find it more fun :). Try it!
