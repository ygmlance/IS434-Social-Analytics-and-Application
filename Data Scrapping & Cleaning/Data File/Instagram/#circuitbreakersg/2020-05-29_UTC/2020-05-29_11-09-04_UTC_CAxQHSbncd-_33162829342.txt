shio pan!! making this made me happy for so many reasons haha ok firstly bc these salt bread are just so heavenly ğŸ¤¤ğŸ˜« (isetanâ€™s jap bakery one is damn good btw) crisp outside, buttery and fluffy inside!! looks and tastes like a croissant, but bread version! with more salt ofc! then next the dough was super soft to work with ğŸ¤© actly handkneaded it?? usually whenever I make bread the dough is damn sticky and handkneading is a no-go so this was a surprise!! after they were baked the crust sound rly some bread asmr ğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘Œ lastly I was q excited after trying them so some #saltbae throwing it is
