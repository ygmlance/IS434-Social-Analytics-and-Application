Check-in! 👩🏻‍✈️👋🏻 How are you feeling today?⠀
.⠀
I’m a 💚 right now, especially with the weekend in sight! Some days though, I can feel ❤️💛💚❤️💛❤️💚⠀
.⠀
🎥 @souldeelight and I are hopping onto IG Live at 9pm tonight to chat about what’s been going on between our ears and how colours and art can help us sort out mental mess 😬⠀
.⠀
🌈I’ll be reading a story about a special girl who sees colours with sound, whilst Dee will paint abstract wonders in interpretation! It’s like story-art-jamming 💞📚🖌⠀
.⠀
👂🏻I love reading your comments and chatting live, so bring your humour, listening ears and colouring materials and be prepared for ~40 mins of girl friend talk this last official CB weekend. Yes, 8 weeks have passed! 🙊⠀
.⠀
Which heart are you feeling today?

💚= All’s well
💛= Meh, I’m ok-ish
❤️= I’m not ok

Lemme know in the comments below, so I can send you love ❤️💛💚
