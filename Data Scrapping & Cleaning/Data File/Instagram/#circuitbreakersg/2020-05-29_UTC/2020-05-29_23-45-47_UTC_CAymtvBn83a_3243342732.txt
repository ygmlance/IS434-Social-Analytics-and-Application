CB Day 47 - Eng Seng First Grade Seafood - Back to the Hood! I used to stay along Koon Seng Road (where there’s sudden interest by tourists in the colourful Peranakan Houses) before I moved outta the family home. Living one street away from some say the best black pepper crab in Singapore, I used to have their crabs every week.. thanks to the compulsive behaviour of my elder brother. 😂 We’ll just call and send the helper to collect. When my brother likes something.. he doesn’t change, loyal and very predictable to the extent of regimental. One night of the week will be chicken rice night while another will be KFC & pizza for sure. 🤦🏻‍♂️😆 Anyway, Eng Seng was not just famous for their unique taste of their black pepper crab (I think there’s peanuts and shrimp paste in its black pepper gravy.. ultra good!😋), they were also NOTORIOUS for the long queues and real bad attitude of the grumpy ex-owner and his servers. I know that there was once (probably about 20 years ago) our local TV crew wanted to interview the owner and was asked to leave. ”要吃才来 不要拍 不要拍! 我们很忙!” I think the crew was shocked and left.. 🤣It was not hard to locate Eng Seng then.. just spot the crazy crowd standing along the road! Wah! What nostalgia I am having now! 🤣 Opened a Sato pinot as I reminisced. 😝I heard from a friend that there was an ownership change since 2 years ago but the Chef remained the same. I haven’t had their crabs for years.. so decided to get some for friends.. didn’t regret! The taste of the black gravy was what I remembered.. but slightly less peppery and a tad sweeter. Business was brisk despite CB! I went at 3pm and they had sold a lot of crabs already! There was a line of bags of live crabs sitting on the floor.. waiting to enter the kitchen to be cleaned and cooked. Managed to chat with the new owner and I think he liked me. He wrote “Boss” on my box and I skipped the queue! 🤪🤣I must have looked like a boss! 🤣🤪😆Kept one crab for myself and I was glad I did it. 😋👍 Boi Boi can handle the crab.. Wowo and him finished the crab.. I took care of the de-shelling department. 😭Boi Boi loved it. What doesn’t he like.. 🤦🏻‍♂😭😂
