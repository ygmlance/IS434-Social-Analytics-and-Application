IMPORTANCE OF SELF CARE💆🏻‍♀️⁣
⁣
It’s finally Friday! Here’s a friendly reminder to take time to check on yourself, be it mentally or physically. ⁣
⁣
#circuitbreakersg does take a toll on us mentally, but remember, you are not alone and we are entering Phase 1 next week🎉⁣
⁣
For us, we like to wind down with a good cup of tea in our soothing pastel BRUNO tumblers. ⁣
⁣
It’s one of our work desk essentials as the double walled stainless steel keeps warm or cold for 6 hours - we can take our time to savour our beverage~🍹 ⁣
⁣
It also has a lid which is lined with rubber to prevent leakage. No need to worry about spillage and destroying documents! ⁣
