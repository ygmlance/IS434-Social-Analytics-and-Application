~ Khao Pad Sapparod ~ Pineapple Fried Rice. Please excuse the amateur carving. Lol. I was trying to cheer up a teething and whiny younger Simlet. What's not to like in a meal sweetened naturally with pineapple juice, diced chicken breast and topped up with some raisins. Traditionally served in pineapple hollowed out lengthwise and topped with pork floss. Am happy to share my favourite Thai food with my kids. #simletseat #homemadefood #toddlerfood #sghomecooking #healthykidsfood #creativekidsfood #instafood #pineapplefriedrice #thaifood #sgmummy #sgmummyblogger #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
