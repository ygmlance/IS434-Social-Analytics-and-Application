Dinner this evening, was a couple of bowls of steamed rice, a dish of blanched spinach dressed with lard, superior soya sauce and a sprinkling of fried whitebait. Accompanying these, was a reheated defrosted Beef Rendang from Hari Raya Puasa. Tasty and satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #beefrendang #blanchedspinach #reheatedleftovers #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #sgfood #nowastemeal #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
