☁️CB Day53 - Breakfast☁️
.
Having steam char siew bao for breakfast.
.
It's a hot and humid morning again, last night thunder & lightening didn't bring any heavy downpour to the south, just light shower. .
Weather is really crazy! I need some cooling wind to come by, though impossible during the time of such months... 🥵🥵🥵
