It'll be a shame to Nutella (not tell ya) how good this is... once you (s)tart, you can't stop...

A dear friend of mine bought a bunch of Nutella Tarts from a home-based business recently and gave some of it to me as a gift. The tough circuit breaker period just got a bit sweeter. First time having Nutella Tarts and now I am feeling guilty from the over indulgence after popping so many pieces of the Nutella Tart that I lost count. The tarts are pretty good!

I didn't purchase it personally but my friend got it for me from http://sg.carousell.com/p/1008553616 and it is worth recommending in my opinion!
