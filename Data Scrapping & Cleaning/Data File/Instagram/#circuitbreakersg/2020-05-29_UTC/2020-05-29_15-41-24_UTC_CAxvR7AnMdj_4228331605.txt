Tried out their super mini squares and they are absolutely the CUTEST. Print quality is great too. Love that the paper used is slightly thicker than most. 😍

I've printed mostly food here but I think a series of welfies / travel photos / baby photos will be super gorgeous too!! You can even make a small scrapbook out of it or stick it on your walls. 🤩 .

Swipe to see my super mini-me "instagram feed" and how to use Printwich's website (www.printwich.com) from phone. They have prints in rectangles too. 😆😆
