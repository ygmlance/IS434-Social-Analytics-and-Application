Day 52 of circuit breaker (28/5/2020).
.
Thought for the day. 💬🗨🗯💭.
.
Thankful that the weather was good and I took the opportunity to exercise by walking to and fro supermarket to buy groceries. I treated the groceries as "carry weights" while walking back home. 🚶‍♀️💪✌
.
Appreciate God's beautiful nature of the light blue sky and the layers of clouds. Amazed at how the clouds formed within seconds to different shapes and patterns. It was still super hot while going to supermarket,  but the sky started to turn dark while walking back. ⛅🌦☁️
.
I observed there was a part where the strong sunlight beaming through the clouds on the left side of sky while the dark clouds gathered at the right side. .
.
It resonates with life, isn't it? We have our good and not so good, up and down times. But after every storm, we will go through and become stronger and shine brighter like the sun! 
Nothing is permanent. The not so good times will pass and better times will arrive!
.
Smile and breathe! Stay strong and determined! 
God bless! 🙏😊🤗
