Earth axis is moving/ tilting and I’m getting more and more sunshine streaming directly into my balcony even early in the morning. Not complaining at all as I love me some #sunshine ☀️ ☀️ ☀️ it is absolutely delicious to have the sun rays directly on the skin for a bit and 10-15 mins of sunshine daily is so essential for our bodies

With this, #sundayshades #sundayshadesco is my go to, to block out glare and it is superbly well fitted, no bounce and slipping even with #HIITworkout like sprawls, burpees, tuck jumps etc. I am so pleased

You’ve read thus far so I’ve got good news for you - a #giveaway is going to happen soon on my IG so do look out for it. Tag your cyclist, runner, outdoorsy friends! The awesome thing about the shades is that it not just for serious athletes, but for the casual walker, even for my mum, dad, grandparents too. Their range is diverse and something for everyone
