Been working and focusing on the same ingredients to train my sensitivities to the dough. But yet to successfully worked on my day dreaming habit. Thus I overshot the bulk fermentation by an hour!!! Hereâ€™s a slightly overproofed bake from today! 
25% Stoneground organic Wholewheat
9% Organic Spelt wholewheat
20% Organic rye/ wholewheat levain
2% Salt
7 hr Bulk Fermentation
11 hours cold retard
45 minutes of day dreaming
