Char kway Teow, a mixture of stir fried flat rice noodles and yellow noodles. An all time favourite I grew up with eating. A very popular dish in Asia and in my opinion, penang serves the best CKT paired with salted duck eggs cooking on hot coal as fuel which brings out the “wok hei”...Absolute Yums~😋 Here, I whipped up mine with whatever ingredients I can find at home during cb. 😉
