Lam's Garden 林苑 🍜This twin towers crispy noodles in superior broth with seafood from @lamsgarden0229 was delicious!! Couldn’t stop munching on the noodles. They reminded me of the mamee snack I used to munch on! Super tasty!⁣

❤️Besides their signature twin tower dish, they are also famous for their fish head steamboat which is made from a secret broth base that’s simmered for hours daily! ⁣
Another of our favourites is their curry fish head! Their curry is thick and flavorful, the fish is soft and fresh and there’s a generous amount of brinjal, ladysfinger, tau pok! Couldn’t stop ourselves from slurping on the gravy❤️❤️⁣

Previously known as Chef Lam at Golden Mile Hawker Center, they have thus moved to 371 Beach Road and now serves a wide range of Zi char dishes like clams, chicken, beancurd and many more! Check out their ig for more details- they have family promo meals 👍🏻⁣
