What’s the workout?
Street Jazz with Jasmine Ahlee

A street jazz dance class focusing on arm details, body lines, hips and chest isolations. There will be a short warm up conducted at the start of the session. It is a level one (introductory) session for people with basic dance background, and for anyone who wants to get moving and be sassy! Join me and have fun dancing to a super catchy pop song!
