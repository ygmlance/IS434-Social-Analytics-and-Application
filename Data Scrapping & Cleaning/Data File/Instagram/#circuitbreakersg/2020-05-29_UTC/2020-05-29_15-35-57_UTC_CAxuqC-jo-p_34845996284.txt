Corn soup and bitter gourd egg

On the working from home day that my schedule is really packed, I will take 15 time off around tea time to get my soup pot set up so that dinner is ready by the time I end my work

All I do is to put pork ribs and ingredients into the pot, set it to slow cook mode and it will take approximately 2 hours to be ready

I like ABC soup with corn and I can have it just with or without rice, pairing with light dish like bitter gourd egg this case

Ingredient: pork ribs, potato, tomato, carrot, onion and sweet corn
⚠️If you are particular about taste from pork ribs, boil it for 3-5 minutes before put it into soup.
