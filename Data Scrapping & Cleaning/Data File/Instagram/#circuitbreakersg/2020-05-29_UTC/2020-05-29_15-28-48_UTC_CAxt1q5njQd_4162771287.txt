Day 53 of circuit breaker (29/5/2020).
.
Detox phase day 6 : Lunch! .
Mom cooked Assam curry chicken today. I checked out the Asam curry powder and mostly all the difference spices without salt or other preservatives. So I told mom to take out a few pieces of the chicken wings for me when cooked and before she added salt. So mine is salt- free. 😊✌
.
PFC every 3:
Protein : 6 pieces of chicken wings (I didn't eat most of the skin and fats, just the meat part). 🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗
Fats : oil from the sauce
Carbs : dragon fruit
Unlimited carbs: Japanese cucumber 🥒
