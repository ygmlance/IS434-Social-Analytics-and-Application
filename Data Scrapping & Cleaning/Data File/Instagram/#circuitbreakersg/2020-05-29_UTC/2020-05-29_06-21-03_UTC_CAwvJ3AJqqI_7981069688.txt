Lee Morgan - The Cooker, 1957.  When you listen to this album it is easy to forget how young Lee was when he recorded it. As the title suggests, he plays it hot and sometimes at breakneck speed which has become a trademark of his. Unlike his earlier albums this was reduced to just a quintet, and every instrument sounding delightful. This copy is from the recent Tone Poet series and it is one of the better sounding ones in the catalog. This is definitely one to own, an upgrade or new addition cuz the music is so good and the sonics excellent. What were you doing at 19?  #leemorgan #thecooker #pepperadams #bobbytimmons #paulchambers #phillyjoejones #bluenoterecords
