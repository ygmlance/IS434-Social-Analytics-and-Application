Day 51 of circuit breaker, messy paint play for Leodys. He was given some paints to colour the ices. This activity let him experience how the paint will react when he painted on it. He also get to feel the cold ice and slowly see how it melt and blend in with his paints. As time passed, he started to paint everywhere, including Herbie. The last photo showed his final mess, where he throws all the ices out and play with it instead. Splashing and counting the ice. Having a lot of fun. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #21monthsold #iceplayactivities #iceplay #iceandpaint #painting #paintingice #sensoryplay #sensoryplayideas #hbl #homebasedlearning #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #maysatzz
