Indeed!!! The first half of 2020 has just been 😳😯😱 For us in SG, the last almost 8 weeks have been full of ups and downs in dealing with #circuitbreakersg, especially in light of last week’s announcement of different phases and predicted timings of the economy and the community opening back up again. That was quite daunting news as it just seemed like 2020 would be a complete write off, and many were so disappointed. BUT today!! We are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 🤞🏽 if our numbers stay low, we can move onto Phase 2 of exiting the circuit breaker before the end of June! That’s very exciting news, and a ray of hope 🌈! We are so ready for the new normal!
