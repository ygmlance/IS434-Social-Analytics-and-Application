Breakfast today:
Steamed “abandoned” mantou with tuna flakes seasoned w black pepper n mayonnaise. My gal didn’t want to eat these plain buns after eating just one n there’s 3 more left. I had to adopt the rest of the buns in order not to waste food. So I try to think of ways to make it less plain n more delectable 😅
