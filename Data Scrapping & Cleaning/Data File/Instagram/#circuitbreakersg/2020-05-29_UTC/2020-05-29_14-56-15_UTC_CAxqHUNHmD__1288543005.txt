Beancurd tarts from #lecafe for supper. Could immediately smell the beancurd once I flipped open the box. Put in the fridge earlier after I received in the evening and took out again at around 9+pm. The beancurd is cold yet the tart still crispy. Super delicious. Whole family approved on our first try.
