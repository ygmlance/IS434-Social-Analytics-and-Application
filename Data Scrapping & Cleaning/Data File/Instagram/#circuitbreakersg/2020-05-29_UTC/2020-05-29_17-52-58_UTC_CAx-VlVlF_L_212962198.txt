Found an old photo taken at T2 with the analog departure board. ⁣

As an east sider, the airport has always been one of my favourite hangout spots. Earlier this year, they announced that this analog board will be taken down amidst the T2 upgrading. ⁣

I’m just glad that I have this shot for memories keepsake. ⁣

What is the first country you hope to travel to post pandemic?⁣
