Not sure if it’s due to boredom or courage, I actually attempted making #croissants from scratch, and laminated the dough with butter instead of pastry margarine. 🤨My last baking (mis)adventure with this pastry years ago ended up with a horrid mess of melted butter and torn dough. 😅 I wouldn’t say it’s a success this round, but I’ve definitely grasped the techniques of lamination (patience is key). My labour of love turned out buttery, flaky, and most were gone before I had the chance to take some shots! 😎
