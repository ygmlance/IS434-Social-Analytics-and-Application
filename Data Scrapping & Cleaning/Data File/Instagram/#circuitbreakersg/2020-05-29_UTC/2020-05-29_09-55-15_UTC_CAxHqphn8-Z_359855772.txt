I told her we are making 'sushi' when we go for our first attempt on maki making (without my mum helping me 😰), but when she told her grandpa about it, he 'corrected' her that 'sushi only comes with raw fish'. So I started self-doubt and googled to confirm on the following (please correct me if my understanding is still wrong): 🍣 Sashimi - usually refers to raw fish with no rice, can also be raw meat, chicken, tofu skin or even vegetables (as long as they are served raw) 🍣 Sushi - a general word for any food (can be raw or cooked) that comes with vinegared rice (rice seasoned with salt, sugar and vinegar), and comes in many different varieties. Therefore maki nigirizushi and inarizushi are all considered sushi 🍣 Maki - sushi rolls with nori wrapped around on the outside, the filling can be raw or cooked

There are quite a lot of articles on sashimi vs sushi, so I guess there are many confuse souls like me 🤔🤭 #kpokiadiary
