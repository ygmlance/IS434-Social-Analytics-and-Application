A cool evening calls for a bowl of milky #homecooked #slicefishbeehoonsoup for dinner. The stock of the broth is a combination of chicken, anchovies and dried sole fish.

So let’s work together by #stayinghome ok? 🙏🏻#circuitbreakercookingchallenge #circuitbreakersg #鱼片米粉汤 #foodinsing #sgfoodporn #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodlover #sgfoodstagram #sgfooddiary #sgfoodsteps #sghomecooks
