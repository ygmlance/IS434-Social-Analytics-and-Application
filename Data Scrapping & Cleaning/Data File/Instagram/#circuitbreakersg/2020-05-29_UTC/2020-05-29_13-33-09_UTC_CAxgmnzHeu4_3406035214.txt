Look at that glorious tinge of homemade garlic butter. Add minced garlic to butter, add salt to butter if u are using unsalted. I also add mixed herbs to an extra oomph. Mix well, use immediately or store it in the fridge for futute use. Cost saver, and defo no preservatives. U can zng the taste to how much garlic u want also. 👍🏻😋 i like this spread with this bread, less hard than the usual garlic bread because of its air pockets. Which also means u can eat many slices of this 😂😋🙊
