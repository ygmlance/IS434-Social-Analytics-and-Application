#CircuitBreakerSG D-53

Saw some fresh Lala clams at the wet market and couldn't walk away without getting some. They had their sea salt bath the whole afternoon followed by body scrub. They must have enjoyed themselves so much as they smiled happily. Think I need a spa treatment too ðŸ˜…

Our 3-dish dinner for tonight
ðŸ¦ª Spicy Garlic Lala Clams
ðŸ¥’ Skinny beans with Haebeehiam
ðŸ¥© Mum's Vinegared Pork Rib æµ™æ±ŸæŽ’éª¨
