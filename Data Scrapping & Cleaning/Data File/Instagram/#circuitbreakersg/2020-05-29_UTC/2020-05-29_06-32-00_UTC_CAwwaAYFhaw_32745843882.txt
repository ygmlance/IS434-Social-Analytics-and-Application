All together now ğŸŒµ complete with flowers in full bloom ğŸŒ¼ğŸŒ¼ğŸŒ¼
Pattern by @yarnblossomboutique, with 5ply yarns from @craftershub_craftershub (save for the red pot which was made with 100% cotton @marrineryarns) and 3.5mm hook
My 1st time using safety eyes ğŸ‘€ (6mm), polyfill and joining separate parts together. On the latter, I undid and redid the stitches several times just to make sure everything is in harmony and the end product is not lopsided. It's still not perfect, but I got tired of redoing so this shall do ğŸ˜…
The skill level for this project was indicated as 'intermediate' so I guess that's a level up for me ğŸ¤©? I now have a much greater appreciation of the effort and hard work that goes into each pattern, knowing that making this with clear instructions is alr tedious enough (at least for me). Big thank u to all out there who are sharing their hard work for free online
Looking fwd to completing my next project ğŸŒ»
