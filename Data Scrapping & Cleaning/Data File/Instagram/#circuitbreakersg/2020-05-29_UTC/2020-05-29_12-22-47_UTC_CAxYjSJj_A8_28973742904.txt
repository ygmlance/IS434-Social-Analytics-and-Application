During this circuit breaker period, it has been a daily dilemma on what’s for lunch/dinner. Mr K was very surprised and definitely felt a sign of relief 😂 when I mentioned proudly that I’ve decided on tonight’s dinner.
.
Call me weak but who cares. I caved to my craving after I saw the pic post of the stewed Boston lobster noodles by @majesticrestaurantsg. * Mr K smiled quietly “Happy wife, happy life!”.
.
Ordered a few other delicious dishes like the kurobuta pork char siew, pan-fried prawns with sweet, sour and spicy sauce and deep-fried durian ice-cream.
