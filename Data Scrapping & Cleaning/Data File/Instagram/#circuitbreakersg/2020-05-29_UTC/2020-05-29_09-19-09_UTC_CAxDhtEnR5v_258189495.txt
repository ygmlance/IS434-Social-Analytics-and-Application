My first v-log on At-Home Korean Glass Skin Facial is up!
Now that we can't go to aesthetics but it doesn't mean we should put the beauty on hold.
⠀
🌟My home facial steps are catered to pore tightening, brightening and radiance.
👩‍🔬I used Korean medical aesthetic products and ingredients like Glutathione that are used by top skin clinics in Seoul, Korea.
🌴Steps will be useful especially if you are under humid tropical weather like Southeast Asia.
