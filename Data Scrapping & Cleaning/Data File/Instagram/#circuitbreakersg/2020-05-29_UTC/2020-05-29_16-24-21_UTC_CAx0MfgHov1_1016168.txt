#Circuitbreakersg day 53

Was it just yesterday that I said cooking at home is better? Well, we dabao-ed today. Busy sprucing up the house & nitty gritties left no time to cook. 
Happy Friday all! Take it easy, not everything is gonna unfold as U plan but  sometimes the unexpected route leads to a beautiful destination.

Dinner tonight : ðŸ”º Sunny side up up up & the rest in a tubðŸ˜³
ðŸ”ºTze char options for sharing
