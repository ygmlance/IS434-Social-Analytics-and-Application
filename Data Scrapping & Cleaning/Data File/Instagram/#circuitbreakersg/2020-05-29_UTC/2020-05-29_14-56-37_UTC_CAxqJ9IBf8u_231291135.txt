Definition of A Good Workout: When you hate doing it but love finishing it. 
If you are one of those who have been WFH and have not started doing some form of exercise at home during this Circuit Breaker, do consider starting some stretching routine or 20-30min workout to get the muscles firing up and heart rate up a little. It's great for our physical and mental wellbeing as we near the end of our Circuit Breaker and start Phase 1 on 2 June.
