Because it’s summer! ☀️ .
.
.
Been seeing posts of people having bbq meals on their patio because the weather now is perfect for dining on the patio right now. Well even though there’s no ‘summer’ in Singapore (because it’s summer all year round over here! 🤣), I decided to join in the fun. 🤣 .
.

So dinner tonight is grilled Greek kebabs and Greek salad. Love the happy colours! And btw, I really love the kebabs and salad! #gratitudediary .
