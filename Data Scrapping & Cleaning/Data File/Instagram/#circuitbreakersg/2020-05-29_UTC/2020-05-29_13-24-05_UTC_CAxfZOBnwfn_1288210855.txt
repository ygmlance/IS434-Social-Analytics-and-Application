This week we had fulfilled an order totalling 150 slices of cake in 50 cake boxes for three very generous and caring customers who wanted to boost the morale at two different workplaces.

Cakes were carefully packed into their boxes. We organised the delivery and are really pleased that they arrived in tip-top condition for the recipients. Cakes selected include Ondeh Ondeh Cake*, Speculoos Cheesecake*, Black Sesame Cake*, Chocolate Banana Cake*, Tiramisu, Triple Chocolate Brownie, Apple Crumble* and Lemon Meringue (*halal certified). All of them are now available to order online: https://wannacuppa.oddle.me/en_SG

We would like to take this opporunity to thank the keyworkers, carers and other frontliners who have been keeping Singapore going and safe during this challenging period.
