Breakfast this morning, was Braised Mee Pok with Minced Pork and Shiitake Mushrooms. Minced garlic and sliced white onions were sweat in lard, and when fragrant, minced pork was added, seasoned with a swirl of superior light soya sauce and stir-fried at high heat, until cooked. Thinly sliced reconstituted dried Shiitake Mushrooms were added with the soaking liquid, with a splash of Shaoxing wine and a swirl of Superior Dark Soya Sauce and this was cooked for a couple of minutes before bean sprouts and sprigs of Chye Sim, or Mustard Greens were thrown in and cooked at high heat. When the vegetables were almost cooked, but still crisp, sliced leeks were added and stirred in. The fire was turned off, and freshly boiled Mee Pok, or flat wheat noodles were thrown into the wok, and tossed/mixed well with the rest of the ingredients, before turning on the fire to high heat to finish off. Served hot, with a topping of fried shallots. Delicious! ðŸ˜‹ #braisedmeepok #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbreakfast #homecookedfood #chinesefood #eatingathome #foodstergram #sgfood #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
