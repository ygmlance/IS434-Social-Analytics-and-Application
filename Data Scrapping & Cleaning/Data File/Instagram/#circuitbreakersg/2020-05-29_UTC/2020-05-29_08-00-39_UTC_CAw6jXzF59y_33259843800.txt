Who doesn't love charsiu? This is a very different way of making it. But it's worked pretty well. Give it a go and let me know what you think.
.
You'll need the marinade that I posted about just before this.
.
Braised charsiu
.
2kg of fatty pork neck, cut into strips, approximately 4cm wide, 4-5cm tall, and 20cm long.
2 leeks, trimmed and cut into rough chunks
2 onions, quartered
1 carrot, peeled and cut into rough chunks
5 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
1 2cm knob of ginger peeled
1 bunch fresh coriander (a few sprigs)
1 bunch fresh spring onions (a few sprigs)
2 tablespoons cooking oil
.
One jar homemade charsiu marinade.

1 to 1.5 litres chicken stock or dashi
1/3 cup of honey
.
I In a large mixing bowl, mix the pork pieces and half of the marinade together. Let sit for around 30 minutes.
.
Preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius.
.
Heat up a large pot over medium-high heat. Add in 2 tablespoons of cooking oil. Once hot, add in the onions, leek and carrot. Stir for 5 minutes or so, just until the onion is beginning to soften. Then stir in the garlic and ginger. Transfer the pork with the marinade into the pot, add in the coriander and spring onion, and stir all the ingredients around for a few minutes. Then pour the stock/dashi over the meat. You just want to cover all of the meat under liquid. Taste the braising liquid and adjust the seasoning again if need be. Bring the liquid to a boil and cover with a cartouche made from baking paper. Place the lid over the pot and put it inside the oven for 1 hour.
.
After an hour, take the pot out, remove the lid and let the pork cool in the liquid. Once cool, you can remove the pork and place it on a wire rack, that you’ve set up on a large tray.
.
Mix the remaining marinade with 1/3 cup of honey. That should give you just enough for the basting process. If you feel like you need more, make another batch of marinade and mix it with 2/3 cup of honey.
