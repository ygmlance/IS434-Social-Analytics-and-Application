Woohoo made some egg tarts as inspired by @honeybeesweets.sg using store bought plain prata from @tyjfood! 🥧
✨
Lazy me just used normal egg custard for the filling comprising of egg, condensed milk and water. Haha simple and fuss free! The egg tarts turned out to be quite nice! Crispy, flaky with a slight chew. And I think they look like Portuguese egg tarts! 🍳
