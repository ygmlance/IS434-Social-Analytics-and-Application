But the most important thing is to start on a journey to ourselves and stay consistent,  have patience,  love ourselves,  feel good and confident from within  n a lot more. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc99 To be honest for a lot of time even blogilates calendar didn't helped me lose weight or any inches.  The only thing made me stay consistent was how I feel from within.  I'm an introvert, always hesitated to talk to people and as I said I hated my body but blogilates and pop community made  me actually start living life.  Her workouts made me feel stronger,  more flexible,  more confident and \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c hehehe more talkative \ud83e\udd23 I love to talk to like minded people and no more hesitant to speak up my mind.
