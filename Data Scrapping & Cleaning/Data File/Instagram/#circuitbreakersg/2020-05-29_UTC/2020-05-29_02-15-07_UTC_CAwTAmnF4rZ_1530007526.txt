🥐🥨𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦 𝐹𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑦!

Having this reminds me of my trip a year back in Wakayama, Japan🇯🇵. I was having the exact type of Cinnamon Raisin croissant🥐 and an iced milk tea in a random Japanese bread shop on an idyllic morning at the train station. It might seem like the most boliao thing back then, but now, it feels like a luxury no money can ever buy. How the world has changed since then...😢. Looking forward to the day that we can all enjoy the beauty of the world again🌈 without paranoia and fear. Let's stay positive that we can overcome this together by being responsible for our actions!
