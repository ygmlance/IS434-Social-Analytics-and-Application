⁣‘An Insider’s Perspective’⠀
.
On another episode of Narratives of Asia, @fibiphoebeee will be interviewing Dr Anita Soosay, a medical doctor working and living in Singapore, to discuss Singapore’s response to coronavirus: what went right, what went wrong and where we go from here. Previously recognised by the WHO for its initial virus response as the ‘Gold Standard’, spikes in cases amongst the migrant worker communities poses a challenge to its prior abilities to curb the initial number of infections without calling for a complete lockdown.⠀
