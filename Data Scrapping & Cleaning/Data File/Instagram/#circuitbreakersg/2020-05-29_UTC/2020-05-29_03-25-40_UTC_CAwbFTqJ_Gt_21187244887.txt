Book 15 of 2020 - I wasn’t kidding when I said I’d become a new fan of Chris Carter and went out to sweep the shelves of my local library for all his available titles. Yet again, I’ve found this to be a riveting psychological thriller, and one that’s not for the faint-hearted. It’s a fab installment in the Robert Hunter series and I highly recommend it. But now I think I need a reprieve from horrific, blood-tingling murders. #books #reading #fiction #crimefiction #detective #roberthunter #chriscarter #thecaller #bookstagram #novels #currentlyreading #fortheloveofreading #bookworm #booklover #bookish #circuitbreakerreads #circuitbreakersg
