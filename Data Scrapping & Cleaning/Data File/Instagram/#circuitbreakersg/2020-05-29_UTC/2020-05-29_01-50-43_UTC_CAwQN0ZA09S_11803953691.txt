Want to learn more about a different form of play and get “up close and personal” with the different types of toys? Come join us next Tuesday, 2 June at 8pm SG Time for a chat with our Founder @janicitaying and Turned-on Host @vonnylang. 
Don’t be shy, we are all here to share, learn and laugh with one another! Have a wonderful weekend and hope to see you all very soon. 🤓🌈✨ Posted @withregram • @vonnylang Are you a sex toy connoisseur with a formidable collection of BDSM gear or do you not have the faintest idea of why the heck these things are all made in the shape of rabbit ears? Either way, you may well be curious about what @janicitaying has to tell us about sex toys. 
In this LIVE zoom session, Janice will be sharing her knowledge about all types of kinky additions you can bring into your bedroom for both male and female pleasure. 
You can check out her online sex toy shop @vedosg and use the special circuit breaker discount code STAYHOME20 valid until June 1 for 20% off all purchases. If you miss that window then you can use our special Turned-On discount for 15% off with VONNY15.
