My family's go to restaurant when we want to treat ourselves to something good ☺️ .

Always got myself the truffle yakiniku don and theres a reason why that is their signature bowl 😌 Got to  try their truffle fries as well. (But will not get again bcos its so pricey for a small bowl but definitely a really good strong taste of truffle that you get as compared to other restaurants which are usually rly mild in taste) My fam fav would always be the garlic butter chicken where they give very good portion of meat 👍🏽👍🏽 Also, new on their menu is this black sugar miso unagi ricebowl set which is really nice imo and would definitely order that the next time (but sadly it is currently not in their delivery menu)

Also, swipe to see how their standards did not drop at all during circuit breaker (or actually my family felt that it was even better) when we ordered delivery online! Free islandwide delivery with over $80 spending! .
