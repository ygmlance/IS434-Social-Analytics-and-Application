Money is neutral. However, our relationship with money can turn it into an empowering servant, or into a soul-eating manipulation that drives in worry and fear. What makes one a good steward of money in a global crisis?

This week's guest speakers include Goh Zhen Zhi, @gdmorningzee, a financial planning consultant. Zhen Zhi is one who is conscientious over money matters, and believes that everyone around deserves to be able to work their passions and at the same time live a sustainable and abundant life.

Underlying this belief that she holds, lies a huge heart for people and conviction for their potential and contribution in life. .

In a time when it seemingly looks like the rug has been pulled from under our feet and stability appears to be compromised, wisdom remains the age-old friend that keeps us sound and empowered.

Raise Your Voice is a series of 12 20-min FB Live Sessions curated to build wisdom for practically navigating a new world ahead of COVID19.

With four different themes every week, we will also have guest speakers peppered at certain sessions to share insights from their different industries, backgrounds, and life experiences.

Wisdom will say that in times of peace or in waves of the storms, it is always a good time to learn.

A partnership by @theinsidespace_sg and @nycsg.
