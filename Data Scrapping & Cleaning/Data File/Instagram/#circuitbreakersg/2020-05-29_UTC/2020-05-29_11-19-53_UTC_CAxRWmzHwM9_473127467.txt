29 MAY 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 53

Day 53 - #circuitbreakersg
🥰
3 more days to official end of circuit breaker. Looking back at my daily photos, its all about art, cooking, food or snippets of what has been happening.
✍
The other most significant thing I did beside improving my cooking skill is participating in my first colouring competition. Sharing my final 2 colouring pieces for remembrance..
👫👬👫👭
We are In This Together... and hope we can Win this battle together too.
