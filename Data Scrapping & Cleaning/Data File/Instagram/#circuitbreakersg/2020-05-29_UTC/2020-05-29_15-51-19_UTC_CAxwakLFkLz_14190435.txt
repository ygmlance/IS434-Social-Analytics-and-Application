Managed to close my first deal during this Circuit Breaker period through virtual viewing! I realized that during this tough period, our job is even more required for property transactions! Why? Because we as realtors must bridge the trust between buyers and sellers. We have to ensure that all parties are comfortable with the process and negotiations and believe in our professionalism & diligence to get the work done. So to all the realtors out there, don't give up! Do your best, have faith and the right client will come!
