@bumpitybumpitybump THIS I made.

@itjustmakesmehappy I’m not convinced sewing is something that I’m going to be as enthusiastic about. Maybe I need to get more experience and understanding of my sewing machine. But it’s not difficult.

@j.yeo I did it!! Thanks for your advice.

Thank you @craftpassion for the free pattern and video! Both were very easy to use.

And now I can sleep.
