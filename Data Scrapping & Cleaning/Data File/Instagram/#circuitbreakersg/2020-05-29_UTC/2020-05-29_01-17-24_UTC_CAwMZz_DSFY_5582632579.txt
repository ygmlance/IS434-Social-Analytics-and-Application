【#circuitbreakersg Dinner】
1. Sesame soy braised chicken, mixed vege stir-fry, ginseng chicken feet soup

I was feeling lazy and didn’t feel like spending too much time in kitchen. 🤪So I decided on a “shortcut method”. I baked the chicken winglets in the oven before tossing them into the sesame soy on stove, then cooked them until the sauce was reduced😅😂 .
.
Flavours were surprisingly good! Better than 100% over stovetop. I will use this method to cook this dish in future. 😎
