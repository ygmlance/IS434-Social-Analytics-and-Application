As we count down to the end of #circuitbreakersg and enter phase 1, we must still remain vigilant!⁣
⁣
Our social initiative, Recipes For Good with @schoolofconcepts is still running and today we would like to put the spot light on: 算盘子 YAM BEADS⁣
⁣
A traditional Hakka dish, best made with your family at home. Enjoy the simple joys of coming together and shaping each beads. ⁣
⁣
It's a dish with many steps but at the end, you get to enjoy the fruits of your labour together! ⁣
⁣
For $0.99, you will get a step by step recipe, as well as a tutorial video. ⁣
⁣
You learn a new dish and we will donate the proceeds to The Courage Fund; who provides relief and support to those affected by the current COVID-19 situation.⁣
