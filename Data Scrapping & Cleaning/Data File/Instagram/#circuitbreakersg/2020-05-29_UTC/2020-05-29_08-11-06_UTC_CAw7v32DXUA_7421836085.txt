A client asked me a fascinating question today, and I think I would want to share with you.

The question is about population and wealth issue of countries and how to identify them. Below is my answer to his question.

In Feng Shui theory, there is this saying of 山管人丁水管财, which mean that the mountain governs human resource and the water govern wealth. Some example that we can see is, countries with a lot of mountains will usually have a lot of population or overpopulated issue, and countries with water surrounding it will often not have wealth issue. Another thing to take note is any state that is along the coastline will usually be more prosperous than other states that are not.

Lovely this kind of small little sharing session with my client to enlighten them on how to leverage on the power of Chinese Metaphysics.
