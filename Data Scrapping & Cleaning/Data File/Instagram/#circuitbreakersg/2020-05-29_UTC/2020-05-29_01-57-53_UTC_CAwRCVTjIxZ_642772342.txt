Easiest bread ever in the history of bread making. All you need are some common ingredients from your pantry and loads of patience to ease the waiting time ğŸ˜‰ğŸ˜‰ğŸ˜‰ This simple no-knead (yes no knead no shaping) sea salt ,rosemary & olive oil foccacia bread straight from the oven smells and tastes divine.
