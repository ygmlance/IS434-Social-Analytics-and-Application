I think I can survive having Taiwan’s tantalising streetfood all day everyday. I’m not that picky right? 😏@xie.xie_zhiwei .

This is our second time ordering from @thesaltedplumsg coz I just can’t stop thinking about the juicy and tender burnt chilli chicken. Totally seared to perfection while the sweet chilli added a flavourful component to it! Sooooo gd I wish I could dine in. 😋😋
