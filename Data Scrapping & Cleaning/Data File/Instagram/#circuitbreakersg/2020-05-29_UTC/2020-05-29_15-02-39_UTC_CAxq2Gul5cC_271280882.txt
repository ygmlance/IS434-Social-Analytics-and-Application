Circuit Breaker Day 53 🙃
Due to hectic schedule, no post for for the past 2 weeks. Now I am back. 😁
As I thought that I can't do my regular blood donation, but blood donation is still essential service for this period.
Let's give our support to all medical personnel!
Today is my 8th donation.

Circuit Breaker is ending, we still follow the rules given by the government! 
Stay Home, Stay Safe, Stay Positive 💪🏻
