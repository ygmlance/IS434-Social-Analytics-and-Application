My experience so far in regrowing #vegetablescraps.
â€¢ Shallots, in soil: Great! Grows faster than my hair!
â€¢ Spring onions, in water: So-so. The bulbs immersed in water become slimy (ugh!). Grows slightly faster than my nails.
â€¢ Cabbage, in water: Complete fail. This was recommended by a person in my FB Cooking Group to keep cabbages fresh longer. Nope, didnâ€™t work - the only thing that grew was mold.

When Daiso reopens, Iâ€™ll be getting some herb-size pots. End of the day, soil & sunlight really the best for plants. ðŸŒžâœ¨ðŸŒ±
