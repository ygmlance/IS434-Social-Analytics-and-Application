🇸🇬 CB Ends -4 Days: It’s the last #Friyay for our #circuitbreakersg! .
.

I had to place my newly bought #ficuselasticatineke in my wardrobe area as it’s a bigger plant than I expected. I painted some existing plastic pot at home with some gold paint🎨. I think the plant-pot pairing looks quite glamorous bathing in the afternoon sun ☀️ for #ficusfriday! 😍 Swipe to see the #variegated leaves! .
.
I cleared leave today and decided to tidy up my work desk area in my bedroom, that’s buried under a pile of clothes, in anticipation of longer periods of #WFH. .
.
I only managed to discard a small stack of clothes from my wardrobe, and made a mental note that no more retail shopping when phase 2 starts!! .
.
P.S: Some good news released by the government last night, indicating that phase 2 of the economy opening up may happen earlier than end June! Really happy for the businesses! 🥳
