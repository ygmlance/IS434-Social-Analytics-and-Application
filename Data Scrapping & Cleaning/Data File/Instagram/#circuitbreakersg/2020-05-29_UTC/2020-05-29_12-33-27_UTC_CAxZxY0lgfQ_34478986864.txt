Decided to do something lighter for dinner, since we already had a very satisfying lunch. So we ordered a simple but deliciously buttery pork Katsu Sando from @livetwicesg, as well as @humpback.sg's signature seafood sausage. Of course, since it's #friyay, we also got 2 of our favorite cocktails from @jiggerandponysg. These restaurants are all under the Jigger and Pony group and you can order food and cocktails centrally from their website!

Not forgetting of course the Omu rice from @chopchopbiryani that we saved from lunch (see previous post). It tasted awesome even when reheated, but could do with a bit more chicken. No complaints tho given the price!
