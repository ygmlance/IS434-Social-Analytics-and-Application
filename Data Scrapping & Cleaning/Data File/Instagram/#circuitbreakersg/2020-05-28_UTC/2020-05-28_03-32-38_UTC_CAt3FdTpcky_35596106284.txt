It is what it says - Trigger Warnings: Short Fictions & Disturbances.
.

My introduction to Gaiman wasnâ€™t this book though. It was â€˜Smoke and mirrorsâ€™ about one and a half decades ago, a book handed to me by a fellow friend who thought I would like it after a few conversations during a sociology class.)
.

Gaimanâ€™s short fictions are always a delightful bag of imaginations and wit - adventures, fantasies, magical realisms, dark comedies, insightful opinions. I suggest going for his short fictions if you feel like snacking rather than heavier meals, i.e his novels like â€˜American Godsâ€™, â€˜Good Omensâ€™... .
.
My favourites in this collections are The Man Who Forgot Ray Bradbury, Diamonds and Pearls, Feminine Endings (because of the backstory), An Invocation of Incuriosity, The Thing About Cassandra, The Case of Death and Honey... actually every piece of fiction is worthy. ðŸ’™ðŸ–¤
