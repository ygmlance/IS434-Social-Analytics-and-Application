I am 64 today. A circuit breaker birthday! Thankful for what I have now and hopeful what tomorrow will bring.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Good health and energy to help more people get healthier. These 2 months circuit breaker past by so quickly.

Grateful to God for reinforcing my purpose in health coaching, my family for their support, Herbalife nutrition for restoring my youth,Â my friends and clients for their support andÂ trust in me, my mentors Sam & Jenny for their continuous guidance and my fellow coaches for their help and friendship.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Looking forward to my next birthday. The more birthdays I have, the longer I live ðŸ˜Š
