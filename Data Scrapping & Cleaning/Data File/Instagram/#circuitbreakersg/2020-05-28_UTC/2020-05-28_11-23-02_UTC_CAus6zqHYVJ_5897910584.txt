✊😁The end of CB is getting closer as the day goes by! *punches air⁣*
⁣
But for now, we will have to be patient and work like any other day during this CB period until we can fully open our clinics on 2 June!⁣
⁣
Being a physiotherapist is very rewarding. 😇 Every part of the job from the admin work to sessions with patients, and even cleaning up makes us feel excited and thankful to be able to do what we love.⁣
⁣
In this post, you get to see roughly what it's like in a day of a physiotherapist here at Edge Healthcare!⁣
