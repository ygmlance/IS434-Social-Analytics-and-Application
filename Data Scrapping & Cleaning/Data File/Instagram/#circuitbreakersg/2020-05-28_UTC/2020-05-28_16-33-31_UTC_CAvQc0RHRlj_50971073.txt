Since i did a big big pot of stock with ikan billies, soy beans (yellow beans that we often said), pork big bones, pork ribs and pork soup bones... i use my Mui Fan for dinner... jus a few simple ingredients including the Braised Mushroom from lunch Bak Chor Mee... so so flavourful... instead of dumping away or eating those flavourless pork ribs n soup bones... i braised them... and it wasnt too bad... they manage to clear all my food... #circuitbreakersg Day 52
