Some have asked how I keep happy positive and sane living alone through these 7 plus weeks of CB (almost 10 weeks including SHN). •

Exercise is my answer 🏋🏻‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️- it helps me to pass the time, balance my emotions, release endorphins, relieve stress, see friends briefly on zoom, and also a routine I can look forward to everyday. Special thanks to @f45_training_taiseng  @yogamovement for the zoom live classes 🙏🏻 #homeworkout #yoga #YMfam #f45taisengbobcats  #f45training #StayHome #circuitbreakersg #myhappyplace #staypositive #keepsmiling #positivevibes #wegotthis •

How is everyone else getting on? What’s your go to comfort / destress to keep going during CB? • 
As we end CB next Monday and phase back into life, please remember to stay safe, and stay responsible. We got this! 😊
