A traditional breakfast of Char Bee Hoon and Ngoh Hiang.

I use to love having this on Sunday mornings when the hubs would return from dropping Mini-me for catechism. We haven’t had any since the #circuitbreakersg and seeing this appear on many local IGers post, I decided to make my own.

In times like this, you appreciate the delicious simple traditional delights that we never really think twice about. It makes you look at things we took for granted in a whole new light. .
