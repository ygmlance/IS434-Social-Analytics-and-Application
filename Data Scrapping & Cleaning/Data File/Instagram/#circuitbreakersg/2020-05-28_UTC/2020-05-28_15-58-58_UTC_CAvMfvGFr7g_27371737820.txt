[Verdict: InTerrysting👌🏻] Happy International Burger Day 🍔! If you’re looking for some quality Korean-inspired burgers, check out Burger+. Quality is assured here despite its casual, fast food setting. Think potato buns and premium American beef patties and proper American cheese.

What impressed me is that those soft and fluffy potato buns are made in-house daily. And the patties are well-seasoned, meaty and juicy. Each patty is made using a blend of cuts and weighs about 130g.

Korean Bulgogi Beef Burger ($13.80). Each patty is glazed with bulgogi sauce and there’s a good amount of bulgogi mayonnaise. You’d get some baby romaine lettuce and onions as your greens. I felt the bulgogi sauce flavour didn’t stand out as it was not very sweet.

Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger ($13.80). A bacon cheeseburger with tomato, avocado, baby romaine lettuce and homemade B+ sauce. Very good combination as the avocado adds a creamy touch to the burger.

Their fried chicken is pretty solid and I’ll share my thoughts in a separate post.

Available for takeaway and delivery.
