Week 10 of WFH. As I was having the “Braised pork belly rice” for lunch just now, I had a mixed feeling as I really missed Taiwan 😅😅 Looking back in March when hubby and I were about to travel to TPE for our short holiday trip, extremely excited and looked forward to with our flights, hotel and itinerary all arranged way in advance and in the end we got our plan canceled due to Covid-19. Now as I thinking back, it was definitely the best choice we decided not to go ahead. I am thankful for staying well and healthy with my fam! And I am very grateful for ML, our helper, who has been cooking for us while we stay at home. Today’s lunch was DIY meal kit from @miseenplace_sg and Felise requested ML to add in boiled egg and mamee 🍝 yum yum 😋 Feeling gratitude 🙏 #miseenplace #thankfulgratefulblessed #diymealkit #realfood #circuitbreakersg #stayathome #workfromhome #gratitude
