CCB Day 52/55- #DearCovid19SG ,
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
We are approaching the last few days of the Circuit Breaker. I didn‚Äôt learn how to cook. I didn‚Äôt learn how to bake. I didn‚Äôt take up a new skill. I didn‚Äôt develop a workout routine. But, what I had return is time- sth that we have been neglecting and taken for granted in our daily lives(past).
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Time when I finally caught up w all the old shows like DOTS from years ago cuz watching shows are the least priority in my life as it‚Äôs a waste of my time to me(once you start on a show you can take 2-3 FULL days to finish it).
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Time when I get to eat 3 meals/day cuz my new WFH colleague(dad) ensures that we eat every single meal or more that I grew fatter.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Time when I have seen my parents more than ever in my lifetime as compared to the past.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Time when I get to tidy my wardrobe, mask my face, and just sleep the entire day a lil more often as these used to be my lower priorities.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
I‚Äôm always on a constant hustle- whether it‚Äôs work or out for dinner/drinks after work or cafe hopping/finding activities during the weekend or travelling during leaves that I never felt like I have a proper rest till now.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
I‚Äôve never felt so rested. I‚Äôve never felt like I have more than enough time to do every other things that are at the back of my mind.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
I know this ‚Äúbreak‚Äù is a privilege we will never have again once life resumes.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
So, thank you for gifting me time üï∞
