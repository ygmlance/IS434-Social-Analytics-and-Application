Today marks the day we finished all 279 episodes of The Big Bang Theory during #circuitbreakersg. ðŸ˜­ We caught it backwards â€” from season 12 to 1. @mikelimch can finally stop complaining I messed up his mind.

Just glad that we can continue to learn about Sheldon Cooperâ€™s life through his narration for Young Sheldon.
