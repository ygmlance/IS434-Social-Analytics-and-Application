Honestly, it is just so difficult to get my hands on bubble tea this circuit breaker (limited amount produced in a day, expensive delivery fees etc), so I thought why not go for alternatives?

The Thai Milk Tea was so fragrant I have nothing much to comment on 😂 It is what you imagine it to be
.
Their boat noodles are at $6 a bowl, really affordable for a restaurant, and the portion is huge. I couldn’t finish it 😂
.
Also, all self pickup orders are entitled to 25% off, including the $6 noodles!! I got a shock when I saw the receipt 😂👍🏻
