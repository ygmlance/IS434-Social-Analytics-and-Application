Book 14 of 2020 - Chris Carter is truly the master of delving into the criminal mind. I was in turns terrified, creeped out and morbidly fascinated by the gripping details and the edgy ride that this book is from start to finish. I only discovered him this year, but he’s already my new favourite crime fiction author. 🙆🏼‍♀️ #books #reading #fiction #crimefiction #detective #roberthunter #chriscarter #anevilmind #bookstagram #novels #currentlyreading #fortheloveofreading #bookworm #booklover #bookish #circuitbreakerreads #circuitbreakersg
