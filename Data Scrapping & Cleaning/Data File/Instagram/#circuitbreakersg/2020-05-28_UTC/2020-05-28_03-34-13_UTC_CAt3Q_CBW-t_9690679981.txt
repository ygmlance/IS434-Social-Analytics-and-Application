APPLY APPLY APPLY, big part of econs right? So how to apply for PED & PES, for what purpose? ⁣
⁣
These are for market stability/ fluctuations questions, also can be used for evaluations. Not smoking you, ok.⁣
⁣
👌Always draw steep or gentle demand/ supply curves. If you don't need PED/ PES, then draw 45 degrees lines.⁣
⁣
So you probably know or memorise that when PED or PES is price elastic, there will be greater quantity changes as compared to price changes; also when PED or PES is price inelastic, there will be greater price changes as compared to quantity changes. ⁣
⁣
🤷‍♀️BUT how to draw and show?⁣
⁣
I am using just demand and supply decreasing, there are other variations depending on the question. 👉Oh, remember 1 big 1 small too. (relative shifts)⁣
⁣
🤜The simpler one first. IF DD is price elastic and SS is price inelastic, what happens to price and quantity when DD & SS decrease? ⁣
⁣
There is little chance for you to mess up this diagram if you drew the curves steep and gentle and also included the relative shifts.⁣
⁣
🤜🤜The tricky one now. WHAT IF DD is price inelastic and SS is price inelastic, what happens to price and quantity when DD & SS decrease? Try drawing this. UNLESS u drew the curves VERY STEEP and really showed the relative shifts, it will be difficult to show that the price increase is greater than the quantity decrease. TRY, ok?⁣
⁣
There are just too many combinations for you to memorise every diagram (32 if I am not wrong). Understand the tricks to draw DD/ SS diagrams and you can master these. CAN?👌⁣
