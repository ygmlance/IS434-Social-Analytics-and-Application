As we continue to reach out and contact our patients to schedule for the 2nd June reopening, we also want to reassure everyone that we are taking every care to reopen safely.

Making sure we clean and disinfect the clinic, wiping down all high contact areas.

We are also taking measures to schedule our patients apart(by appointment) to prevent overcrowding in the clinic. And also by minimising the number of people allowed in the clinic at any one time.

And of course, all patients will need to scan the safe entry qr code before they are allowed to enter.

I wish everyone well and can't wait to see you all again next week! #staysafe
