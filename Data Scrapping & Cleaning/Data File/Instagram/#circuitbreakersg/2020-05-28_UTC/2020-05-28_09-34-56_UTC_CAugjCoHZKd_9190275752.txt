TLDR; MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE DRINK IS BACK💕
———————-
When Playmade started collaborating with food brands for delivery, I was quite sad to find out that Orange Pulp Green Tea wasn’t on the menu 😭 But hey now it’s back, so I quickly placed an order 😂
.
The drink was filled to the brim even though I ordered no ice (in case the ice diluted the drink during transport). Pearls were also packed separately so there was a lot of tea!! They were also extremely generous with the serving of pearls 😍This volume could fill about 1 and a half of my huge ass bumbler cup.
.
No idea why the colour was darker than usual, and the tea was slightly more sour as well. Should have gotten 70% sugar and it would have been perfect!!
.
FYI: Orange Pulp Green Tea is not a free option if you order the food & drinks set meal. I topped up ~$3 for the drink and ~$1.20 for the pearls I think.
