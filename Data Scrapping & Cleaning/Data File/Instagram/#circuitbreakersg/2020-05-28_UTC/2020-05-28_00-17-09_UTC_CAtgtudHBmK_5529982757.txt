Everyone has a must-order item when it comes to dim sum. Chee Cheong Fun is mine! It has always been my staple and favourite #dimsum item. Itâ€™s been my obsession trying to find the eateries that get the texture of the #ricenoodle just silky right. One of my favourites is the neighbourhood coffee shop dim sum #kimlydimsum . This is the traditional Hong Kong-style, which comes with soy sauce and fried shallots with spring onions. Pure heaven. (after a couple of tries we have decided their other dim sum donâ€™t make the cut ðŸ˜“)#breakfast day 52 of #circuitbreakersg
