Annyeonghaseyo!
Today I’m bringing you to Korea and serving two korean dishes 🇰🇷.
One is the classic dish which is Kimchi Jjigae (Kimchi tofu stew) and the other is Beef Bulgogi (Korean grilled beef) wrapped with lettuce. 
These two dishes are so delicious and easy to make. It’s a great dinner. 
Enjoy your meal! 😋
