Lou Donaldson - Blues Walk, 1958. The recent reissues Alligator Boogaloo (80th) and Mr Shing-a-ling (Tone Poet) put the spotlight back on Lou Donaldson, who seem to have shaped the soul jazz movement of the 60s and 70s. Blues Walk is still the album that kicked it off for him. Its interesting to hear a straight forward bebop album infused an R&B feel. Early days yet but we know where Lou took it. The ballad Autumn Nocturne is one of the sweetest I’ve heard. If there’s just 1 Lou album to own, this will be it.  #loudonaldson #blueswalk #hermanfoster #peckmorrison #davebailey #raybarreto #bluenoterecords
