A simple lunch of Fried Rice with prawns, luncheon meat and eggs. This time, I tried a method which I  saw on Youtube where the eggs are mixed with the rice before going into the wok. A lot of eggs were used with the rice but strangely, it doesn't look as yellow as what I saw in the video and it also seems the eggs had disappeared. ðŸ˜‚
