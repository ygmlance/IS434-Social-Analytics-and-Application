Happiness and a full tummy on "circuit breaker" day 52... Courtesy of a good friend, we were extremely lucky, grateful and hungry recipients of @burntends_sg divine sanger and the grissini & Taramasalata... The sanger was loaded with so much pulled pork that even the meat-lover @iamivanlau said, "Too much meat!" I'm not complaining one bit!  The Taramasalata was on point!  Loved it!  Thank you! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
