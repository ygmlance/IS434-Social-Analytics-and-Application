Happy Birthday my very first coach! 🥳Had a chat earlier with him and it felt like it was just yesterday when I was accepted to be trained under him at 12 years old. Honestly my life will be so different if it weren’t for you taking me in to do hurdles when I was 12 😍 I wouldn’t be a sports person if it weren’t for you. Where I am today and the successes I’ve got wouldn’t be possible without you. I will forever be grateful to you 🙌🙌
