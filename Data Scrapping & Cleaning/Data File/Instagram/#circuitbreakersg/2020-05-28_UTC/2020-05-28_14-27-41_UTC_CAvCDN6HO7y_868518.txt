Our first time having chapagetti even though we've had chapaguri many times. 
Supposedly a quick dinner fix since it's instant noodles but I just have the knack of complicating matters! 😅 Sautéed onions for tossing with the noodles and panfried mandu (Korean dumplings) as a side dish. 
Thankfully my kitchen assistant's conference calls ended early so he could help me out.
