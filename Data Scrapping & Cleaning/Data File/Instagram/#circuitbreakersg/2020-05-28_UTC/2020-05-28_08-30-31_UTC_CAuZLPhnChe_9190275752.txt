We all know how difficult it is to get our bubble tea during CB, so when I saw free delivery I immediately jumped into it 😂
.
The milk teas are 3 for $11, and the only customisation option was for toppings: pearls, jelly, or none. No choice of drink, no choice of sugar level
.
Drinks have to be preordered before 4pm, and they will start their contactless delivery from 5pm onwards
.
The tea was alright, pretty similar to the old school $1 tea you’d find under your block. However, what wasn’t fine was the pearls 😭 They were so hard it was difficult to chew. I assume most of us get bbt for the pearls and if you are, you’ll be pretty disappointed if you ordered this, considering it’s ~$3 per cup ouch😭
.
I really appreciate their pay-it-forward campaign for frontline workers, but I really do hope they will look into their pearls recipe 🙏🏻
