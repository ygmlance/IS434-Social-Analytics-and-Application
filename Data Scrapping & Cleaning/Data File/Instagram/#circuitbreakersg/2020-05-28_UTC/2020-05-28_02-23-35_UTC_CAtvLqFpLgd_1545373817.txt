Today’s tea break: Double Fantasy from Chateraise. It’s a puff filled with pure Hokkaido cream n vanilla custard cream, a double cream puff. Hence the name “Double Fantasy”. My photography doesn’t do justification to this delicious puff with super smooth double cream. I am posting the professionally taken pics off their FB page that truly reflect how good-looking this puff is really.
