We're looking for people willing to be featured on a video sharing their experience during COVID-19!

If your plans have been disrupted by the pandemic, you've dealt with any unexpected changes, reconnected or strengthened relationships due to COVID, or have found new hopes (like maybe having a baby!) we would love to share your story.

This includes organisations or community groups who have launched new initiatives or have had to adapt to the circuit breaker.

If you're interested, you can find out more and submit your story at bit.ly/StoriesofCOVID

Feel free to nominate others as well ðŸ˜Š
