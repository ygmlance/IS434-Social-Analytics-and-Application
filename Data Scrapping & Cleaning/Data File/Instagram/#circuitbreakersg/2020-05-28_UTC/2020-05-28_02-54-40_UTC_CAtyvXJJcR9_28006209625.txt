| Social distancing |
.
.
I sincerely pray that when all this is over, we will understand that social distancing is but a way of maintain certain levels of hygiene. I pray that we do not start to wash our hands of those who are less fortunate, or that we alienate the poor, or shun the weak in the name of "social distancing". I pray that our hearts will not turn cold and unfeeling towards those to cry out for help. I pray that the fear of the disease will not manifests in fear of helping one another as fellow human beings. 
I pray that social distancing only occurs in the physical realm. That while we need to be physically apart, we can chose to be even closer at heart.
