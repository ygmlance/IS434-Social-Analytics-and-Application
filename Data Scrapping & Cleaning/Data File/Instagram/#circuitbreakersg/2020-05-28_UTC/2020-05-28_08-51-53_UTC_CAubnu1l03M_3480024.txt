Cir Breaker Day 52 Tea Break.

Good news today as we registered no new covid-19 cases for Singaporeans and PRs. Hope the day will come soon when we have zero cases for our foreign workers as well.

So back to food, we are having the bak kwa chiffon cake from @foodyo_cafe for tea break. The cake uses 100% natural ingredients with no preservatives or chemicals. It's soft and fluffy despite of that, and the lovely bak kwa smell is evident right away when we opened the box. The taste is really nice, a good balance of light sweetness from the cake and fragrant saltiness from the bak kwa bits. 
I'm really quite impressed by it, and at $12 for an 8 inch cake, it is very reasonably priced. I would love to try the other 3 flavours, which are pandan, gula melaka and sweet potato.

You can order the cakes from www.chophupchong.com.sg along with a whole other range of food products from their sister brand Chop Hup Chong. Just buy up to $30, and delivery is free! .
