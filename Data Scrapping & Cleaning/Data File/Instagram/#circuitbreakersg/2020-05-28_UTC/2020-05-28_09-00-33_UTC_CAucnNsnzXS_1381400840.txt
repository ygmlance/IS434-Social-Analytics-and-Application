Kudos to our staff for going above and beyond in their duties, working tirelessly through the circuit-breaker period. ðŸ’• As a form of appreciation, Chris Chong, Managing Director of Retail, CapitaLand Singapore, and the retail management team presented packs of fruits to over 900 staff across 15 CapitaLand malls.

With Phase 1 Safe Re-Opening drawing near, we remain committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of all shoppers, tenants and employees at our malls. Stay safe everyone!
