✨Update: Watch the episode on my IGTV! Jump to 05:00 to skip the technical glitch at the start 🤦🏻‍♀️
.
We're doing it again! 👯‍♂️ Episode 2 of the #PositiveDeePeilin show 🙈⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Two weeks ago, Dee and I got together for a TGIF night of laughs and ice-breaker questions 😂⁠ (evidence still on IGTV 📺)
.⁠⠀
Tomorrow night, we're combining powers with a storytelling and art-jamming session together 📖🎨🖌️ I'll be reading one of my favourite children's storybook, The Girl Who Heard Colours, whilst Dee will paint her interpretation of the story 🌈⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
💡 We came up with this idea as we were chatting about mental health and what we've been doing to ride the waves of uncertainty 👩🏽‍⚕️👩🏻‍⚕️We're clearly not psychiatrists, although Dee here is a certified art therapist, so I’ll be picking her brains on what that is and how art can help us 🤓⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
🌈 We are broadly going to be chatting about colours and mental health since its Mental Health Awareness Month and we’re living in a weird season 🎨🤯💬⁠⠀
.
Feel free to join us with your paints or glass of wine, whichever way you are inclined! 🍷 Set a reminder for yourself on your phone now, or click on the reminder in IG Stories 📲⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Tomorrow, Friday, 29 May, 9pm on IG Live! ⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
