Iâ€™m not a hot fan of mac n cheese actually until someone passed me this recipe and ask me to try it . Oh boy it really changed my impression , golden crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside . Whatâ€™s good about this is that the recipe is very flexible such that ingredients in the recipe can be easily substitute with another.  Hereâ€™s the link for those who loves to give it a try ! ðŸ‘‰@mrsvitale https://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/mac-and-cheese/ #stayhomewithascott #stayhomestaysafe #stayhomeandcook #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #homecooking
