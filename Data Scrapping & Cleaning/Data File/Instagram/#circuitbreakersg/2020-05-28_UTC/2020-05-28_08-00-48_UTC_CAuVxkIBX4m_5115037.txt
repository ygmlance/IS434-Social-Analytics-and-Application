Homemade chinese pork jerky (Bak Kwa). I used to think it must be extremely difficult to make Bak Kwa because of how expensive it is during Chinese New Year ðŸ§§. In reality they are pretty simple to make and you can customise the flavour to your likingðŸ’•. Never thought of making this at home until my son was craving for it. #bakkwa #homemade #chinesejerky #snack #sodelish #sgfoodphotography #foodphotographyandstyling #sgfoodies #sgeats #quarantine #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
