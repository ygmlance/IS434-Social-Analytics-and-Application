*Teach a person to fish!*
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
A few people in my extended family are teachers. I’ve also discovered that  many of my customers are teachers too 😍😍😍. So a big *thank you* to the teachers out there who’ve been continuously putting time and energy into other people’s kids while, for some of you, managing home-based learning for your own kids. And a little shout out to my dad @keenmingh for somehow managing to impart critical thinking, unquenchable curiosity and wide-eyed wonder that translate into the things that I design.

This mask is part of a bigger repeat order than a teacher put in with me  and as part of her order, she asked for two half-and-half masks. Thank you for allowing me the freedom to suggest a totally different combination from what you initially had in mind, and I’m really glad you like it.

I love the proverb “give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime” because I believe in learning. This fish print has been on mind mind for a while as perfect for a teacher, and yesterday I dug through my stash of fabric and uncovered this chevron in the same colour family, that reminded me of water. Water. Fish. Teaching. Teacher. 🤗🤗🤗 You guys might know that I love fabric prints that tell a story and I love this story because teaching and learning are  what I believe in.

School’s starting soon and I’ve been told it’s different - even speaking through a mask requires more energy. Thank you for sharing your stories with me and thank you for trusting me with the things that you need. Thank you for guiding the next generation along their learning journey.
