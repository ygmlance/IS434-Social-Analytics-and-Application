Yay itâ€™s chilli crab and steamed chicken wings for dinner! ðŸ¦€
âœ¨
First time cooking chilli crab ourselves. Mum made the spice paste from scratch by blending together garlic, onion, ginger, shallots and dried chilli. Fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce are then added during cooking. Add in beaten eggs at the last stage and itâ€™s done! We used flower crabs from @9sseafood which are so fresh and sweet. Served it with rice and air fried mantous from @justdoughsg for the complete chilli crab dining experience! ðŸ˜œ
