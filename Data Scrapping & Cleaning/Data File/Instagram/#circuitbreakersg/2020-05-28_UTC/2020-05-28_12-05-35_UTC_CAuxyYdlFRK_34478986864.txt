Guess we weren't tired of #japanesefood, in fact posting about my meal yesterday made me really want #gyoza today! So I ordered a double portion of 🥟, along with black garlic pork #mazesoba, grilled chicken, and wagyu steak, from the @aburien.sg nearby. The portions were pretty small but filling enough.  Hubs gave the food a big thumbs up 👍 (it's our first time trying this restaurant). Personally I found the dishes a bit too salty for my liking, but for most of them you can add the sauces to taste, so it's not a problem. Certainly a flavorful meal! They are on @deliveroo_sg, @grabfoodsg and @foodpandasg.
