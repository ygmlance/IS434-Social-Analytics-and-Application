Posted @withregram â€¢ @belbuttons Do you Nyonya Mee?
.
This is another traditional dish and each Peranakan household have their own variation but essentially it consists of garlic, salted beans and either pork or chicken as the base of the broth and a few extras.
.
The supermarket apparently ran out of cucumbers, so thatâ€™s definitely missing.
.
I paired it with homemade grilled Chicken Satay and a spicy Peanut Sauce that kept us dipping.
.
Nyonya Mee always brings me back to my teenage days when my mum would serve this in her Corelle Morning Blue pasta bowls - she actually still has them after all this years ðŸ˜† talk about lasting quality!
.
Anyways, I prefer variety and Corelleâ€™s donâ€™t break so since Iâ€™ll probably going inherit it or something ðŸ˜† Iâ€™ll stick to the â€˜othersâ€™ for now. Still liking this design from @tablematterssg
.
Todays broth was from my winnings @foodyo_cafe @hupchong , definitely worth considering. .
