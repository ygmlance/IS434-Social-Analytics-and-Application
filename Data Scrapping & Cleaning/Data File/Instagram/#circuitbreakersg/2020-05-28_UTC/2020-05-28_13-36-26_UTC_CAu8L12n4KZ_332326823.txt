Happy International Burger Day! Today we put the spotlight on our classic Grub Cheeseburgers 🍔

Made from 100% fresh mince that’s always chilled, never frozen (Boss is super strict on this 😝!) so the patty retains its juiciness and beefy bite. 
Our burger buns are made from 40% French butter and a natural yeast - they are soft to the bite, but can hold up against the juicy patty 😋

The Double Cheeseburger 🍔🍔features 2 x patties, 2 x cheese and has an added rash of bacon. It measures around 5 inches tall!

Order these at www.grub.com.sg/delivery or pick up at @grub.balestier. Free delivery islandwide for orders above $60. Limited delivery slots left for the weekend!
