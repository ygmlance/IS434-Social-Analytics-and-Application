I know it must feel terrible if your Birthday falls on a day during the Circuit Breaker Period in Singapore. You can't go out to your favorite restaurant to celebrate the day with your friends (more so if your family is not in the same country as you), eat your favorite foods, drink your favorite poison and most importantly, giving hugs to the people you love and who loves you too.

So it is a great idea that our cocktail bars in Singapore have thought of innovative ways to bring their menus to our home. And @theotherroomsg happens to be one of the birthday girl's favorite bar. Although it is not the same as meeting the people and enjoying it together physically, the very yummy cocktails (2 portions) and the snack that came with it, made it easier to bear the distance. Of course seeing the faces in zoom call helps too.

Thank you @joyexploringasia for the treat, and happy to see you still get to receive all the birthday love from home. Pssst...please make space in your fridge for my gift delivery later. ðŸ˜† They do not deliver on Wednesday and I understand it is bad luck in your culture to receive a gift before the actual day.
