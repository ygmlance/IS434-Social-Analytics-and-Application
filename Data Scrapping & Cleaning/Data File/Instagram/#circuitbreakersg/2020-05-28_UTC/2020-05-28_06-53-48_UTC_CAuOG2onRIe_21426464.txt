These questions always take me back to when I was 20, a few years out of high-school sitting in my bedroom and pressing 'record' on my Logitech webcam (remember when webcams weren't built into laptops?) 🤣🤪⁠

If I can be completely honest with you.. I didn't plan for things to unfold the way they did.  I saw a need at the time and I knew I could take meaningful action; despite how small and naive it was at the time - I kept going based on the lessons I learned, the failures I had to pick myself up from and constantly looking through the lens of 'growth mindset' before it's become this buzzword.  I learned on the job, I read as much as I could and joined conversations I didn't understand much of when I first begun my work in community building. ⁠

I believed that if I could just do what I could, with what I had, wherever I was...it meant more than just becoming an armchair activist or a keyboard warrior.  I didn't want to just talk about solutions - I wanted to play my part in being the solution together with others who stood on common ground.  I was fuelled by my passionate anger at the inequalities and injustice I read about, heard about or witnessed. ⁠
