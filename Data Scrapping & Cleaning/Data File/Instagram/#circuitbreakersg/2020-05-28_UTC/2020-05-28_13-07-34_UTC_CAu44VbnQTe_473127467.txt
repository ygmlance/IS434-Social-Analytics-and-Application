Day 52 - #circuitbreakersg
✍
Feeling tired today... so maybe that explains why the drawing also abit darker. Body seems to be functioning yet feel pretty zone out.
🕖
Managed to squeeze an hour to do another quick sketch + a short video on how I do my shading. I think in time to come, it will be lovely memories to look back to.
