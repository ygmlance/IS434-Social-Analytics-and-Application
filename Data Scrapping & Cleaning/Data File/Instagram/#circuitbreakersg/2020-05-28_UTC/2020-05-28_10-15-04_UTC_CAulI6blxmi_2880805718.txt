Athleticism üí™üèº
‚Å£
"Athleticism is the ability to repeatedly perform a range of movements with precision and confidence in a variety of environments, which require competent levels of motor skills, strength, power, speed, agility, balance, coordination, and endurance." ~ NSCA definition

There are other definitions, but a common thread is that athleticism is a multi-dimensional quality. While different people have different views of what these dimensions entail, I would say that the more physical dimensions you excel in, the more athletic you are.

We all know that someone who seems to take to any sport like a fish to water, and is able to perform above average in most physical activities. The good news is, anyone can  develop athleticism by working on its component physical dimensions.

In my opinion, a key dimension of athleticism is the ability to run fast over a moderate distance, repeatedly. The faster and further you can go and the more times you can do it, the more athletic you are. So sprinting/striding is absolutely essential if you are looking to become more athletic.

These videos show me and my wife being put through our paces - my torture is self-imposed but hers is externally-imposed (by me). Running fast is one of the most useful physical abilities you can have, and one of your best defences against unexpected dangers. ‚Å£

My dad used to make me run between 4-7km daily before I even entered primary school. He was a firm believer in athleticism and I have him to thank for getting an early start to physical training. My running ability has served me well over the years, so now I'm imparting it to my wife as well to increase her survivability haha.

Want to look and perform like an athlete? Then you've got to train like one! If you aren't already doing so, try incorporating sprints into your workouts, along with some accessory leg work like squats and lunges and you'll feel a good difference in 3-4 weeks. Get on and get moving!
