This ain’t a sponsored post for @cloversoft but we wldn’t mind of coz as we trust only Cloversoft wet wipes. This month, we see our lil one sinking her teeth into ANYTHING she lands her hands on and here is an innocent capture of her before she sunk her teeth into the @cloversoft wet wipe pack. 
Today, our lil one turns #8monthsold. Though it has been tough working and looking after our kids, we are thankful to the family time during this #circuitbreakersg, to be able to watch Tasha grow and reach each lil milestone. She is now trying to crawl, lift her butt up, kneel and trying to stand with help. These would not have been possible if we were at home and so hubs and I are really thankful for these precious rare moments. 
We LOVE it that Tasha is always so camera-ready with her wide smile that makes you smile and your heart warm, or at least, mine. We hope that she stays this happy and healthy each day of her life. Cheers to 8 months and the many more brighter days, months and years ahead, our precious Tasha! We LOVE you ❤️🥰😘.
