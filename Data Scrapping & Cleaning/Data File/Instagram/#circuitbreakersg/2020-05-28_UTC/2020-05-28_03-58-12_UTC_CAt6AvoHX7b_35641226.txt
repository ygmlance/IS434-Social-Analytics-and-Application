One of my favourite zi char noodle dish - crispy noodles' or 'sang meen' or 生面! In Singapore, mixed ingredients is known as 什锦 or 'sup kum' but in Australia, they call it 'combination'. #uselesstrivia

This is another cooking #achievementunlocked for me - I'm definitely coming out of this CB (sounds salah! 🤣) a better cook, just like many of you! 🤭

What about you? What new dish did you attempt in the last 50-something dish?
