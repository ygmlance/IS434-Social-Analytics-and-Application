Have you ever wonder why the market is rallying when the economy is bad? 🤔

On Black Monday (9 March 2020), U.S. stock markets went into a frenzy amidst Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war and escalations in Covid-19 woes. 🙍‍♂️ By 23rd March 2020, DJI fell 37.09%, Nasdaq fell 30.12% and S&P 500 fell 33.92% (in total) from their all-time highs. 🤯 Today, stock markets have started picking up slowly even when Covid-19 is still rising and countries are being locked down. Every crisis is an opportunity in disguise. 👏
