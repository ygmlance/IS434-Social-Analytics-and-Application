[Serving Made-to-Order Drinks — Fresh from the coconut husk 🤗🥥🏡]
•
Featuring my favourite drink, which is also their must-try signature drink @mr.coconutsg! Coconut Shake 🥥🥤(M $4.40, L $5.40) is a delicious concoction of vegan, dairy-free and healthy! It is also fragrant, refreshing, and great for hydrating in this hot climate 🤩👍🏻 I usually go for 0% and topped it with coconut ice cream (+$1.20) to give it a cooling and satisfying finish 😋

They are currently offering online islandwide delivery but limited orders daily at https://order.mrcoconut.sg/ , with minimum order of $30 + $10 additional delivery charge. I did the math for you, that's about 7 cups of Regular-sized Coconut Shake = about a week's supply great for this stay home period 😄 Or enjoy FREE delivery for orders above $65!
