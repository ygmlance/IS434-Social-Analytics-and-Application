3 months & counting still living lockdown life.....
.
I honestly can’t tell if it’s getting easier or harder at this stage, probably both.
.
Keeping it real, maintaining a positive outlook and being thankful for what we have.
.
Seeing friends in other countries slowly come out of lockdown and return to some form of “normal” living is gona be tough...
.
What’s everyone missing the most?
.
I’d murder a decent steak & wine combo at a nice restaurant right now...... 🥩 🍷
