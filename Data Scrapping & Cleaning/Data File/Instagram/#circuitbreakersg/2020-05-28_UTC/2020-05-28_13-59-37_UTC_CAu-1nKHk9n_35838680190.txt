"We know that things will continue to tough for cabbies still, but having already extended full rental waiver for the last 2 months, we are unable to do so for a third. We hope that 50% rental waiver for June will, however, help ease some of their financial load." Just yesterday, I was told by our PM that no one should be left behind as we tackle this pandemic. But why do I feel so alone just like this cab with no one to stand united with? ðŸ˜©
