Dear Ashley, happy 18th month! In the past #circuitbreakersg month with you, there was an explosion of language. You are able to express yourself more with simple words in english & chinese. Practical life is still your fav as you mop/sweep/wipe with more purpose & start to help us out in the kitchen 😊 You are constantly running around with your older siblings, learning all stuff, whether #momapproved or not haha. You love food, or simply love eating at the dining table with us, i am not sure 😄

As you continue to grow in your toddler years, start to say lots of “no”, “misbehaving”, testing limits, i am reminded to constantly love you for who you are. Not just loving the happy days with you, but also the tiring, draining days. Just like your current fav book, “I love you through and through...yesterday, today and tomorrow too.” 🥰
