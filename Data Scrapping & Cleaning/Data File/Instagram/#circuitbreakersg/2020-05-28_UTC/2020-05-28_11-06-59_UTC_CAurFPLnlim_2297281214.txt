I'm often spoilt for choice at Ghim Moh Market... This hawker centre, next to Old Airport Road Food Centre, is one of my absolute favourites... Here I can find one of the best chicken rice, beef hor fun, yam cake, crystal bao, apom, Hainanese curry rice, Thai pork trotters, shui gao and wonton... Another recent fave of mine are the tea cakes from @theheadlessbaker that are almost too pretty to eat... I picked up an assortment of tea cakes for @pangszewei's birthday... Coffee, Earl Grey lavender, choc bundt and pandan tea cakes... Sooooo yum!  Any excuse to support our Singapore hawkers! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
