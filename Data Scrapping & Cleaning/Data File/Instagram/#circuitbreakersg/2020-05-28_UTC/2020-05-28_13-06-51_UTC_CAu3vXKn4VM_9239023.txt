OH GOSH. Creating gifs is hard work. BUT ANYHOOO, neckache aside, this doodle is the first of a #CVCwords series!
.
Children learn to form sounds into words using CVC (Consonant-vowel-consonant) words. Children start to blend letter sounds to create a new word. EG c-a-t : cat
.
So the last letter of the first #CVCword is P. The theme is kitchen  equipment - FUN!
