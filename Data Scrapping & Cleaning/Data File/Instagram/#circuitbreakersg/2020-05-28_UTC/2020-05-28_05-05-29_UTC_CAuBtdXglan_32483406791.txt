So...... these are leftovers from last week so I thought I’d just do a quick mix and match for lunch.

This is probably some bastardised fusion but it’s nice. So I used the Italian sausage with some salad greens and tossed in some 刀削面 (Dao Xiao Mian or Knife Cut Noodles) and jellyfish. Added some chilli oil and Mala spices.

There’s no recipe for this. 🤣 I was just looking in the cupboard and seeing what I could add.

If you’re feeling adventurous, you can try it, and share with me what your results are like! ✌🏻 #刀削面 #knifecutnoodles #cookedbycarlsson #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakercookingchallenge #workfromhome #workfromhomelife #foodvlog #foodvlogger #foodiesg #sgunited #sgstrong #stayathome #stayathomechallenge #stayathomesg #homecookedfood #homechefmeals #homechef #cookedwithlove #stayhomeforsg #chinesecuisine #fusionfood
