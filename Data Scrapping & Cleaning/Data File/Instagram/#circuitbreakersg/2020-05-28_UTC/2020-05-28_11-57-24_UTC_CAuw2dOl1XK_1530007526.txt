🍜🌶️🄻🄰🄺🅂🄰 🅈🄾🄽🄶 🅃🄰🅄 🄵🄾🄾 for dinner tonight. The soup was easy enough to make... Just add water and coconut milk to the sambal paste and boil! 😂

The soup was quite lemak and since 1 packet was less than $2 compared to a more expensive brand that comes in a box packaging, I have to say it was pretty worth it. 👍
