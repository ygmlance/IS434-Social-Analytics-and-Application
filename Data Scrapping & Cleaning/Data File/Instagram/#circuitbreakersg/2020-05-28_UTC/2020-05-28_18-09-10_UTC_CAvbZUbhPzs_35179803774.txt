[THE MASK ADAPTER]

Handmade crochet mask adapters to ensure snug fit for earloop masks 😷

I first made this for my Mum bcos she had trouble wearing earloop masks when she had her hijab on. This helped connect the earloop on the left to reach over to the earloop on the right at the back of her head! I then found that my daughter had a need for it too because her mask didn't fit well. I made a smaller one for her and voila! (Swipe for photos! 😁) Kindly DM us for the yarn/button colours available!
