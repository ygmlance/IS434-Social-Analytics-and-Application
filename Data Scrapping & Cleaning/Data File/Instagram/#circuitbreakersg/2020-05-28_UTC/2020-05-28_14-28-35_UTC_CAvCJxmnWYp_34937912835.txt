One of the greatest politicians of the 20th century and one of the greatest Asian Politicians of all time, Lee Kuan Yew was the force behind the creation of the South-East Asian super state of Singapore🇸🇬 After WW2, knowing that Singapore could not rely on the British🇬🇧, he championed independence with Malaya. After being kicked out by the Malaysian Federation🇲🇾, Singapore became truly independent and under Lee’s stewardship, faced hard tests and many storms ahead.

He used the only realistic resource available on the island (people), to create a manufacturing sector for electronics and lifted hundreds of thousands of people out from the poverty stricken shanty towns and villages into urbanised public housing🏡. By investing in infrastructure🏗 and education📚, Singapore was able to attract investment from multinational companies like @generalelectric and @hp 
By the end of his life Singapore had risen to be one of the richest countries in the world, with its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita rising from US$428 in 1960 to US$52,962 in 2016, a year after Lee’s death. 
Lee did not succeed by his sheer will, but instead surrounded himself with like-minded and talented individuals like Dr Goh Keng Swee, E.W Barker and S Rajaratnam, building a multi-racial team to reflect the diversity of Singapore💯

Here @futureleaderx, we pay tribute to a man who through his vision and determination, helped turn a tiny island covered in swamp to a prosperous metropolis🌇
