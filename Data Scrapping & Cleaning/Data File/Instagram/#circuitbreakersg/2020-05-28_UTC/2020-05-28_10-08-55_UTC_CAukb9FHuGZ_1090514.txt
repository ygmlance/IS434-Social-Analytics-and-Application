My first attempt at sushi. In my opinion, it’s relatively easy to make, but very difficult to master. There are so many variables to consider, from the rice, the type of ingredients used, the ratio of every element, etc. But I suppose the old adage rings true: practice makes perfect! .

It’s great for parties, picnics, and outings with the kids, so it’s definitely something I hope to have a better grasp of, which means, more of these in the days ahead. My poor family, haha!
