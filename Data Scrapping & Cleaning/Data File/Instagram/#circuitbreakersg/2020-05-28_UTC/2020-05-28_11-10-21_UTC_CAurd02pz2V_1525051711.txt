#circuitbreakersg is almost ending and heartfelt thanks to @snapasksg for helping my kids and me sail through the HBL and school holiday revision.
.
We have been using this app for a few months now. The most loved feature for me has to be the INSTANT availablity of the tutors. Whatever is the question or subject, the tutors are always there to guide us through the problem solving. They explain well step-by-step and are patient enough to ensure the understanding of the students and parents. .
We intend to explore more features of Snapask once the school resumes. Will share more with you, meanwhile my promo code ""shubsnapask25"" is still available to get 25% off your first month subscription! .
