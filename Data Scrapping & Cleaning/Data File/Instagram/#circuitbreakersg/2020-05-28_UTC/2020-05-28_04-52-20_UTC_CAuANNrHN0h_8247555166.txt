Yay got some seasonal Sakura and matcha snacks from @donkisg! 🍪
✨
Pocky Sakura Shitate - Love the delicate floral notes of this. It’s sweet, slightly salty and a little milky, but everything harmonises well and it’s really enjoyable. The shade of pink is so lovely too, even the pretzel sticks have a pink tinge to them! 🌸
✨
Pocky Koi Fukami Matcha - Wow the matcha notes for this are distinct, but it’s quite sweet and the cream is quite milky for me. But I really like the rich matcha taste (though not the super intense kind). I think this is probably one of the best matcha Pocky! And yes even the pretzel sticks are matcha flavoured, but the matcha taste is definitely more prominent in the cream! 🍵
