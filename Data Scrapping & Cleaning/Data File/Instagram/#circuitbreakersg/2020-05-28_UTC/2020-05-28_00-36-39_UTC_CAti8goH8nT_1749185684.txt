Day 24 Hols = Day 52 of #circuitbreakersg 
Squat Lunges
#7daythighchallenge with #blogilates
Day 1 of 7 Day Stay Home workout with #heatherrobertsoncom 
Adjusting to wake up earlier today.. Pushing my body alarm.. Today I had 2 workouts for the thigh challenge and its really a killer! I hope I can survive.. The small movements are really the most painful but effective. 
And guess my leggings showed the name of one of the exercises in the 10 min Beautiful Thigh Sculpt.. Can u guess? 
And did the Day 1 Stay Home Challenge with #heatherrobertsoncom again cos its a great burn! (this video is the 2nd circuit out of 3 circuits in the video, Tuesday, I featured the 1st circuit)
