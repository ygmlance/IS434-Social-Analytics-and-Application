Meet the lovely Amber, owner of @theheadlessbaker located at Ghim Moh Market... I chanced upon her cake stall while buying lunch one day... I'm so glad I stopped to pick up some cakes as she makes the most amazing tea cakes... And this is coming from someone who doesn't love cakes... Her Earl Grey lavender cakes are sooooo yummy and her lemon cakes are to-die-for!  Keep an eye out for my next post where I will be sharing more pics of Amber's yummy cakes... Please support your local Singapore hawkers! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
