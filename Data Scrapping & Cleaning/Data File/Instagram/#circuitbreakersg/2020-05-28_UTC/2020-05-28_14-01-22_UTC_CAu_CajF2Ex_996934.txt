#circuitbreakerday52 x Mandatory Leave Day 9 // This @thebakehaus.sg #croissant was amazeballs - nicely layered pâte feuilletée, crispy flakey exterior, and the unmistakable aroma of good butter. #painauchocolat and #almondcroissant really good too for breakfast + lunch + tea with an increasingly diluted cups of @kapalapi_id’s #floresmanggarai, while panic-mugging for this evening’s possibly grilling/gruelling session on #galatians.
.
Unfortunately, after an entire day’s work, have managed to get stuck at only, err, the first 2 chapters... .
Paul’s proto-McLuhan (or just common sense?) diatribe is fascinating. It’s simultaneously extremely personal and of universal significance. .
In Galatians, he defends himself against false brothers not because of ego, but more crucially because the messenger and the message are intricately linked.
.
.
Another proto-McLuhan issue (or just good lit-crit technique?): what to make of Galatians being a letter written in Roman times (not Times New Roman) and is there significance in the opening and closing parts of such letters?
.
Edit: after this evening’s session, perhaps there is...
