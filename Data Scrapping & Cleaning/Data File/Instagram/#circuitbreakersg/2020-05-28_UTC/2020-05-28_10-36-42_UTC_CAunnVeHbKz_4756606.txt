Day 52/56•Stayhome Dinner 
Not sure if you feel bored seeing our Sukiyaki hotpot dinner appearing so often 😅 This is really the @yeoolofamily 's fave and now Kbros only want udon (instead of rice) whenever we cook sukiyaki!
Super glad we bought @brunohotplatesg Ceramic pot attachment 😍😍 #mamaberlcooks
