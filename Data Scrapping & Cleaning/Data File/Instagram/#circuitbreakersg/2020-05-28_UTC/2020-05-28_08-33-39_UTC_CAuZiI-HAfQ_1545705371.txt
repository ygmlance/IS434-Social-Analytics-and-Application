Kudos to all of you launching a new business right now, despite the global situation. Honestly I donâ€™t think there is a good or better time to do so. After all it depends on how you position yourself to beat the noise and stand out from the crowd. â €
â €
Given that you are a woman on a mission, who not only knows herself and the unique service or product you offer, but furthermore who you offer it to. â €
