Day 50. Many of my friends are in denial that there are only 4 more days to go office. Most have been too used to work from home. Getting more rainy lately and yes this is mainly due to the monsoon. Breakfast - heavy in proteins and fruits, with omelette as the main course. Dinner - pork sukiyaki, comfort food for wet weather. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #instadaily
