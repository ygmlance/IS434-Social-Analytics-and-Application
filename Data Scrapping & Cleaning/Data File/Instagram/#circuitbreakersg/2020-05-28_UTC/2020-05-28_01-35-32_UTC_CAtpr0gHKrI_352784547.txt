Last day to get you @cafecocosg #cocobox ,to celebrate their 1st anniversary, all proceeds from the sales of these brews will go to #sgredcross to help the local vulnerable elderly amidst the COVID-19 outbreak✨I got their coco bundle that comes with their limited edition cherry blossom latte😍🌸 which is really pink! It’s super milky with floral nodes(slightly too sweet for me though) but perfect visual and taste pick-me-up in the morning🌞
