#Circuitbreakersg day 52

It may seem like we are cooking everyday but this CCB made us realize that eating at home yields healthier options at lower cost. 
It has however, turned me into a very naggy auntie. Complaining this is expensive, that is expensive ... ðŸ˜‚

Dinner ala Mexican style (of sorts): ðŸ”º Slow cooked pulled pork made with root beer
ðŸ”º Apple slaw ðŸ”ºTomato soup made with tomatoes, onions, celery, carrots & lotsa herbs ... wholesome goodness
ðŸ”º Rustic Apple pie as we have flour, butter and too much green apples turning soft  It came out a little burnt.. I guess 1 minute earlier would be great. ðŸ”ºCinnamon sugar sticks made with leftover wraps ðŸ˜… quite yummy as a snack ~
