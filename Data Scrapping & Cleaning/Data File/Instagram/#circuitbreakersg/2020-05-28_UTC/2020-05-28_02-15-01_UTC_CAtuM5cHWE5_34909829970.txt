Today’s SUPER breakfast is seriously the #breakfastforchampions and it’s dedicated to my SUPER friends @eunice.yoga.finance & @toystory92 for sending over bread care packages during the #circuitbreakersg period.

I love fresh bread, but I also love overnight bread because it can be repurposed into MANY things. French toast/bread pudding is just one example! Today I’ve two types of overnight French toast because I hate wasting bread, so I used @breadstorysingapore coffee loaf as my base for French Toast, with super crispy almost crouton-like chunks of healthy multigrain bread from @gurunicebakery to get the best of both worlds in one dish. No kidding - it’s chewy, crispy, soft, crunchy, all in one. 
Dipped in @fnnmagnolia Brown Sugar and Sea Salt flavoured milk that I have been DYING to try but couldn’t even catch a glimpse of in supermarkets. Luckily it was @lazada_sg @redmartcom to the rescue yesterday when I managed to secure a delivery slot. 
Swipe to see the process pics and some fail drizzling video 🤣

#dEATs
Overnight bread soaked in milk + egg mixture (preheat oven to 200C and bake both sides for 4 mins, remove the small chunks before turning the large ones over because they will get burnt faster - they’ll alr be crisp at this stage!)
@lindt dark chocolate for some epic melt action while the toast is still hot from the oven
Greek yogurt & @finestfoodsg blueberries
@maranathanutbutters peanut butter
@theoatberry dark chocolate granola
+ a cute @littlefreddiesg monkey biscuit cos I’m a monkey by birth🐵 hahaha it’s not just for kids to enjoy!!!
WHAT A BOMB BREAKFAST!!! I’m so pumped for the rest of the day thanks to this 😍
