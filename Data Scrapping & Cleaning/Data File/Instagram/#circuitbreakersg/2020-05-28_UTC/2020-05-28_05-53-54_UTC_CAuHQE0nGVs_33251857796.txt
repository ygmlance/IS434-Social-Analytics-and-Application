#farmtofork adventure this circuit breaker! 😁😁 Making use of the unlimited sun & breeze for our mini #ediblegarden since windows are always open now with us at home.
.
What surprises me is how veggie scraps from our cooking can grow so easily & quickly! We even managed to grow & harvest our sweet potato leaves to cook sambal sweet potato leaves 阿公番薯叶 in a matter of weeks. 😋

SmartyPence Tip 💡 
Try growing your unused veggie roots at home! Cut off the unused roots, soak them in water until they sprout & then transfer them into soil! 
What has grown so far easily:
✅ Spring onion ✅ Sweet potato ✅ Mustard seeds✅ Xiao Bai Cai .
I love how the garden is always in a state of change & growth, a reminder of what we should strive for everyday even in times of hardship. Something to look forward to every day & it is a fun activity for those with kids! This is definitely cheaper & easier than growing flowers 😁
