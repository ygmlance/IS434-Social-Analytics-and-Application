Physique checked! 💪🏻
.
I was struggling to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to an overscheduled lifestyle and that led me to being physically unfit and mentally exhausted. I did not know how to prioritize my things, and schedules were cramped with daily routines and errands. Eventually, I lost my motivation to do anything.

Now, I'm back on track! I'm happy with how I look and I feel great about myself! 💁🏼‍♀️
.
