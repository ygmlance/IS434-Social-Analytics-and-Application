Throwback Thursday!.
. 
5️⃣ days to "Safe Re-Opening".
. 
Embarrassing and awkward throwback!! It's been a little over 3 years since I first overcame my own fear and publicly post a video of myself talking to the camera.

Even today, I'm not comfortable reposting this video but I think it's a good reminder and lesson. I recorded more than 20 videos before I felt this version I was most comfortable to post..... I pressed the POST button despite my fast beating heart and sweaty palms. Clicked and quickly get over with the nervousness😅. Although I'm still not yet a professional presenter but I feel less afraid to record and post.

Sometimes when exploring or doing something new, it's necessary to just do it and figure out along the way than be paralysed in over preparation and ensuring it's the best.
