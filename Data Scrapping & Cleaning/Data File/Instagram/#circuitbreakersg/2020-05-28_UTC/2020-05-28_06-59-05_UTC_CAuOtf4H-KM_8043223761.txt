When there's no rainbow in sight, we create our own rainbows in the comfort of home.

It's amazing that we managed to stay at home for close to eight weeks without losing our sanity. We depended on online shopping for groceries and necessities, and also spent a lot on food delivery when we didn't have time or energy to cook. Other than that, we had a lot of fun time together as a family and came up with ideas and creative ways of spending time at home.

As Singapore enters Phase 1 of the post-circuit breaker period from next week, school will resume for the kids. Are you ready for Home-Based Learning (HBL) and daily classes again? I am not sure if we are mentally prepared for the chaos when HBL resumes. ðŸ˜… But we look forward to the light at the end of the tunnel where we can embrace the rainbow which awaits us at the end of the storm. ðŸŒˆ
