✅⛔️Ready, Get Set, Match the Shapes! 🟡🔷◻️♥️

If you have a young boy like me, you’d probably have figured out that one of the best ways to engage them is to add some physical component to the learning activity. My 20 month old toddler, J, loves to run about. He simply cannot sit still. Thus, on days that he is extremely restless, I try to modify his learning activities to incorporate more movement. Works like a charm every single time! 💯

Since we were on shapes and the DIY shape sorting box I made a few weeks back required him to sit still (see previous post!), I modified his shape sorting activity by printing and laminating shapes and their names on paper and sticking them all over the house. I then got him to pick out a mystery shape from a covered box, name it, and search for its corresponding wall sticker! We had so much fun doing this activity; he went for another 3 rounds after completing it! 🌠
