Mixed feelings that #theAteamSim is returning to school on alternate weeks
.
There were moments when I felt undeserving of them yet other moments when things felt easier without them
.
They have grown a little more during the cb.  One grown chubbier, both grown wiser that adulting isnâ€™t that great and comes with big responsibilities
.
This one cleaned (that explains the vacuum cleaner) and packed bag on his own accord. For this, he was praised for being the sensible, big boy that mama loves so much
