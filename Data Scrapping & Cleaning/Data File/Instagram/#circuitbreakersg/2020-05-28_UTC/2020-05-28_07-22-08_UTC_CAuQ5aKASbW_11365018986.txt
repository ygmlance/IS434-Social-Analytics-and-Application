What benefit would that be for you if you attended a class and got nothing out of it? 
For regular practitioners, and especially those who had attended Pilates Core Strength charity virtual class on Monday via @fittogethertv I would like to implore you to start considering “WHY” have you chosen to do Pilates, and “HOW” has this practice benefit you in your daily lives, whether in performing your sport better, better energy levels or even more mental clarity.

I had emphasized 2 principles during class that would help you stay connected with your own body to perform exercises with better success. Which are these? Comment below! (You can make an intelligent guess even if you weren’t in class!) The first 3 correct answers stand to win a FREE virtual group class! 💓
