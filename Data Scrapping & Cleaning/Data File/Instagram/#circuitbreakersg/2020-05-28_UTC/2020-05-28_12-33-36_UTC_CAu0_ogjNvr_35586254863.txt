*my opinion if you want to argue fuck off, doing this because of the constant news of racism-caused deaths*

The US has really fallen from the heights of its past glories. From being the world’s leading country in everything to become an absolute shit hole that other countries laugh at. The US is not the majestic country it was where the eagle of freedom flies high and any immigrant that moves there will suddenly become a millionaire. You’re more likely to get assaulted, kidnaped, and forced to worked 20 hours a day making Nike shoes for spoilt 10 year olds.

1. Lots of my fellow students have huge boners for going into US universities such as Harvard, Cambridge, etc. Sure that’s great! You can meet other nerds there and drown yourself in beer and boobs in their college parties. THEIR EDUCATION IS NOT SUPERIOR TO OURS. A degree from Harvard looks impressive but who gives a shit in this modern day. They’ll always be a 9 year old kid from India smarter than you anyway. The US education is not better than Singapore’s, there is no need to travel there just to study.

2. Blatant racism is prevalent in the US. Sure, there’s racism everywhere but at least Singapore does a good job of hiding it from the public. The orange faggot in the White House just fans the flames of the angry inbred Farmers waving pitchforks at any other races. The idea of white supremacy is so deep rooted in their system that any problem must be other people’s problems. Oh, that 15 year old kid is Asian! He must be responsible for locking me up in my house! I can’t go out and fuck my favourite cows now, let’s beat the shit out of him.

3. In the US, it’s a good day if you don’t get mugged or raped by anyone. Crime is so prevalent there, it’s a wonder that their population isn’t dying out. But ofc, all the murders are of black and Asian people anyway. I mean, they’re worthless aren’t they? If they’re not white who cares about them.

This better get more likes I spent so much time on this shit.
