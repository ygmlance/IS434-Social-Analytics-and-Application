Woke up for work only to realise I was a whole hour early so might as well kill a super short circuit (<45 mins including a 5 min jump rope warm up) before clocking in!☝🏼😁 ➡️➡️➡️➡️4 exercises to work mainly on full body and core. ➡️➡️➡️➡️ 3 rounds of:
🔹Jump rope * 100 rounds
🔥single arm downward dog * 5/side
🔹Banded and paused lateral hops * 15/leg
🔥seated leg raises and hold * 12-15 reps 🔸rest :10-20 secs in between exercises, 🔸<2 mins between rounds

The ones with the fire icons 🔥 are moves that I’m trying out for the first or second time. For me, taking on new exercises meant working with my body’s capability to perform it. I usually do 1-2 sets first to figure out 1) if I can do it 2) If I can do it well if not at least with decent form to avoid injury 3) If I can incorporate it into a circuit and make it as challengingly fun as possible. ✨✨✨ #orininjagojer #liftlobbyworkout #circuitbreakersg #bodyweight #triedandtested
