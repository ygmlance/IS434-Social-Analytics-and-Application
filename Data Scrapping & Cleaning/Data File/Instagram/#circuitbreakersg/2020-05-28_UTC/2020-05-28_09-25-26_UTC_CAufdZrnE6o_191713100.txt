🕢Dinner:Kimchi Fried Rice 🇰🇷🍚
Kimchi Fried Rice, aka Kimchi Bokkeumbap, is a fried rice dish made by stir-frying Kimchi and rice together with some seasonings. It’s a classic Korean comfort food that’s made in households across the country to use up leftover rice and overripe Kimchi.

Keeping my ingredients to the very basic, a bowl of fried kimchi rice that is ready in 10 minutes with tons of kimchi, eggs, rice and fried garlic slice.

These fried garlic slices have definitely turned this simple humble Korean dish alive !
