It’s our wedding anniversary and if not for the CB, @kopikosonggirl would be on a holiday like in previous years. It’s ok! Coz we are all safe and healthy and our parents sent us a celebration dinner that they ordered from @TungLok!

Obviously way too much food and they still wondered if it will be enough. They ordered from Xihe Peking Duck coz they know their granddaughter loves the duck! (We also like lah, but grandparents always think of grandchildren right?) Food was still hot! Label says it is ready for consumption at 6pm. Food arrived 20 mins later! We realised the waxed paper boxes have perforated cuts, so we cut it off and hey it looks nice. Thanks parents again for the dinner! Hopefully we can dine together soon!
