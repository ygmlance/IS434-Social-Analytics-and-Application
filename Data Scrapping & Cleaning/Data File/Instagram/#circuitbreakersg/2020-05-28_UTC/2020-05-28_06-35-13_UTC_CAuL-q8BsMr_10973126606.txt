What's your favorite festive cookie? SnapBurp loves Pineapple Tarts!

Featuring Nastar Cake | B$4.90, a Raya Special Edition from @coffeebean_brunei, made with pineapple jam, cream cheese frosting, shredded cheddar cheese, nastar crumb and nastar cookie pieces!

It was more on the sweet side but would be great with a cuppa black coffee.
