Activity Thursday:🎨🏃🍳😘 #1: Craft - We put into practice the craft tips that we gave last week. Check out the video on our Facebook page and see our supervisor ensuring that the designs are of top notch quality! 
#2: Remember the Zombie, RUN! mobile app that we introduced? Joey has been exploring it and was able to clock in 3km after a long long time of not running. But the stats aside, having a storyline while running/jogging does help in taking Joey's mind off the fatigue. How about you?

#3: Always thought poaching an egg was difficult? The trick is to just start with 1 egg first, test & adjust the timing for your next egg. Slow & steady does it!
