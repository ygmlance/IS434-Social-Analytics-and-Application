So I wrote a simple Blues tune over Circuit Breaker (for our overseas friends it’s SG’s fancy term for #stayhome ) which premiered at the World Lindy Hop Day SG Celebration on Zoom, which I heard didn’t come across clearly so here it is me singing and playing it again, awaiting the day #therhythmakers can play this and I can focus on singing and dancing! 
Circuit Breaker BluesWe can’t dance like we used to, we have the circuit breaker blues (x2)It’s time to work those limbs now, and get our hip-bone looseWe can do the thing we once feared, we call it solo jazz (x2)We can keep it really simple, or do it with some flashWe can do the boogie forward, and then the boogie back; we can do some Shorty-Georges, and then the fishtails backAnd then some Camel walks with them  Apple Jacks,and finish with some badass rhythmic break stepLet’s all do the thing we now love, some real cool solo jazzWe can’t dance like we used to, we have the circuit breaker blues (x2)But it’s fine cause we know how, we’ll let the solo jazz loose ——— Do check out the earlier IGTV post on the short tutorial for the dance steps during the stop time segments of the song!
