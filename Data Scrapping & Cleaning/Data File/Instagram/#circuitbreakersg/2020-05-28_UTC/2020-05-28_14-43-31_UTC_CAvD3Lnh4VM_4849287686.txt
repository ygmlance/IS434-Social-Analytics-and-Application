Chicken Katsu Sandwich | A healthier take on an iconic Japanese snack. Breaded butterflied chicken breast using the 3-step procedure of flour-egg-panko before air frying them. Tip: partially pre-toast your panko to ensure the end product is nice and golden. These air-fried cutlets are so versatile - can be used as a side dish for mains like yakisoba (e.g. previous post), curry rice or for sandwich-lovers like me, wedged between basic sliced bread (though Japanese milk-bread will certainly be best) with tonkatsu sauce and shredded cabbage.
