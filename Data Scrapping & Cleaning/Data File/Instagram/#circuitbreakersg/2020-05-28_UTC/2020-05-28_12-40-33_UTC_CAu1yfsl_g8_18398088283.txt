... Our parents have been patronizing LE Cafe since we were young and we grew up eating their bean curd tarts, cakes, moon pies, pineapple tarts and many other pastries☺️ The bean curd tarts remains as our family favourite, especially when they’re served chilled! Forget about egg tarts and dig into these bean curd tarts, couldn’t resist and we ate one first! The old-fashioned cakes comes a close second and makes for a good tea time snack🤤
