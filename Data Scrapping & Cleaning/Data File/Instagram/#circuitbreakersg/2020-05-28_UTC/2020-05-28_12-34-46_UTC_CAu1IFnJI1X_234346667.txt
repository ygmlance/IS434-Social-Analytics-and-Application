【Recipe】Yes my favourite kind of dinner...homemade curry 😍😋 我爱吃咖喱 🍛 #honeybeecookssimpledinner 
Served with turmeric garlic butter rice and some blanched Choy Sum balsamic vinegar and top with crispy fried shallots.

Cooked Turmeric Curry chicken again and made some changes to the rempah. And yay! It turned out better then I remember it😍😋 Or maybe I’m just too hungry 😂 好好吃的咖喱
So I’m recording this new formula down haha. 
There’s no curry powder, no chilli powder or some weird seeds 😂 Trust me, it’s yummy. #honeybeecooksturmericcurrychicken ——————————————
