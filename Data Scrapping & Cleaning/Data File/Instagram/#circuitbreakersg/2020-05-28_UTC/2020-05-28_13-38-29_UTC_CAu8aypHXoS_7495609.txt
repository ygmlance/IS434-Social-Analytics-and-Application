Krabi was the last place we spent time with the kids’ daddy. We had our last breakfast in the hotel before daddy sent us to the airport cos he need to fly back to overseas for work... we said our goodbyes & still harbouring hopes that we could meet in SG after a few weeks. But this darn Covid-19 just got worsen... & the rest became a history...
.
It has been almost 3 months now & definitely it is going to continue for another 2-3 months before daddy could come back. The kids started from missing him dearly & sometime #louisateo would even cry because she “missed papa too much” while #charmerteo Kor Kor just keep his feelings within him but I know he misses papa too... @three_teos tried to video call them daily but kids still kids, it is very difficult to chat on phone! .
Whatever it is, this virus is gona stay for awhile longer, & we can only pray that things will get better but definitely not back to what we use to be...
