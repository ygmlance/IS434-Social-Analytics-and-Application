TLDR; Taimei, being one of the longest standing Taiwanese snacks stores in SG, rarely disappoints 💪🏻

One day I had a strong and irresistible craving for bubble tea during this circuit breaker so I went and dabao-ed from I Love Taimei. Seems to be the only place with bbt open for pick up near my area.
.
Customers are only allowed to buy drinks if they get food. 1 set of food = 1 cup of drink, and one person is only entitled to 2 sets of food max. Regulations have to be put in place in case Singaporeans start hoarding bbt like toilet paper, huh?
.
Indeed, most of us need our daily supply of bbt regardless of the season, so there was a wait of about 20 minutes for the food and drinks. Also, there aren’t that many choices of drinks available. Wanted Choco La Creme but none of the Creme series was available.
.
Got the fried chicken (oh yesss) set with sides and bbt. The white pearls really go very well with non-milky refreshing drinks. I think this was recommended by their staff. Not too sure, I forgot. What I do remember was their staff being pretty friendly and polite despite the long queues and orders. 💪🏻

Decent drinks, love their fried chicken, slightly on the pricier side but aren’t most bubble teas expensive af? 😂 Many times I find that they are closed on GrabFood  in my area, perhaps due to overwhelming orders. Maybe take a short walk over to their outlet to pick up your food if it’s possible!
