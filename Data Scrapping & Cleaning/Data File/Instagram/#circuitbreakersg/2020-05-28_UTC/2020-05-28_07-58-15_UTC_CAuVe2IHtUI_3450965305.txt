Don't know what kind of board games to get for your pre-schooler?? Why not make your own?!
.
.So yup... I did a mini board game for the big brother and we played for a little while yesterday too!
.
.I included things like spelling and counting in some steps to make him learn something as well, while playing! I even included for us to spell out our names before we can start playing! Hehehe~ This way, I can make him revise spelling his name because he always runs away whenever I ask him to!
.
.(P.S I'm gonna add a "pick a card" and maybe include some simple  Chinese words recognition for him to do along the way as well ðŸ™Š)
