Fabric masks 😷 are now the essential part of our lifestyle. 
We can't step out without putting one on as mouth and nose are now considered "unseenable" features of humans. 
Keep them covered and stay safe!

Thank you for your orders and trust in me for playing a part in your essential lifestyle.🙏 #jesshandmadestudio #handmademasks #fabricmask #diymask #covid19 #circuitbreakersg #staysafe #stopthespread #madetoorder #handmadesg #handmadewonders
