•Sponge cake •
Fancy something original yet tasty? We tried out this receipe and it is by far the fluffiest and moist cake we have ever eaten  We refrained from putting any toppings to show you its most original state! We used a rice cooker/pressure cooker instead of an oven to complete this receipe and it turned out pretty well!
Flour mix was a star buy ! It was convenient and fuss free
