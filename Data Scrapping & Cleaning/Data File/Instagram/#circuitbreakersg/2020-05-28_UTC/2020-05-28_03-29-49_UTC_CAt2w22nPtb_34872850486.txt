My penchant for brioche bread...The light, fluffy and buttery taste makes it stands out from the commercialised bread in the store. Toast it with a little butter on your pan to get a light crisp. I have it here with crabstick, egg and cheese. Delish and satisfying! 😋🦀🥚🧀
Need: •Crabstick (shredded or cut to small bits)
•Mayo
•condensed milk
•cracked pepper and a pinch of salt
*measurements based on your own taste.
•any types of greens (I am using local lettuce) u can add on tomatoes, cucumber too.
•brioche bread (easily available from any renowned bakery)
Method:
•Toast your brioche with a little butter on both sides. •mix all the other ingredients together with the crabsticks (except the greens).
•Assemble them together and enjoy!
*i added a fried egg with cheese melted on top as I do have not tomatoes. It just gives depth and enhance the overall tastes. Give it a go...I’m sure you’ll love it as much as we do.
