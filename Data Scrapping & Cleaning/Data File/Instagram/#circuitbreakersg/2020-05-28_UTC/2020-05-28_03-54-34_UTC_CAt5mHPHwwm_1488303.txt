However Vera still craves going outside and she has been such an Angel staying at home. The only place we can bring her these days is to our private neighbourhood park. She gets to see birds, trees and enjoy a light breeze. She also needs to get her dose of Vitamin D. This is very important for bone health. 🍖🌞⛅

Vera has mild eczema and when it gets hot and sweaty this itchy skin issue comes up. Malaysia and Singapore gets really warm in the tropics eventhough out walk sessions are usually in the early morning or evening. We used to mostly use our Bugaboo stroller in the malls so it doesn't get too warm. To my surprise this COOLING stroller seat liner works REALLY WELL. 🌀🌀🌀I used to see her get irritable when its hot and she feels sweaty but because it feels so cooling and comfortable she can really enjoy our walks together.🏞️👶🤱

The padding is soft and the 3D mesh keeps the seat cool and dry. It is really easy to attach and compatible across strollers.

The bonus part is it is machine washable, so if food or liquids get onto it, its super easy to machine wash.💧💧💧
