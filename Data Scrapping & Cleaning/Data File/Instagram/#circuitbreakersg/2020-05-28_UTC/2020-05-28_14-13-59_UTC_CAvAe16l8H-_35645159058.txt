Glazed or unglazed? Have it your way! From now until next Sunday (7 Jun), all brownie orders will come with a free mirror glaze sauce for you to pour over (otherwise $0.50 a portion). Each brownie retails for $4 only! If you want to see how we dispense the glaze, swipe ðŸ˜‰. We use hospital grade syringes to dispense them into zip locks to ensure the highest level of hygiene in our assembly line. 
P.S. we really did not expect that much enquiries within 1 day of launching this page. Thank you so much! Weâ€™re fully committed till Saturday, you can DM us if youâ€™d like more information, or to place an order for Sunday onwards. Menu, and FAQs will also be uploaded soon. In the meantime we will answer any of your questions via DMðŸ˜‰.
