I recorded our conversations so that I can remember your stories. I recorded videos of you so that I can remember you. Holding on to what seems to be fading away every minute. You and I sit together, waiting. The moments between bath and breakfast, lunch and naps, cigarettes and medication, conversations and silence, dinner and sleep. The known and unknown. Remembering and forgetting. Time steals, heals and flies. 
For ahma.
