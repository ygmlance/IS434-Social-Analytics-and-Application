It all started out with the pawrents wanting to give the team a Starbucks treat during the difficult period of the circuit breaker but everyone was so generous and the amount snowballed to $2010! (Monkee & Ciccio added to the total) So theyâ€™ve decided to donate it to the team to help them out. We are truly blessed to have pawrents that cares for us like we are family. Thank you for doing this for us even though things are difficult for everyone right now. We love them all so so much! ðŸ˜˜ Thank you @chandlerpaddington @sage_the_corgi_ @bella_the_brown_maltipoo @toycavoodles_ollie_and_isla @wafflenosycorgi @prince.george.the.cocker @harvey_oodle @pepper_singaporespecial @arthur_hazelnut @rhymezwithpanda @monkee_ciccio
