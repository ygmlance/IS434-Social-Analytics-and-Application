The boys at home are super pleased with this Hakka dish. Saw few versions of how to cook this on YouTube and I decided to use thermal pot to “steam” it without the actually steaming for two hours. I realized pan frying the pork belly till a bit char helps to keep the tenderness together and gives you the melt in the mouth texture. Machiam very pro. 😂 Look what has #circuitbreakersg done to me. 👩🏻‍🍳 #客家菜 #梅菜扣肉
