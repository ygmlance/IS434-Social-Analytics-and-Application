Opened at 3pm today. A bouquet of black and red fruits, cassis, boysenberry, cigar, char, smoke and leather. Complex and surprisingly still vivid and aromatic! On the palate the wine is deep, medium to full bodied with mellow tannin and subtle long finish. I found it elegant yet still showing off and kicking so I’ve reserved one glass for tasting again tomorrow to see how it changes 🍷  Some critics said it was the best vintage of Cantemerle ever made !
