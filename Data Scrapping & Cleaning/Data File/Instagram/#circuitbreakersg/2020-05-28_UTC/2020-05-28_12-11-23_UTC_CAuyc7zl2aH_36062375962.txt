It's embarrasing but believe me if I tell you that I just tasted my first Grilled Cheese last year! Hahaha! Probably you were wondering what we normally eat for breakfast. Our neighborhood bakery is a walking distance from our house so our breads are always warm and probably the reason why we didn't think of toasting it. When I shifted to Singapore, breakfast became kaya toast, some days are noodles or puffs. 
Now we are all working from home, I'm trying to make simple and easy breakfast and grilled cheese came first to my mind. It was now considered as comfort food in our household. 
Do you have any easy breakfast ideas? Comment down below and I will try it one of these days.
