On days when I don‚Äôt want to deal with cleaning up, we play with water painting! ‚Å£
‚Å£
I‚Äôm grateful for this chalkboard blessing from @perlespective that‚Äôs allowing me to try this out. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Found this trick online: ‚Å£
1. Color the chalkboard fully first‚Å£
2. Give the little one some water and paint brushes‚Å£
3. Let the magic happen üòã. ‚Å£
‚Å£
The best thing is - when the water dries up, most of the chalk is still there so this can keep going for awhile before you have to layer on the chalk again. ‚Å£
