Rating ⭐️: 8/10

TLDR; Tastes very similar to The Alley’s Deerico Cocoa Milk, but still a fraction of its price

Yes, once again I was tempted by the free delivery advertisement but at least I wasn’t disappointed! 😂
.
This restaurant, from what I infer, does mainly Tze Char and Thai food. Not sure how they got into bubble tea, but damn their drinks are real good?!

Saw this Brown Sugar Pearl Chocolate Milk and I immediately thought of The Alley. The Alley’s was crazy addictive but also crazy expensive 😂 Was soooo surprised to know that this taste extremely similar to the Cocoa Deerico! Pearls were just the right amount of sweetness and very chewy!
.
Their food portion was also pretty huge. Had to keep some and reheat for the next meal 😂
.
Good food, good bubble tea, free islandwide delivery! I’m in love 😍
