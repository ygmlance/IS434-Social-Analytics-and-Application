Meh! First run after CB started and Zeus decided to send his thunderbolt down halfway through my run. Decided to run back to prevent myself from getting fried (see the dark blue stretch, that's when I ran the fastest). But I am still glad to be able to run 4.5km to enjoy the fresh outdoors rather than cooping at home to workout. Will definitely do it again soon (at least until Phase 2 of opening when I can hit back to the gym). #run #exercise #singapore #circuitbreakersg #sgboy #fitness
