Stay Home and Colour with Kiddo 8
✏️🖌✏️ 🖍✏️🖌
We will be welcoming June very very soon! And to "celebrate" the re-opening of schools next week, let's have one final colouring activity to mark the closure of this Circuit Breaker (keeping fingers crossed) This will be the most complicated image so far, hope you will have fun working on it!😉
Feel free to download and share with anyone. And if you would like to share your artwork with us on IG, please hashtag #stayhomeandcoloursg .
😉😁😊
