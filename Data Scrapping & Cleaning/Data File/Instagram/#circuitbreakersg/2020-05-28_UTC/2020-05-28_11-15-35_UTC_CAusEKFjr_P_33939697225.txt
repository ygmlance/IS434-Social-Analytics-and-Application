~ Cheesy Tteokbokki & Udon ~ I've been wanting to eat Tteokbokki for a week. Lol. But I'm lazy to make another dish and the Simlets prefer to eat the "same food w/o spice". Saw this awesome video from @cookingappa and I just had to try it. Spontaneously, I replaced the rice cake with udon since its not easy for a 21 mth old to chew through the rice cake. Added some corn and mushroom to theirs. And tadah, baked tteokbokki for us and baked udon for them. So mama and Simlets are happy now.
