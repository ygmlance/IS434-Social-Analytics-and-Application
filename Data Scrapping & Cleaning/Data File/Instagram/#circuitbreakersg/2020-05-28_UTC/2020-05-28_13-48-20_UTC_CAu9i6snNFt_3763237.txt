Homemade Shui Jiao with a generous amount of fillingü•ü Don‚Äôt you love it when each dumpling is thick and fat and not stingy on the filling. That‚Äôs exactly how I made mine!‚Å£
‚Å£
The recipe below has quite a lot of prawnsü¶ê, probably more than the mince meat. Feel free to reduce the amount and add more mince meat instead ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Å£
‚Å£

26 shui jiao round wrapper‚Å£
Bowl of water (for glueing the sides together)‚Å£
250g minced pork‚Å£
19 prawns, chopped into small pieces ‚Å£
5 shiitake mushrooms, cut into small pieces‚Å£
2 tbsp corn flour‚Å£
2 tbsp oyster sauce‚Å£
2 tsp sesame oil‚Å£
1 tsp salt‚Å£
1 tsp sugar‚Å£
1 tbsp olive oil ‚Å£
1 tsp ground white pepper‚Å£
‚Å£
Steps:‚Å£
1)Mix all the above ingredients together except the shui jiao wrapper‚Å£
2)Refrigerate for one hour‚Å£
3)Place 1 tbsp of filling into the centre of the shui jiao wrapper‚Å£
4)dap the TOP semi circle of the wrapper with a little water‚Å£
5)Fold the wrapper into half starting from the bottom until it touches the top until it fully seals the dumpling‚Å£
6)Use your finger and pinch the sides to create a series of folds (Swipe left to see a video on how I did it)‚Å£
