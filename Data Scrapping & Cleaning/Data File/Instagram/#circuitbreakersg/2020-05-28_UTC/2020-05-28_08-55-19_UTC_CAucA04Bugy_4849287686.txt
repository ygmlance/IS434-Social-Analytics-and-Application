Bacon-Vegetable Yakisoba with Air-fried Tori-katsu | Used pantry condiments (ketchup, worcestershire and oyster) to make the sauce; and used yellow hokkien noodles instead of yakisoba noodles (hence the uncanny resemblance to Mee Goreng hahah). A dish that's easy to whip up and modify to your liking, perfect for weekday meals!
