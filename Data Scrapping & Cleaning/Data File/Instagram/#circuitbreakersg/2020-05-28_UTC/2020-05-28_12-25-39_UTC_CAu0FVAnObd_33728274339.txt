@theneighbourhoodspideys is a community-based initiative that provides mask straps to healthcare and other essential workers. If you have a 3D printer and would like to help contribute straps, do check them out! Alternatively, if you're an essential service that requires the strap, you can ask for straps, free of charge, at their ig page @theneighbourhoodspideys
