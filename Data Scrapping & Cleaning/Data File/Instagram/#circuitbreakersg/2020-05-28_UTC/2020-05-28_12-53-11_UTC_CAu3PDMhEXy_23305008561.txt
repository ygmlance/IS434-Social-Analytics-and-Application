28 /31 - Becoming Water
Prompt: Write about a time when your bravery or curiosity was stronger than your fear.
Reaction: For my whole life of swimming, it was ingrained in me that humans definitly cant exist underwater for an extended period of time. And when i first became water whilst diving, there was a profound fear lingering at the back of my head of a watery tomb. But at the same time, with water embracing me, a whole new world was opening before my very eyes.

For #circuitbreakermay, i've decided to take on an experiment in abstract imagery using the prompts from #theisolationjournals , to inspire me from their writing. During the #ecbm (extended circuit breaker measures) that will be in place in #singapore for the month of may.
