Originated in Java, #tahutelur is such a humble food - it’s literally just tofu and egg -but one that our family really enjoys. It’s meatless, but fills us up because it is packed with protein. We shared some sticks of satay, 3 potato cutlets, and ate them with own-cooked rice and that was our #dinner from @ayampresident on Day 52 #circuitbreakersg
