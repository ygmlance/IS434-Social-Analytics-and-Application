8 weeks of farming. Finished in 1 meal. The boys looked at the rather bald patch where the leaves were and said that’s all?

It’s been a lesson for them in how our food reaches our table. It hasn’t deterred them though. One has got the idea of planting padi and keeping poultry to be self sufficient. I’m not sure where he intends to do that but it was a good conversation starter.

I’m thankful for this time where the children learn that food doesn’t just come in plastic packages from the markets or supermarkets. And we didn’t have to go on a farm visit to learn that either. (And NO ONE complained about eating veg this time.)
