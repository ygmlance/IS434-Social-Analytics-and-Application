Yesterday female Asian Koel from the cuckoo family decided to model for me. Normally she does not come out in open and hides behind leaves.  Resident of our garden and is here everyday but yesterday she decided to come in open and pose for meðŸ˜„ . Asian Koel lays her eggs in crows nest and does not do any parental job like other birds.  Crow think itâ€™s her egg until chick come out eventually raising it until it can fledge.

Koels are considered parasite because of this behavior. In a parasitic relationship, one species benefits in some way while another is harmed. The cuckoo chicks then compete for food with the host's own babies.
