Cozy Me Time | Counting down the number of days before school resumes on 2nd June ðŸ˜… Although thereâ€™s still lots concern within, it seems sending the little one back yo school is best for both the child and parents ðŸ™ŠðŸ™ˆ we are finding it so hard balancing between mom and work duties for a prolonged period of time like this... initially we thought we could do it pretty well... as we stay home for nearly 4 months now, the little one is certainly driving her parents nuts ðŸ¤ª how about you? Are you looking forward to the day the LOs returning to school or you are more worried about sending them back? .
