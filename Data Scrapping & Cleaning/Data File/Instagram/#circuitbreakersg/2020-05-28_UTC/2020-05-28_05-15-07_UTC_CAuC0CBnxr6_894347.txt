Day 52 : Throwback 2012. We actually did her Rom in 2011 and wedding banquet in 2012. The Groom was from Mauritius while the bride was a local Singapore. They were very cheerful and nice couple. Me and my husband was the Mua and Pg for their wedding and ROM. We really getting along very well. And we also bumped into each other a few times, and even in Malacca. Until now we still keep in touch with each other in FB. I feel very grateful to know them ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° #stayhomestaysafe #circuitbreakersg #fightcovid19together #bestoftheday  #sgmakeup #sgmakeupartist  #sgig #sgigbeauty #instamakeup  #love #instagood #onlinemakeupcourse #beautiful #instadaily  #like4like #thelittlebrushmakeup #jovietanmakeupartist #throwback #tbt
