My very favorite #tameepok in all of #Singapore â€” you can find stalls that sell this dish of a tagliatelle-like #noodle tossed with a spicy chilli gravy & topped with slices of fish cake, pork, minced pork, #fishballs & little cubes of crispy fried lard (for extra umami) in every hawker centre on the island but the Jalan Tua Kong #meepok stall in #SimpangBedok just knocks it out of the park. The noodles are always perfectly al dente; that gravy (fiery) is phenomenal. A perfect #breakfast. #meepoktah #latergram #jalantuakongmeepok #jalantuakonglaulimmeepok #meepok #comfortfood #teochewfood #cibocinese #chinesefood #hawkerfood #singapore #eastcoast #kamponglife #cb #circuitbreaker #noodles #sgfood #circuitbreakersg #colazione
