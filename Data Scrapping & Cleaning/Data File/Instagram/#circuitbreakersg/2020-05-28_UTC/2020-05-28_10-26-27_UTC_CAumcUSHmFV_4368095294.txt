🍝CB Day52 - Lunch Time🥣
.
Today's lunch is another classic. Fried egg noodles with its "best friend" - Green Bean Soup. .
Mum added some cubed weet potatoes to make it more interesting.
.
Mum got so used to me taking photos of all my meals... ... After I took the photo for green bean soup, I started drinking it... ... She's worried and reminded me that I didn't take any photos for the noodles...hahaha!
