Two fish were having a conversation.
"I wonder if there is life beyond the Liquid," said the first fish. "Of course there isn't" smirked the second fish, "all the creatures here are all there is, only the Liquid is capable and condusive of harboring any life."
"Surely we are not alone in the whole Liquid," said the first fish.
"Now that is a terrifying thought," said the second fish, "if there is other life what if they come to destroy our fluid? What if they come to kill us and our brothers and sisters?" "Yeah," said the first fish a little sadly, "How would we fight them we would have no way of protecting ourselves."
"We are at the mercy of Flow," said the second fish, "Flow and just keep swimming, Flow always brings us to the ocean of light." #twofish
