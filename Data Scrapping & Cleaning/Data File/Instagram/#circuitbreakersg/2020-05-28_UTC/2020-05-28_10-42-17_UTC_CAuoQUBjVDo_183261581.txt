Furry kid caught a whiff of some bakes in the kitchen and hung around 😂.... pawsister’s chocolate cookies or pawmum’s ugly looking curry puff made w prata. My first attempt using prata and left over curry chicken. I find it difficult to handle prata. Maybe ours are of poor quality... it gets very sticky once out of the freezer or am not skillful enough hence the ugly shape tho they turned up nice😜😅 #stayhomestaysafe😷🏡👣🙏🏻❤️ #stayhomefoodfest😋😋😋😋😋
