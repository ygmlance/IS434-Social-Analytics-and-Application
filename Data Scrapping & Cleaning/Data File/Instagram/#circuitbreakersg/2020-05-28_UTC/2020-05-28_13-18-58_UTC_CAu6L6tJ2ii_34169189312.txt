Trying out Quorn meat-free patties for the first time and it’s sooo good! 🌱🍔
.
Another quick and easy lunch - Grill the patties for about 8mins, stir-fry some onions and mushrooms, smash a ripe avocado (mix it up w some extra hot chilli sauce and chia seeds) and lastly, toast up some buns! Assemble them all together and lunch is served! 🙌🏻
.
First impressions - they sort of taste like Ramly burger patties 😂
