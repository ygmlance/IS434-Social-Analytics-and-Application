One (useless) milestone this CB is..‚Å£
I started buying stuff from AliExpress!‚Å£
‚Å£
Compared to qoo10 (which I usually buy from), AliExpress is much cheaper though the waiting time is crazy long.‚Å£
‚Å£
My first purchase finally arrived today after almost a month - ‚Å£
A $20 video capture card to turn my point-&-shoot RX100 camera into a webcam.‚Å£
‚Å£
Works pretty well!‚Å£
‚Å£
Always thankful for good purchases that don‚Äôt get lost in the mail. :)‚Å£
