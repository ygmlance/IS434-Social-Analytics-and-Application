My Asian adaptation of Jamie Oliverâ€™s chicken in milk. Swap out the milk for coconut milk, added Asian herbs and spices like ginger, lemongrass, garlic, turmeric, cumin, curry leaf, Thai basil for a super aromatic dish. So yummy, need to eat an extra bowl of rice. #chicken #coconutmilk #curry #homecooking #sgeats #sgfood #singaporehomecooks #stfoodtrending #burpple #8dayseat #asianfood #circuitbreakersg #stayhomesg #foodphotography #beautifulcuisines #huffposttaste #buzzfeedfood #f52grams #feedfeed #eattheworld #foodstagram #foodandwine #bonappetit #forkyeah #gloobyfood #delicious #foodgram #tastingtable #sghomecooking #thekitchn
