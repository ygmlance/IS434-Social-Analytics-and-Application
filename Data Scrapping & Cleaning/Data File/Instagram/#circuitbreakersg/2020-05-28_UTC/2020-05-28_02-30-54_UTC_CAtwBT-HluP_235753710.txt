Everyday, I’m either on my phone or using my laptop almost 70% of the time I’m awake. I know that long term exposure to blue light can cause several issues like wrinkles, sagging, skin pigmentation and even worse, skin cancer *touch wood*. So I’m v grateful that @yt.beautestore sent me a set of 𝗦𝘂𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘆𝗼 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗡𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝗞𝗶𝘁 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲.

Sukinyo’s products are made from the finest, natural ingredients and one of their main ingredients, Exiguobacterium, protects our skin from harmful blue light, resulting in anti-aging effects, improvement of skin pigmentation, etc🌿 The Good Morning skincare is also an SPF30 non-sticky lotion with moisturizing & whitening effects, while the Good Night skincare helps regenerate cells & collagen, moisturizes & repairs the skin.

@yt.beautestore also sent a box of 𝗦𝗮𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗹𝗶 𝗕𝘂𝗯𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗕𝗮𝗺𝗯𝗼𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗕𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝗸, which I adore as it helped brightened my dull skin and reduced the redness on my skin - the effects can be seen even after only 1 usage! 😍

What’s more, these masks have proven results of detoxifying & cleansing, hydrating & firming, purifying & unclogging pores, and removing blackheads & whiteheads! Wanna try them for yourself?
