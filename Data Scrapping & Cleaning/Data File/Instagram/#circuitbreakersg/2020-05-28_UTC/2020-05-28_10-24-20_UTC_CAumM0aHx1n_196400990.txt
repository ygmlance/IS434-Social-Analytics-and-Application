Dinner this evening, was a takeaway of Chicken and Mutton Satay with a couple of Ketupat, or boiled rice cakes from Zaiton Satay at Adam Road Food Centre, picked up after my afternoon walk. The satay were as tasty as always, and the satay sauce was delicious, with its old-school flavour. ðŸ˜‹  #zaitonsatay #satay #satayayam #sataykambing #ketupat #adamroadfoodcentre #sgfood #sghawkerfood #sghawkerculture #ourhawkerculture #bungkus #tapao #takeaway #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg  #halalfoodsg #sghalalfood #malayfood
