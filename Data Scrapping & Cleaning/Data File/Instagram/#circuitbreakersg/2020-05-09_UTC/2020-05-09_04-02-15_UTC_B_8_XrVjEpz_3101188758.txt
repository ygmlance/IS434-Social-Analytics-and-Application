Strange things happen during #lockdown2020... Momma decided to give me a trim.she got rid of a *lot* of body fur but it was a little uneven. Thatâ€™s okay, itâ€™s grown and itâ€˜s not as obvious ðŸ˜…. But Momma , oh Momma... look at my face! Itâ€™s soooooo uneven and over fluffed! I had a session with @amyacademy (ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ love you to bits) on March 12 and itâ€™ll be two months in a few days. What do you think I should do?
