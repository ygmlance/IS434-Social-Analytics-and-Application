UV light boxes are expensive, so I decided to build one myself.
And yes, it is at ~250nm, the right wavelength range for germicidal purposes, and yes I know that disinfecting using UV light works only via line-of-sight. And no I did not look directly at the light.
The foil on the inside is not really for reflection but more to prevent external bleeding of the UV light and also for shielding.
Still better than paying upwards of $60 for a small box to disinfect your phone and masks.
