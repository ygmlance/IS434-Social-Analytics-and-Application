Didn’t know all these cool spots until I start jogging/running around this neighborhood. I wouldn’t be able to discover more places around my neigbourhood if not because of Circuit Break lockdown during this Covid -19. Always keeping a safe distance while jogging though. #circuitbreakersg #jogging #staystrongstayhealthy
