CB Day 33 of 56. Tried a new recipe today.  First attempt in making Pumpkin Soup. It was quite easy to make. 
I don’t really eat pumpkin on its own but I do drink Pumpkin Soup. I remembered I first tried this dish many years back at a restaurant in Jurong Point when I was still in my first job at NTU.  The restaurant had ceased operations a few years later and I hardly get to drink pumpkin soup  as  I often end up choosing Clam Chowder or Mushroom Soup whenever I dined at Soup Spoon. 
One new recipe mastered so perhaps carrot 🥕 soup next? 😊 (Pumpkin soup recipe from www.recipetineats.com)
