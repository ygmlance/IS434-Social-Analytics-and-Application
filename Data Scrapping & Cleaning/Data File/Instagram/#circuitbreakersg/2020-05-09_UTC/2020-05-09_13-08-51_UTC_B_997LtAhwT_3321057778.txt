Things to do with the kids #50

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome

Perfect example of #socialdistancing seating. "Not sure what the vet gave me yesterday, but it's knocked me out." "Just as well Titus, then you won't bump into the bully who tried to #vangogh your ear." "Vanilla, he tried, and failed because I gave him one of my looks." "More like, Mum saw him off." "Vanilla, I could have eaten him." "Yes, Titus, but you'd eaten my dinner too, so you had no room." "There you go again, Vanilla, making fun of my food issues, because of this #workfromhome thing." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
