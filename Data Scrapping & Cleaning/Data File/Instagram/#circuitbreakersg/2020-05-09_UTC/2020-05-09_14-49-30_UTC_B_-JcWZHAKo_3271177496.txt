I hesitate to crown "Best Lu Mian In Town" the best lor mee (i.e. lu mian 卤面) but it comes pretty close. The traditional lor mee stalls have braised pork, fish cake and fried ngoh hiang, while more innovative stalls have chunks of fried fish instead. This one combines the best of both worlds. /

The black, starchy gravy was redolent of spices, the braised pork was tender, and the deep fried components were crunchy. The fried fish, however, had gone a little soggy, though I must point out that this dish endured a 20 minute journey home. /
