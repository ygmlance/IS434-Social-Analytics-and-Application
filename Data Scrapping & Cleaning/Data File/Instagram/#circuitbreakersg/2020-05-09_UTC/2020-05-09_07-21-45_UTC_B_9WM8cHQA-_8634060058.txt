Part 1/2 - Potted Plants

Our first Display Standü•Ç comes with a customisable base ü§ó this is our first prototype and we are still thinking of ways to improve it. Should the base be slimmer? Should it be longer in length? Should we work with a bigger piece of acrylic? So many possibilities and we are so so excited!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Do let us know in the comments what you think can be improved!

P.s we are currently securing more acrylics pieces before putting these up for sale üòò
