Made lunch for the family with 2 dishes, stir-fry beef with Yakiniku sauce and stewed cabbage. Both will go well with rice but when I saw a bundle Mee Kia🍝 in the fridge, I just couldn't resist it because I'm a sucker for noodles!😍 I also added some Mala (麻辣)🌶 sauce on the noodles to excite my palate. Spicy numbing good!🔥😋 ⁣

My family are not big fans of noodles like me, especially when eating rice with these dishes makes more sense. Anyway, they had rice, we all had what we wanted and a happy meal.☺️👍🏻👍🏻
