Happy Mother's Day to my Mighty Mummy!
First time we didn't celebrate with everyone in our family. Words can't express the gratitude we have for u. Thank you for everything you've done so far (and too much!). I owe you this üç∞ because I know raising me was never a piece of cake. Hahaha
Today gonna bring her out to buy groceries for the first time since #circuitbreakerSG. She's #stayhomeforSG for the past 30 days!
