*I finally have a wet bag for my used pads!*
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Many of you probably know me as rather easy-going when it comes to pad wash and care. I donâ€™t like putting too much effort into it. If Iâ€™m home, I soak immediately so that stains are easier to remove but if Iâ€™m out, I just find something to put used pads in.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Before my most recent trip to the US in Dec-Jan, I had thought to make a wet bag for myself as I was spending considerable number of days road tripping, often leaving after brekkie the next morning â€“ what if my washed pads donâ€™t dry overnight? ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜© That did happen a few times and that was my main concern because Iâ€™m okay with using any fabric pouch for used pads on the go (blood is viscous and not runny drippy). My own wet bag didnâ€™t happen as I was so busy in the lead up to Christmas, so I ended up repurposing an old ziplock bag.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
In the last few weeks, when I dug into my stash of solid colour fabrics for mask ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜· making, I found the waterproof fabric that I had been looking for. Yay! I was now able to make wet bags! This fabric is different from what I use in my snack baggies, which are certified food safe. The wet bag lining, while waterproof, is not certified food safe so I wouldnâ€™t officially recommend putting food ðŸ¥˜ in a wet bag.

If youâ€™re using a wet bag for used pads, simply fold up the pad and pop it in. You might not be able to neatly button it up (it depends on shape, thickness), but you can fold them and theyâ€™ll stay somewhat folded inside the bag with the drawstrings pulled. When you get home, put to soak as soon as possible; the sooner the soak, the easier it is to wash blood ðŸ©¸ out and avoid staining.

Working from home is probably going to become more prevalent moving forward so this might really be a good time to rethink single-use fem care. Once you know how your own body works, using a cloth pad when youâ€™re out wonâ€™t feel so daunting coz youâ€™ll know what to expect and have the tools for it. Will you consider a more sustainable period?
