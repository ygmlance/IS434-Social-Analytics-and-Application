Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 33:
Grilled saba fish paired with stir-fried kimchi, mushrooms and luncheon meat for lunch.

Prepared several sets of this lunch menu earlier this week so that I can easily heat it up on busy work days, like today. I must say that the stir-fried kimchi dish keeps very well and tastes great even after a few days in the fridge!
