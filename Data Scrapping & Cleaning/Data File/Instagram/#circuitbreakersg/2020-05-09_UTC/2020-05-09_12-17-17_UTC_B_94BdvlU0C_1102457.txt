#CircuitBreakerSg Day 33! Itâ€™s a no cooking day so I managed to do some household chores! #çœŸéš¾å¾— ðŸ˜…For todayâ€™s lunch we had yummy wanton mee sent over by my uncle! ðŸ˜‹ As for dinner I ordered auntâ€™s favourite chilli crabs from @banleongwahhoe! A simple Motherâ€™s Day celebration for her! Wow the chilli crab was really good! Spicy and not too sweet, just the kind of taste we love. ðŸ˜‹
