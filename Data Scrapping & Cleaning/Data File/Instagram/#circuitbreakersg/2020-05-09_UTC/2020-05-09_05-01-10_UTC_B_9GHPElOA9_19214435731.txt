My SIL ordered 店小二 @dianxiaoersg to celebrate Mother's Day! Leong mama loves their roasted duck with angelica herb and we tried the assam sliced tioman fillet for the first time too! Taste really delicious! 👍😋 Glad that we can still enjoy good food at the comfort of our home.
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL! :
