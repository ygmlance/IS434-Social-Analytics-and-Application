Day 33 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg - Had to clear the fridge of #leftovers and expiring food; For #lunch , threw in the last 1/6 of a #leftover #bittergourd , a carrot, a slice of ginger, bunch of #cherrytomatoes , #enokimushrooms , the last of the #leftover #dumplings into the last of my #homemade #vegetablestock and water; with a hint of rice wine and fish sauce plus quite a bit of sugar and some salt to balance the bitterness of the bittergourd. Probably not the tastiest of meals to some; especially if you don't like bittergourd, like I do; but glad to not waste food and this was relatively #healthyfood #stayhomewithascott #stayhomestaysafe #wastenotwantnot #homecooking
