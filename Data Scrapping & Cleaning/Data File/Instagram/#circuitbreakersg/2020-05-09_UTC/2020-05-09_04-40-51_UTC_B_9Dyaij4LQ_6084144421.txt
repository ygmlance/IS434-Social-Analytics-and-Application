Empathetic Paracetamol

I like to draw faces on my medicine, so that when I'm feeling unwell, I'll see my empathetic and supportive paracetamol friends and feel better. My friends say I'm amusing. I think I quite like myself too! #teehee #sgunited #singapore #circuitbreakersg #illustration_best #flowmagazine
