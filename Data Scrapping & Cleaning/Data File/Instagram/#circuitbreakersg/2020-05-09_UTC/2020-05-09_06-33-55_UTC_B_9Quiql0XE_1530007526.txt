🥓🍳🍄🅑︎🅐︎🅒︎🅞︎🅝︎ Ⓜ︎Ⓤ︎Ⓢ︎Ⓗ︎Ⓡ︎Ⓞ︎Ⓞ︎Ⓜ︎ 🅟︎🅛︎🅐︎🅢︎🅣︎🅔︎🅡︎ Ⓟ︎Ⓡ︎Ⓐ︎Ⓣ︎Ⓐ︎ on Day 33 CB! If you have not already discovered all the different ways you can use prata as an alternative puff pastry, now's a good time to start!😋 For this breakfast/brunch item, all I did was wait for the prata to defrost (which took like just 10 minutes), spread the bottom with a thin layer of butter, poke a few holes using a fork, rolled up the edges to make it a square, added my bacon, egg and shimeiji mushrooms🍄 in the middle and popped it in the oven for about 15 minutes at 220 degrees celsius to bake this.

When it's done, add black pepper and parsley on the top.

It's basically an alternative pizza base using frozen prata and it turned out very crispy! Other experiment ideas: cheese🧀, sausage, tomatoes and anything other veggies🥦🥕 you fancy. 😊
