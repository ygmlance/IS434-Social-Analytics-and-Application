The morning after...
So over this lockdown. Letâ€™s say I was not born to stay home ðŸ˜‚. Wake me up when we can socialize again; give never ending hugs (feeling sorry for the first person I see once this is over), dining in crowded restaurants where you are literally rubbing elbows with another, and just walking down the street leisurely...without masking it up or having to look like youâ€™re brisk walking just so you breath fresh air. Yeah wake me up when that happens. For now Iâ€™m gonna stay in my birthday suit back in bed. #nudeisthenewblack
