SMOOTH SOMATIC STAR ⠀
Here's a short fluid flow that cultivates connection with both the side body and front body through  through lateral flexion that transitions into frontal flexion. ⠀
TIPS: ⠀
1. Let your joints, especially the knees be soft and spacious.⠀
2. As you reach sideways, let the extension come from the side body all the way to the diagonal fingers ⠀
3. Let the side reach smoothly transition into a rounding, then back towards a side reach on the other side, like drawing sweeping semicircles with your body.
