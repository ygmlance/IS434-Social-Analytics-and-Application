| CB ~ Day 31 | vesak day dinner
The resident 'Zi-char' Chef strikes again!
Oh, wait. It should be past tense cos' this was dinner two nights ago. Not keeping up with my postings, my bad üòÅ
.
A first #homecooked production of Crispy Golden Pork Belly. Served with the remainder of our Japanese deli side dishes that we had in the morning for Vesak Day lunch:.
‚Ä¢ Kinpara Gobo (braised carrot and burdock root in soy sauce)
‚Ä¢ Hijiki Seaweed and Lotus Root salad, and
‚Ä¢ Takuan Daikon (white).
.
The pork entr√©e was pretty darned good for a first attempt. Very much like a Bavarian-style Roasted Pork Belly. Moist, full of flavour and crisp with a crackle and pop, served with a mustard dip and so very good with beer üçª.
.
I'd say this 'Zi-char' chef is more stealthy at cooking than anyone else. Never know what's up the sleeve, but with a lil' good surprise now and then, I think we can pretty much live with it ü§£
