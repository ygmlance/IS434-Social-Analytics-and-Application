“留在家中问声好. Big Hello from Home”: Watercolour illustration on cold-pressed paper.
📞 ☎️ 📞 
Grandpa and Grandma know that it’s very important to stay home during this Circuit Breaker. This means no family gatherings for the time being but they miss Kiddo’s cousin.
Here’s Kiddo idea number 3: Use technology to keep in touch, say hello and send big virtual hugs!
😊😉😊
How regularly do you keep in touch with your friends and family? Leave a comment below! 😉💗😊
This series is done in collaboration with @gov.sg ^*^*^*^
PS: it’s Mother’s Day this weekend, don’t forget to send a virtual hug to your mom and grandma!
