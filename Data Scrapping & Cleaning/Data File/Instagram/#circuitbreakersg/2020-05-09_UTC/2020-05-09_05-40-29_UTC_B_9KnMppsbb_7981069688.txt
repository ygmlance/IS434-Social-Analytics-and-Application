Lee Morgan - The Rumproller, 1965. For some reason I haven’t been able to find a half-decent copy of this album until the 80th series appeared. Now I have a more than decent copy. Blue Note had hoped #therumproller would see the same success as The Sidewinder. The music on this album is great. What’s not to like about #leemorgan ? The title track was written by Andrew Hill who by then was creating waves in avant-garde jazz. But it’s a blues track and a pretty good one too. The rest of the album is mainstream hardbop. I still rate this album and it should sit right next to The Sidewinder on your shelf.  #joehenderson #ronniemathews #victorsproles #billyhiggins #bluenoterecords
