How have you been managing your hair at this period of time when all hair salons are closed? 
Some people cut their own hair, when some canâ€™t even bother. I just simply tie it up and occasionally play around with home styling ðŸ¦‹

No matter how you have been dealing with the situation to maintain your sanity, it is going to pass soon! (So hang in there!) Salons are back in business the coming Tuesday and I know a lot of you are excited about it! ðŸ¤©

Wish you always perfect hair day! ðŸ¤£
