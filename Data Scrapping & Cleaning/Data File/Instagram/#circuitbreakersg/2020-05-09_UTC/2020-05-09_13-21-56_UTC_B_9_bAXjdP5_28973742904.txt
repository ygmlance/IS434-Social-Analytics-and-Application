The sweet aroma of gula melaka (palm sugar) perfumed the kitchen as I started prepping for the gula melaka chiffon cake. Since young, this is the familiar fragrance Iâ€™ve grown to love as Mum loves to use this natural sweetener in her cooking of Peranakan desserts. So at any given day, you would find supplies of gula melaka in her kitchen. And it is no surprise that it has become a staple ingredient in my kitchen too. ðŸ˜Š
