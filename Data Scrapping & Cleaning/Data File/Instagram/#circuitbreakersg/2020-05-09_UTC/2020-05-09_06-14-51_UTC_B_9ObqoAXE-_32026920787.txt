Hey yall, I'm back~~~ Are you guys still keeping up with your workout regime? Honestly, I havent.. 😅 I started off at full throttle thinking that the fuel in my tank is enough to last me through 1 month of CB but now CB got extended for another month and fuel is SERIOUSLY running out... For the past 2 weeks, I've been cooking instead of working out. I cooked boba pearls, muachee, sweet potatoes balls, mala and more tasty but not so healthy stuff to satisfy my cravings. It's fun, while it lasted...Now after packing on substantial amount of calories, I think I'm ready to get back to working out to burn damn calories off! A vicious cycle, I know but at least it gets my motivation back! So here I am, back with a new full body workout vid that will guarantee to build overall strength and burn some calories! 💪🏼
