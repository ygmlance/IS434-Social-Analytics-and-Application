BACKBEND BOOSTER⠀
In backbends, pressure is increased at the heart centre due to compression of the chest cavity, the adrenals are squeezed and the heat in the body is increased which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. This activates and energises the body and can be therapeutic for fatigue or low energy.⠀
⠀
Here's a short backbend sequence you can adapt for your home practice. 3 Backbends of your choice: ⠀
1. Supported Bridge on elbows (on toes - optional)⠀
2. Bridge ⠀
3. Wheel ⠀
4. Forearm wheel ⠀
After this you may walk the feet mat width and let the knees knock in towards each other like a tent, scooping the pelvis, letting the sacrum flatten against the mat.  You can continue with with happy baby, and/or cosmic egg moving the spine into flexion.
