Day 33 of CB - Lunch made from leftover ingredients. Made Moyashi no Namuru with some extra chilli oil as appetizer. Wonton noodles as main. Felt like a hawker with the myriad of different orders. Pictured here was a soup version (soup made with sole fish and ikan bilis) and a dried one with xo chilli sauce. Then not pictured here was a black sauce no chilli version, ketchup black sauce version, ketchup normal version, black sauce with xo chilli version ðŸ˜…#homecooked #circuitbreakersg #umamilicious
