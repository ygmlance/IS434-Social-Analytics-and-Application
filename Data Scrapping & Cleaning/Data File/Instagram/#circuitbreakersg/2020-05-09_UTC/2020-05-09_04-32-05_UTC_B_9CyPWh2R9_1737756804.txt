Circuit Breaker Reflection
.
This team. We ran ourselves to the ground right from pre-season till this very last match, the Singapore Cup Finals where we ran riot winning the match 4-1. Oh and look at the crowd!!
.
It was a mentally challenging season. The toughest. Started the season as the no. 2 goalie. Instead of sulking , I pushed hard. Really hard. Could have just gave up, go through the season, collect the bonuses and probably find another club at the end.
.
Had good circle of support within the team. You know who u are. .
Ended the season no. 2 in the League. Cup Champions and offered a 2 year deal at the age of 34. Those were my last 2 years as a professional.
.
Belief in yourself. Surround yourself with people who motivates you. Not corrupt your mind.
