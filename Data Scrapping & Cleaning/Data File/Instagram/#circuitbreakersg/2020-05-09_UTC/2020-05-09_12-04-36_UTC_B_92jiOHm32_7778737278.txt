#circuitbreakersg Day 33 - Took a break from the kitchen so we ordered dinner from @chefavenuesg 👩🏻‍🍳👨🏻‍🍳 Saw their Combo Sets and thought it was a great deal, plus no one ever said no to Japanese food!

We ordered the following for 2adults, 2 kids:
1. Combo Set C (Beef Sumiyaki, Grilled Fish Sumiyaki, Fried Gyoza & Karage)
2. Kitsune Udon
3. Kakiage 
I liked the fact that they did not use plastic boxes! We quickly poured out the miso soup into our own bowls when the food arrived. Portions were decent and tasted as what I expected. Beef was soft and tender.

To hit the free delivery amount, I jio-ed my 2 neighbours to order so 3 families benefit from this promotion! We were all happy we could enjoy dinner without having to wash up and satisfied with the food quality.
