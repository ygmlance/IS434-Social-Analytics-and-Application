My food photography skills are bad. Nonetheless, I will be posting dishes which I cooked at home during this circuit breaker period for the sake of fund raising. Pls bear with me if you are looking for my art creations during this period 🙏🏻 Above is a simple home-made curry puff using sunshine bread as the dough! Just need to fry cubed potatoes with curry powder and onion and some salt!
