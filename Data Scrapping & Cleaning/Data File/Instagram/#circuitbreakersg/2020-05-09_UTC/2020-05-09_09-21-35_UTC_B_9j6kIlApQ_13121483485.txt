Was testing my muffins recipe and hereâ€™s the product!! ðŸ˜› not too sweet and right in the middle of being dense and fluffy which is major YAY because I was aiming for that hehe. I was thinking of including this in a bake sale box once CB is over, just wondering who would be interested! If you are, please send me a DM or COMMENT BELOW letting me know if I should have a bake sale once CB is over! It would mean a lot to me ðŸ¥º. Iâ€™m thinking of including these chocolate chip muffins and different types of cookies in the mixed box bake sale! However details will be out if there are enough people interested! Hehe thankyou and stay safe my #breadmily ðŸ˜Š | #breadandbagelsco
