𝐂𝐁 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟑𝟑: 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐥é 𝐎𝐦𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞 for our #brunch just becos:⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
🥚I’ve been wanting to cook this for the longest time ⁣⁣⁣
⁣🥚 My new batch of @nuyolksg eggs just arrived the other day and I’m so eggcited to use them! ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
I added shredded mozzarella, bacon bits and chives to the light and airy soufflé omelette. Served with charred broccoli and cherry tomatoes at the side. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Not sure if it’s the use of #Nuyolk eggs or my prayers before cooking (yes I actually tried to visualise the final outcome before I start to cook. #lawofattraction LOL) that led to a successful soufflé omelette and I must say that I really love the texture of the omelette. What took me so long to attempt this? I guess cos I’m scared I will fail and waste my eggs! HAHAHA! ⁣⁣⁣IMHO, this makes an eggcellent #breakfast, so I guess imma making this again soon. ⁣⁣⁣

I know I’ve said it before and I will say it again and again... I really really love the bright orangey shade of @nuyolksg eggs! You’ve to try it for yourself to know the difference~ It took me awhile before I took the plunge and purchase from their website (nuyolk.sg/shop) and totally no regrets! Plus, now can get extra 4 eggs if you quote “𝐆𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐞” in the Add Note section. Guess who is going to quote her own name when she makes her next purchase?🤭🤫⁣⁣⁣
