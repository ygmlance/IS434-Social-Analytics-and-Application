HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY TO ALL MAMAS!! We survived keeping the kid(s) at home, entertained, healthy and still full of life despite current circumstances. This is why God made moms nurturers of her children. Your children are blessed to have you. You. Are. An. Amazing. Mom. Your hair is uncombed, eyebrows unplucked, clothes kinda sweaty, but your kids are clean, well-fed and well-read (to). Well done mamas. Here’s a good pat on ur back, hopefully you can slump in your couch with a good book/nap for 20 mins today.
Ps. Using colour palette tips from @iamgiagraham’s skillshare course. I am so bad with colours, this course was amazingly helpful!
