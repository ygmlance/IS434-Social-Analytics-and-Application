Cooked #seafoodhorfun for the first time tonight cos I rem I always dabao #horfun for supper back home for my parents and myself after work when I just started working many years ago.. Itâ€™s some kind of comfort food for us. So I decided to try cooking it after looking at @limjenjen â€˜s post the other day and saw what she had written was quite manageable to do. It was not too bad after all for a first try ( cos at least 95% were cleared off the plate ðŸ˜œ) except that Iâ€™ll need to manage the seasoning and the gravy better the next time.
