Made Gimbap "Korean sushi roll" as a mother and daughter activity for dinner tonight. We used simple ingredients like carrot, cucumber, egg roll, crabstick and avocado added with some seasoned toppings and mayo. (You can always improvised with your own favorite ingredients.) Rolling the gimbap is a tough skill thou. Luckily she has saved the day so that we can have dinner. 😂 I must said Leong mama can make really good and spongy egg roll too. 😋😊😍 (Note: Goes well with a bowl of warm miso soup.)
