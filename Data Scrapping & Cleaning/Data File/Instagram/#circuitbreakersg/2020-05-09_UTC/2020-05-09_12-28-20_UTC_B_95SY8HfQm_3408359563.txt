Day 33 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg - 9 May 2020 - #nofilter #simpledinner with #leftovers - Fried up the remaining # leftover #radishcake ('carrot cake') that I made on Day 33, this time it's 'black', with a sweet dark sauce that I just bought, with just a hint of dark soy sauce; much better than yesterday's effort and close to what you would get at a #hawkercentre ; also drank the #leftover #soup from #lunch , minus the dumplings. The soup was really #yummy after an afternoon on the lowest heat, lid on. #stayhomewithascott #stayhomestaysafe #happyweekend everyone! #homecooking
