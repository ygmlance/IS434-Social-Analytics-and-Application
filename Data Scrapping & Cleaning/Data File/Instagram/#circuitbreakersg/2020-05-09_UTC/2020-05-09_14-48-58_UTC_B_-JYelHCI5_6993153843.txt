Water Beads + Literacy | water beads as fillers today! .
For Luke, we did words ending with -ig, he identified the words and then having to dig (geddit?) Through the beads for the letters. .
For Sarah, she just has to search and identify all the alphabets. No CVC yet ðŸ¤­ .
After that, we portion out 20% of the beada for them to squash and rammed over with monster trucks. .
1 hour of free play up until lunch time!
