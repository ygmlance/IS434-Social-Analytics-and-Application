This has been one of our most major home upgrading works we’ve undertaken. Cardbox home upgrading that is 😂. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
And it’s not even finished! The list goes on.. details for doors and windows, lighting, gardening and furnishing!⁣ ⁣
⁣
I must admit though, I might be enjoying this more than the kids. 🙈 I plan my activities with them based on what I do enjoy too 😂.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣
The first home I did was couldn’t fit both of them comfortably and I started to think of ways I could upgrade it and I ended up repainting the old one entirely. ⁣⁣⁣
