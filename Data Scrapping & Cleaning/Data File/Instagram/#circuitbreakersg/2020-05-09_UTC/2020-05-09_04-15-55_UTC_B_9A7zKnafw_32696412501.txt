GoodHood.SG is a social enterprise that hopes to achieve the lofty vision of helping neighbours connect more meaningfully ✌️🏻 In late 2019, a bunch of us friends came together and shared our heart for a close-knit community amongst neighbours, to improve the health and wellbeing of our heartlands. We decided to move this idea online, to digitize and build trust among neighbours. And that is how Goodhood came about! Most of us are passionate individuals working on a part-time or volunteer basis 💓

If you’d like to join the team, feel free to contact us at 📩 contact@goodhood.sg!
