“Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us,” said Philip. Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.” | 
In this season of my life where things are changing, my desire for comfort, certainty and peace sometimes overpower the need to trust the Lord and allow His will to be done in my life. I feel Philip’s frustration and insecurity; his desire to not take any more gambles and not wanting to hide in a room anymore in fear is very real. 
Today, my heart wishes the same things - to have the knowledge and assurance of the future. But Jesus reminds me that it is in Him that all is revealed. My time of hiding in my own upper room, my time of despair and confusion. These are all opportunities and moments created for His glory to be revealed. 
I pray today for His wisdom to fill us in the areas of our hearts that continue to be shaken by fear. May the Way, the Truth and the Life be our only foundation of our lives. 💕
