If I had to do a five word review of the meal we just had from @saltedandhung, it would be 'Mm mmm mm mmm mmmm.' The beef and marrow pie was amazeballs, and along with the cauliflower (I know, I know, but this really was so good), and the heirloom tomatoes, we had the perfect meal for this weekend.

I forgot I was cooking up a beef stew for dinner tonight, and it's absolutely going to pale in comparison to this beef.
