Circuit Breaker Day 30 - Brunch ~ Low Carb Prawn & Cabbage Eggy Pancake Pocket. Ingredients: 7 large sea prawns (not farmed type), 200 g Australian cabbage, 2 large eggs (you can usex3), 1 tbs plain flour. Cabbage cut strips, beat eggs & add in flour & mix into smooth egg-flour mixture. Stir fry cabbage for 5 mins & 1/2 tsp of Himalayan salt, add in prawns to stir fry another 3-4 mins till they curled up & pour in egg-flour mixture, cover the pan & cook for 2-3 mins. Just ensure flame not too high to burn the dish. Serve with sweet barbeque sauce, sprinkle toasted sesame & scallions. SSSB; satisfying simple seafood brunch! Used to make Korean pancakes but think that too much carb is used in their recipes, wanted omelette dish but didn't wanna have too much eggs & so I added in flour at a reduced amount. Think I can be bit "fussy" at times.😁
