👇Gym Ball stretch for posture👇

There's  1️⃣ stretch that I have been advising my patients to do at home during this #circuitbreakersg

Just like the photo, you start off by sitting on the gym ball, and slowly walk the feet out until you are lying on your back with it fully supported. *Hold on to a wall if you need to balance or even better have someone beside you to hold you if u need it for balance.* Relax your hips and head on the ball and let your arms fall gently out to the sides (or on out stretch towards the side of your head) and towards the floor. Feel a deep stretch in your chest and core. Hold for 3-5 breaths.

This is great to do everyday, as it allows the spine to be in a traction position to relief the stress built up and for the overall back and front muscles to be stretched. BEST after you have been sitting for long periods of time!! #sgchiropractor #backpain
