Ending day 33 of Singapore's "circuit breaker with a dinner of oven-baked Bovmite chicken and chap chye (braised vegetables)...
The oven-baked Bovmite chicken went down well the other night, so I decided to cook it again tonight... There was no time for a 3 hour brine so I popped the chicken in brine for about 45 minutes and marinaded for 15 minutes... Turned out pretty good but obviously the longer you can brine chicken for, the more fantastic the dish turns out...
This was my first time cooking chap chye and instead of using red fermented bean curd, I decided to use my aged Taiwanese fermented bean curd which gave the chap chye a much darker colour but a lovely flavour... Pretty happy with how it turned out for a first try... üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
