When I was studying in Taiwan, I had this super delicious #kimchifriedrice at a korean restaurant (#韩聚食) behind my school (#輔仁大學). It was a staple, my friend and I would have it every single week without fail!! Ever since I came back to Singapore, I’ve been recipe testing just so I can whip up something similar. I was so excited when trying this just now because the taste is super close to what I’ve had in Taiwan. Can’t wait to perfect it!! Also, you must have fried rice with crispy #eggs and icy cold coke(zero) - always!!😋👩🏻‍🍳 #김치볶음밥 #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
