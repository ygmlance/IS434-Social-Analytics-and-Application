Yes I deserve to celebrate this Motherâ€™s Day (with my chilli crab ðŸ¦€ later!) cos I survived WFH + toddlers-preschooler + exploding tummy at home, waving the cane and screaming like a mad woman everyday, while making sure the fridge is full and everyone is fed.

Of course couldnâ€™t have done it without my right hand man (helper) who does all the physical cooking (while I mouth power only) and cleaning, and Freddie for co-disciplining/ educating the kids. Else I would have gone either gone kisiao or fall back into depression by now.

All men, please surprise your wife with something (food, bbt, gifts, flowers etc) or just take more pics of your wife managing the kids (glamourously) to help her remember this moment in time, cos itâ€™s really not easy to tackle motherhood especially in this extraordinary times.

And to all moms, a huge pat on your back plus a virtual hug - whatever we choose to do at home or however we parent our children, we will be surviving this CB and can survive any other tough situations moving forward!
