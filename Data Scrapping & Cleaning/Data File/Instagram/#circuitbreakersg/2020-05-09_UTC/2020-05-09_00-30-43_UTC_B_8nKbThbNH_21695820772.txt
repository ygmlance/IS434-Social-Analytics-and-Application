Greenwashing. We think that most Singaporeans are aware of Sustainability issues but they may not be using the right ways to demonstrate that.

The Beauty industry is one of the oldest and most traditional industries with the highest waste generated, together with Fashion. There has been a culture of consumerism wrapped around our minds and more often than not, we buy more than we need, more often than we should. 
Many Beauty Brands label themselves as eco-friendly, natural, organic - Are they truly? We've become so anti-plastic that we revered products in glass, wooden or paper packaging as contributing to Sustainability. The truth is, if we are not reducing and merely discarding these packaging after use, we are most likely contributing to the landfill. The carbon footprint of your glass and paper packaging may not necessary be less than if it were to come in a plastic container.

Information like these are not often discussed or disseminated in communities outside of Sustainability or Zero Waste enthusiasts. 
Join us as Earth Warriors at Dirty Nights x Fawn Labs, a series of 3 FREE sessions of #SustainableBeauty Talk Show. We will discuss and explore these issues relating to Clean Beauty, Sustainability and Food Waste. Find out how they are related and how to reduce toxins and food waste while we #StayHomeSG during #CircuitBreakerSG. Empower yourself to read ingredient lists on beauty products. #dirtyXFawn
