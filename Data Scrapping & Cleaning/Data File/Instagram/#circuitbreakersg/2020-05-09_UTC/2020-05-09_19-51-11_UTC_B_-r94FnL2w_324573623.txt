I am joining @yourushoursingapore Mother's Day Challenge to take this opportunities to thank my mum.

1. I seldom help my mother with chores, almost never because she could never bear us to suffer. I am glad that I got blessed to be able to atleast help her with a little cooking that helped me learn and became a good cook. I am proud to say that I didnt turn out to have became a bum.ðŸ¤­ 2. I didn't see that you aged whilst I was busy figuring out my life, I neglected you greatly. I think that people never really thought of adoptive mothers as real mothers and most people fail to realise the extra effort and the bigger heart that adoptive mothers have to have. I am grateful to have you. Grateful to have been taught well by you so that one day I can be as tough as you. You taught me unconditional love and kindness. You taught me to be brave and independent. You taught me all these despite knowing that when my wings are ready that I would fly away. You know I would bring my sorry ass home everytime Im in trouble, upset or sick. You would always readily take me back into the safety of your arms. I never truly realise how tough it must have been for you adopting and raising us until I tried it myself. Your selflessness is formidable. I could never be as brave as you. I wished that I could spend all the time in this world after this CoVid19 situation with you to make up for all the time that I have taken forgranted. You are my hero. You have always been and will always be. I love you so much more than I say. And I am eternally grateful to be your child. I love you and I wish you great health and happiness. I would work very hard so in your long life you will watch me make you proud. 
I wish you could read all of this, because it is so difficult for me to actually say it. 
I love you.
