And so it's the mother day weekend so i was looking high and low for custard apple to surprise my mom.

There was a story before it. We were in BKK for holiday (damn! I miss holdiaying badly!) and mom saw this lookalike 'custard apple'and told my brother about it. So thinking it was rare to find it, he carried all the way back to SG, without realising it was a guava. Haha! So he was really pissed when they cut opened it and it was a guava which you can find in NTUC. 
managed to get it from Ah Win's Marketplace and it was really nice, it's my 1st time eating custard apple in my life too.
