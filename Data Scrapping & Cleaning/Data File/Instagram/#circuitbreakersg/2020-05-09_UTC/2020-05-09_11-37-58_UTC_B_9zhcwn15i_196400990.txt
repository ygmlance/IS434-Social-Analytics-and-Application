Dinner this evening, was a simple affair (cooking-wise). As it was really, really hot and muggy, and i had spent the late afternoon doing prep work, i decided on something really easy. I steam re-heated 1/2 a frozen Cold Storage Black Pepper Roast Chicken, and that was accompanied with a Radish Kimchi and a Young Radish (shoots) Kimchi, both from Bibigo. To pair with dinner, the La Kiuva, Rose de Vallee, a fresh and juicy saignee rose from the Val d’Aosta region of Italy. Delicious! 😋 #blackpepperroastedchicken #roastchicken #radishkimchi #youngradishkimchi #lakiuva #lakiuvawine #rosédevallée #valdaosta #valdaostawines #italianwine #wineofitaly #saturdaydinner #eatathome #drinkathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg #thewinedistributioncompany
