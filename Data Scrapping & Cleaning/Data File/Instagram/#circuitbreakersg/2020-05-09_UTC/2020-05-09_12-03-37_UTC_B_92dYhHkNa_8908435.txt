Day 33 Circuit Breaker. Finally decided to open my Liho DIY Bubble Tea Kit today. 
And decided to use my own Oat Milk to make Oat Latte with Pearls. Oat milk is not creamy at all and what I like abt Liho's (Earle Grey) Milk Tea is the creamy texture. So end up still need to open up the pack of creamer to add texture to the drinks! Happy to make a cup of bubble tea for the ðŸ˜‡ @xinrongy since I can't bake like her ðŸ¤—
Liho D.I.Y. Bubble Tea Kit available on #Shopee
