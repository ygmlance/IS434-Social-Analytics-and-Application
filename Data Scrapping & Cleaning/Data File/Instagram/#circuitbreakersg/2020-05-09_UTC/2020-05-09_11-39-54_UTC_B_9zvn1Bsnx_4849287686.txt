who here has the patience to make crepes? tried a savory version - chicken, mushroom, and spinach cream crepe. my sister said this is a winning recipe 🙃 what to do with the extra crepes? paired them with ice cream for dessert crepes 🍦 #stayhomewithascott #covidcooking #homecooked #crepes #savorycrepes #circuitbreakersg
