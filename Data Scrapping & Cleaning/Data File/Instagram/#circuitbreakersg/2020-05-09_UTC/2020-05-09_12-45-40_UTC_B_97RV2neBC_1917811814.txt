Cooked dinner for Mum and Dad for Mother's Day. Though we can't have dinner together, we do hope they enjoy the few dishes we cooked (all were cooked by wifey @emilynyuen except the Thai stuffed wings and Thai green curry) 😛. Should be me cooking but I am just a "calefare" (extras) cook and limited skill 🤣🤣🤣
.
Thank you wifey and Happy Mother's Day ❤❤❤
