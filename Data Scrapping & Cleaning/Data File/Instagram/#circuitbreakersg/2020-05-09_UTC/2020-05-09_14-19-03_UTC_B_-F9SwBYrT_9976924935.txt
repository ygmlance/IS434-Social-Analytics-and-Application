Homemade Char Siew! Done as traditionally as possible, what with the circuit breaker restrictions. No hoisin sauce, no red food colouring, but alas, no maltose sugar either. Still, it was really juicy and flavourful, and well worth the two days needed to make it.
And the reason I'm posting this? Because of #stayhomewithascott
Awesome initiative!
