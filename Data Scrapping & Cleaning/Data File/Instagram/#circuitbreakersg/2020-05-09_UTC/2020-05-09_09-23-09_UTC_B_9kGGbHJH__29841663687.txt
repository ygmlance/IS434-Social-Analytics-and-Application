Easy Homecooked food that we grew up with -
Sweet Ginkgo Nuts, Barley and Tofu Skin Soup白果薏米腐竹糖水.

Here Snow Fungus is added and the soup is doubled-boiled with Coconut 🥥 
Instead of the usual sugar, this soup is sweetened with the natural sweetness of Coconut water which is healthier and has great cooling effects.
A refreshing and comforting dessert to beat the heat 😋😎☀️🌈 (@5tt7foodstory copyrighted 2019)
