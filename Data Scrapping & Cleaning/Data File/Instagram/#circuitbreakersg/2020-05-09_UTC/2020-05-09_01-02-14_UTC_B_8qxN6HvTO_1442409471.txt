#odetteathome again! Their whole roasted chicken wasnâ€™t on the takeaway launch menu when we first ordered, so now that it is, I just HAD to try it!! Ever since I saw it on @louise.hkg â€˜s menu, Iâ€™ve been ðŸ¤¤ over it and now that we canâ€™t travel anytime soon, this is just perfect! It tasted as good as I had imagined! Juicy, tender meat beneath crispy skin and accompanied with fluffy Niigata rice, the perfect sauce and a light spring salad. A complete meal on its own! The Normandy crab dumplings with clear broth are really good too! Thank you @odetterestaurant @chef_julien for the surprise box of caneles! #circuitbreakersg #takeoutmeals #supportsgfnb #savefnbsg @savefnbsg #supportsgrestaurants #loveyourlocalsg
