Day 33 of circuit breaker (9/5/2020).
.
What do you do with the over abundance of black glutinous rice dessert? 
Pour and freeze it into the ice cream popsicles and get "Bulut Hitam" ice cream (brings back childhood memories) 😋🤗
.
Good to know from google that Black glutinous rice is naturally coloured dark purple that is almost black. It is said that it is rich in antioxidants and higher in fiber. .
Nice and healthy! ✌👍🙌💖
