We celebrated Mother’s Day early with our second delivery order since this lockdown started. An afternoon tea set from Swee Choon Tim Sum for $50 plus an additional order of prawn wontons. Everything was still warm and fresh when delivered too. The mudder loves her dim sum/yum cha so am glad we could still have a nice spread without having to leave the house. Life during the lockdown continues almost as normal! 💪🏻 In case you’re curious, it’s officially Day 45 (!!) since I last stepped out of the home compound. It’s true I could and still can go out during this lockdown (#circuitbreakersg ) for errands/exercise but I haven’t. 😜 I guess I’m more of an introvert/bloody lazy person than I thought I was. 😂 Ok, ok, full disclosure - there’s also been a dengue outbreak in our estate these last few weeks, steadily climbing up from 2 in our lane to 9 now and a total of 58 cases in our entire estate!! I’m so staying indoors to avoid them bloodsucking mozzies. 🤣 . 
PS I’ve only gained 400g/1 lb so far ok?! Admittedly this varies week to week. Probably shouldn’t have made a tonne of lard.... or started baking so much. 😂
