Proudly introducing, Overly Cheezy Pizzeria!

Tucked away in a corner of Hougang, we rise to the occasion, just like our doughs, to get you that perfectly cheesy pizza of your dreams.

We believe in serving quality pizzas at reasonable prices, and we bring you nothing but the best in our humble kitchen. All our pizzas are handmade and fired to order in our Moretti Forni oven imported from Italy.

Swipe right to check out our storefront - our bright yellow logo and sign can't be missed from the carpark!
