Made my favourite Roast Pork Belly (Siew Yoke) and I'm so pleased with the crispy skin ðŸ˜‹ #happyme

Blanch the #pork & marinate overnight with Red Fermented Beancurd, Rose Wine, 5-spice powder, Pepper & Salt on the meat. Poke the skin with lotsa holes and brush with vinegar. Once the vinegar dries up, rub the skin with Salt. Leave it to air-dry overnight in the fridge. Brush with vinegar before roasting in Turbo Oven.

Next dish is Stuffed Tau Pok skin with fish paste and lastly a blanched green to complete the meal.

Happy dinner all ðŸ¤—
