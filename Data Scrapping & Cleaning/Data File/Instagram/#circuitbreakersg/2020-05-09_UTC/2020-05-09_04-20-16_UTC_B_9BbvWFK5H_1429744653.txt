#CircuitBreakerSG calls for dusting off my vintage tea set. This is one that my mother passed down to me from my grandparents ☕🥀
.
Of all the labels I possess, nothing is as priceless to me than my family heirlooms. There are 2 tea cups from this set of 6 that have a chip and a crack which prompted me to take a photo for keepsake in case something ever happens to them. Hope to some day fix them using the kintsugi method. I figured my mother entrusted me with her late parents/in-laws possessions because I'll find my way to restore and hold on to them for as long as I possibly can.
