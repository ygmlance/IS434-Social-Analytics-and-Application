This Covid-19 pandemic has taken away many things. Lives, jobs, freedom of movement... But it has also given me time. Time to learn, time to share, time to rest, time to reflect... I posted a cover of this song way back in December 2019. Recorded it but didn't know how to upload it properly. With time on my hands, I updated and added some strings to the arrangement, tried my hand at the mix and after some YouTube tutorials, finally here it is 😊
This season may resemble a really bleak winter but hang in there, as seasons change, spring will come next. 🙏🏻
