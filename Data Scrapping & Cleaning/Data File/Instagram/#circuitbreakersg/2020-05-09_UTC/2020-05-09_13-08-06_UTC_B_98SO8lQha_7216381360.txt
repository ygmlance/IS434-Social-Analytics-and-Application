Moonlight hor fun from KEK Seafood. Good wok hei (breath of the wok) with pieces of crispy lard generously scattered on the fried rice noodles. Not as hot as we would like but thatâ€™s understandably a trade-off for the convenience of delivery to our doorstep ðŸ¥¢

Thank you for the sumptuous surprise dinner treat, sista.
