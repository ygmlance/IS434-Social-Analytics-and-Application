Do you have $4.90 to spare?

Buy a meal for someone who needs it!! I've bought 10 meals for @secondmeal.io Project Providence, swipe to the end to see who claimed the first meal!!
.

If you can afford, just do this once. Help those people who built our nation, who are still struggling to survive during this trying period. If not, share this to let more be aware of @secondmeal.io!

They have a few initiatives on hand, check out more at:
