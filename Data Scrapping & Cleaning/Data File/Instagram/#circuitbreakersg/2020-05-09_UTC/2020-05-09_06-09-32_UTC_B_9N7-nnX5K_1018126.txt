When life gets crazy.... SWIPE LEFT

Drink #corona!

Seriously though, these two are so sweet, but some days I feel like tearing my hair and/or jumping off the nearest cliff or murdering someone. 😂

The little meimei just kept crying and couldn’t be consoled unless carried in this specific “up-on-the-shoulder” position, and out comes running #poopymachine crying but still sleepy. Managed to get him to continue his nap on the sofa space next to me whilst still carrying meimei.

Phew, crisis averted but my shoulders and neck are killing me.

I know when I can get my next alcohol fix but when can I get a massage???? 😭😭😭
