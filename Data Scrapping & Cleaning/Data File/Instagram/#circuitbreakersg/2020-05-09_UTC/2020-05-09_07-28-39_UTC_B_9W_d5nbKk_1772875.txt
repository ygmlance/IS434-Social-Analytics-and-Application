Thank you @patisserieg for the sumptuous lunch for an early Mother’s Day celebration!!! So glad to see the spread (and also received some cut up portions of it to savour too!!!) my MIL was happy to try some new items, particularly the beef Wellington! 😁🤩 #happymothersday #celebration #covideating #yummy #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott
