Teaching diversity is one of the ways I hope to help my children understand that the world is a fabric of people so different - that we think, look and behave differently, but we are all interconnected by a common need for love.
.
ðŸŒ¿This was our moment this morning, when we read about Helen Keller - my little girl could not fully understand the extent of Helenâ€™s disabilities but she knew Helen was different.
.
ðŸŒ¿At some point, sadness crept in and we had to pause to let her share about that discomfort.
.
She loved so much, the story of Helenâ€™s grit, that she made me read it thrice. And as I got our next activity ready, she kept herself occupied by trying to sketch a picture of Helen Keller.
.
We played a quick blindfold activity to help her experience what it felt to rely only on the sense of touch. I realize that this is also a fun way to refine her stereognostic sense and visual memory - definitely doing it again ðŸ˜‰.
.
I really enjoyed watching her manipulating the objects, describing the textures and guessing what they were.
.
ðŸŒ¿ Totally unplanned and wonderfully led by my child who wondered how it was like for Helen when she lost her sight.
