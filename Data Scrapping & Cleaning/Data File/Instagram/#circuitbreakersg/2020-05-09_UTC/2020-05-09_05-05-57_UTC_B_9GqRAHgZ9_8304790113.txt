[Day 24] Funtime Challenge Theme: Sweets 🍬🍬🍬
.
.
The wonderful world of sweets and candies. It comes in many colours and shapes! .
.
Little A and I had lots of sorting fun during our candy play. We made candies using our Sweet Treats plunger with 4 colours in different shades. .
.
First we sort them by colours and then we sort them by designs. Initially, she was confused with the dark and light colours. But after explaining, she managed to grasp the concept that colours comes in different shades! Pleasantly surprised that she managed to do both of the tasks in the end. Good job little one! 👏🏻
