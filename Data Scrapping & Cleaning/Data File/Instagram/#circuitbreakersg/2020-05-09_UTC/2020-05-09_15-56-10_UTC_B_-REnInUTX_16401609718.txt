🔢 NUMBERS 🔢
Recognising, counting and correlating numbers with objects from (1 to 10) in English and Arabic 💕
.

Things to prepare:
🔢Arabic numerals sand paper flash cards which were displayed randomly around the table for Hu to match with the English numeral stamps. This helps in number recognition
. 🔢 Counting and correlating numbers with objects using coins and sticks to be placed into the cut out squares on the cardboard (it’s fine even if the squares are small, because the #creativeminds of our little ones will come up with brilliant ways to engage themselves and us)
.

In this case Hu who came up with his own balancing game in between of counting for more fun. I personally enjoyed his creativity and efforts especially for numbers 7, 9 and 10 ❤️ .
Happy counting guys 💕
