Day 33 of circuit breaker, storytelling by me or Leodys? Almost every nap and bedtime, I will tell him the 3 Little Pig story. Today, he went to grab the 3 Little Pigs book and started to tell me the story. The wolf that blow (see how he used his mouth to blow), till knock knock (I told him the wolf knock knock on the pig door), and No No (the little pig say No No to the Wolf). He actually remembers what I had been telling him. I think my storytelling had drilled into him. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #storytelling #storytime #threelittlepigs #threelittlepiggies #notbythehaironmychinnychinchin #bigbadwolf  #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #sgunited #circuitbreakersg #hangonsatz
