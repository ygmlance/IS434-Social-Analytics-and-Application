Overnight Chia Seed Pudding is an easy and healthy breakfast. Just add 4 tablespoons of Chia Seed to 1 cup of liquid and let it sleep overnight in the fridge. I made mine with refreshing coconut water, you may use milk of your choice.

I like to have my Chia Seed Pudding with Greek Yogurt, fresh fruits & some homemade Granola; giving it a delicious crunch.

Chia Seeds¬†are an excellent source of Omega-3 fatty acids, rich in antioxidants, and they provide fiber, iron, and calcium. Omega-3 fatty acids help raise HDL cholesterol, the ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol that protects against heart attack and stroke.

Stay home üè° eat healthy!
