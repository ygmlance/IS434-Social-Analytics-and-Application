Bought #Frozen #colouringbook for the two kids when I saw it on #shopee #flashdeal
.
Noticed Charlene's pencil grid has improved a lot during this #circuitbreaker period. Nowadays, she can control her stroke better and colour within the lines. Such a big improvement from 1 month ago, which she was still anyhow scribbled during #colouring time. To top off, her attention spam has increased slightly too.
.
Candice sense of colour contrast is getting better. She gets the hang of different #colourshades and toning.
