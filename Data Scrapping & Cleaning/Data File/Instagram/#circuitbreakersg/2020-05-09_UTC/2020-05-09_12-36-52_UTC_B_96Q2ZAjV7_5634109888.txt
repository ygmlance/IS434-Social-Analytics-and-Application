Menu - Oxtail soup / bone broth & omelette! Stove boil the oxtail for 3.5hrs and it’s really worth it. The meat is legitly melt in the mouth kind of texture. The broth is not only rich in colour but also in taste. And after straining the remaining, I manage to reap 2 containers of bone broth.

I actually have a pressure cooker that MIL gave. It’s the on stove type (the whistling one). However, I don’t know how to use it. No rush lah, after CB, when I MIL is here, I’ll get her to teach. Btw, I went to the wet market yesterday and I am so happy with my loot! *swipe to the end to see the photo of market trolley* ❤️
