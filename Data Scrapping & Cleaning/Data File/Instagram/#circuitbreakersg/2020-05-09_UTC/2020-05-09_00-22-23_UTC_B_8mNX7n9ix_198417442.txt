💖Dim Sum for Breakfast💖 ✅Homemade white carrot cake from scratch - mum loves carrot cake so made this for her to share. 🤗 Made the steamed version on Thursday PH and stir fried it with loads of eggs, chai poi and homemade sambal chilli. 👩🏻‍🍳 ✅2 Black sesame bun
- My favourite bun before I chanced upon the other huge one I shared last sat.
- There are selling at 2 for $1 from Kopitiam. These are more of a paste texture. Filling is of the similar texture crunchy black sesame bun from as Mama Patisserie bakery but without the white sesame seeds and less sweet. 💕 ✅Teh tarik
Next local breakfast to try... My favourite yam kueh & pumpkin kueh? Ooo and ma chiang kueh but waiting for my roasted grated peanut to be delivered to my house... Heehee. 😜
