°•○●MAQLUBA●○•°
A Palestinian tradition, maqluba means “upside down” in Arabic and is a pot of stewed meat or chicken , rice and fried vegetables, cooked and flipped onto a serving dish to form an impressive tower.  the rice is richly spiced with cinnamon, allspice and more, and the chicken simmers to tenderness as it gives its flavor to the rice. 
Maqlubaa is usually eaten with just a side of yoghurt salad – yoghurt, cucumbers, tiny amount of onion/spring onion, mint, tiny amount of chilli.
