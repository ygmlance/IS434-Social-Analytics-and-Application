After a long day at work prepping for next week’s lessons and enrichment classes, I came back to this beautiful setup and him dressed in a bow tie 😍I forgot about my tiredness and the work load and just melted at the sight of this. How much of effort and thought went into this 🥰🥰 I’m so glad we found each other. You know how to put a smile on my face. You know how to go crazy with me. You just get me. I can’t wait to be married to you 😍 Happy 2 years to us, my love! Thank you Abba Father 😘😘 #mypeakyblinder #MeetTheHendersons #youiskindyouisspecialyouisimportant #tagteamforlife #mygoodplace #betterthanpresents #ifoundagoodone #daddygoddidnotforgetme #littlerestaurant #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #wemissthebeach #ourfingers
