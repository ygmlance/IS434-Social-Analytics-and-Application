👩‍🍳MUNCH AT HOME👩‍🍳
Super obsessed with all kinds of hawker noodles - BCM, wanton mee, prawn mee, lor mee - just to name a few of our favourites!!😍 Decided to create our own wanton noodles, boiling the soup, making the wantons and char siew from scratch. Making char siew from scratch is quite a fun/ tedious thing? Started off by marinating the meat the night before, then braising it in the wok and finishing it off in the oven. Our homemade char siew doesn’t look as glossy or caramelized as those from our hawker stalls but it’s still effort💯This bowl of wanton mee just reminds us of the amount of effort hawkers/ our grandparents (who used to make this for us when we were younger) put into prepping every individual component of this dish and we’ll definitely learn to appreciate them even more now!!🥰
