For #chrisellechinâ€™s CL Zoom class yesterday, she made a heart-shaped sandwich bread with Daddy for Motherâ€™s Day! Thanks to #circuitbreakersg, we got to experience heartwarming moments like this with our kids. During normal times, both the Hubz & I would always have to miss our childrenâ€™s school events due to our work. ðŸ˜ž

During this period, we got to spend time closely with our kids, and saw how theyâ€™ve developed over the days! Like in this activity, I witnessed how Chriselle was able to place the fruits on the bread nicely spaced out, and facing them down the right way! She was also meticulous and took pride in her work. 
Giving thanks for every opportunity to see the gold in our kids and the family time we get to have this special #mayholidays2020 that (I pray) would never come again. .
