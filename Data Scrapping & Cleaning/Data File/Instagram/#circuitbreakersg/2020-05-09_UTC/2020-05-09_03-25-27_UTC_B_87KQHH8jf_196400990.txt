Saturday Brunch was Bak Chor Mee Pok, or Flat Wheat Noodles with Minced Pork (and Fishballs) again! Iâ€™m using a bigger bowl this time, as the beautiful but small decorated bowls, are just too small to eat from! Tasty and satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #bakchormeepok #teochewfood #teochewcuisine #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbrunch #saturdaybrunch #stayathome #eatathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
