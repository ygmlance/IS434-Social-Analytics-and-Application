Part 2/2 - Olives

Our first Display Standü•Çwith a customisable flip sided base ü§ó this is our first prototype and we are still thinking of ways to improve it. Should the base be slimmer? Should it be longer in length? Should we work with a bigger piece of acrylic? What should we name this set? So many possibilities and we are so so excited!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Do let us know in the comments what you think can be improved!

P.s we are currently trying to secure more acrylics pieces before putting these up for sale üòò
