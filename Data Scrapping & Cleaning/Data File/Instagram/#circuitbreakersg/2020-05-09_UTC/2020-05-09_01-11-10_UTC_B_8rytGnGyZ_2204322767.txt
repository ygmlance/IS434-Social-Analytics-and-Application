Lunch from @amorestaurantsg delivered!
Everything served together makes it kind of out of shape, also we had to guess which course were the delicious bites coming from.ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
Pizza was cool - we got the Signature pumpkin pizza - I never had an idea that pizza can be related to pumpkin! And it tastes great!
