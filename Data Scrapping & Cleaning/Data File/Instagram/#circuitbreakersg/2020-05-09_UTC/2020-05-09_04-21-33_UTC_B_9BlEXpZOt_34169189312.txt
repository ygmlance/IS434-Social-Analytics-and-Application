Weekends are here!! 🥳 Anyone else love eating chapchye (vegetarian mixed veggies) as much as we do? A classic dish which is so simple yet so comforting and familiar to most Chinese Singaporeans 🙌🏻
.
All we need is some Chinese cabbage chopped coarsely, shitake mushrooms, black fungus, dongfen/vermicelli and some beancurd sheets. Start off by frying garlic before adding in the shrooms and cabbage, season with light soy sauce, sesame oil, vegetarian oyster sauce, salt, pepper and fermented bean curd and simmer for 20-30 mins till the cabbage softened. Lastly, add in dongfen and beancurd sheets, toss well just till they soak up the sauce and it’s ready to serve! 🤤

It goes extremely well with some 斋米粉(vegetarian rice vermicelli) which we takeaway from the neighbourhood hawker store and of course, some chilli padi🌶
