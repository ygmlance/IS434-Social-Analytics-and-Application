DAY 33 CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
CHICKEN SLIDERS

When your kiddo says, ma lets order in burgers today, the first thing you do is check if you have all the things needed to put a burger together, in your fridge. And when you realize you do, you tell him ... why dont I make some nice chicken sliders for you at home? Typical Indian mamma I am 😉😁
The point is ... your child must enjoy the meal. If you are confident enough to compete with KFC or McD, you make it yourself. If not, then KFC & McD Zindabaad!! 🤣

The sliders have ...
🔹️ Lettuce
🔹️ Chicken patty made with chicken mince, ginger, garlic, salt and cajun spice. 🔹️ Emmental cheese
🔹️Pan roasted tomato, potato and onion slices
🔹️ Spicy chicken karage (store bought)
🔹️Garlic cajun aioli
