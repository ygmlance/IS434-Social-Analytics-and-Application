Let it go.
.
Our kids can really surprise us.The daughter has just completed a 1.5 hour of online Zoom session teaching beginner Rubik’s Cube to 30 kids of all ages.
.
She’s passionate about the cube and had come up with her own notes and slides, while Mommy and Daddy were her assistants helping her with the setup and registrations etc.
.
We may not have gone far this #holiday season while on #circuitbreakersg but we can certainly go much farther than we thought if we stop cracking our heads over what to do with the kids and just ask them what they’d like to do and let them take over. Proud of you Dana!
