Posted @withregram • @menusandvenuessg Just had an awesome spicy dinner from @qihouseofsichuansg at Marina Bay! Drunken chicken, chilli oil wontons (红油炒手), cumin diced chicken with roasted chilli (辣子鸡?), fried pork dumplings and Qi fried rice. We ordered via @deliveroo_sg — this is the first time we have tried out this restaurant. Satisfying end to a busy work week 😋
