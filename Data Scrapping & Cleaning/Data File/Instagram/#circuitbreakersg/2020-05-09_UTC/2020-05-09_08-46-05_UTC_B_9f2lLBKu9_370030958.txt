#circuitbreakersg Day 33 Fasting Day 16:

I’m quite certain majority of you would have been on the giving or the receiving end of flowers. I often heard mixed opinions on those who throw and those who keep them flowers till they are dry especially in the fengshui perspective. .

I’m no subject matter expert but I personally find it gross and unpractical to keep dried flowers. My other half thinks otherwise. How about you guys?
