Took this game out today... Only played this once and remember hating it. ⁣
⁣
& our conclusion after playing this again is that we are not a fan of it 😶⁣
⁣
The theme and art is quite good but it’s sooooo draggy. We couldn’t even finish playing all 4 years 😑 Decided to calculate our scores after building our theme park at the end of year two ⁣
⁣
Only good thing about this game is that I got it for 9 bucks ⁣
