My lashes are almost 3 months old. It's a miracle because of @kiramesg. Everyday I comb them and say a little prayer that they hold on a little longer, just a little teeny bit longer.

My hair has changed colors like the change in seasons when there's autumn and the leaves are falling. Foresight as to how it will turn out by @tanwillie and growing out exactly as how @alphanum.eric has planned for it too. 
Counting down.
