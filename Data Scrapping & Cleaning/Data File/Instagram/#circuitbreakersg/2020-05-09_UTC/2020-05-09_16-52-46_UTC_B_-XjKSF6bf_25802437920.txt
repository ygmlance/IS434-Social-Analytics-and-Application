; {Circuit Breaker Day 33/34}

Update: Ate one slice, and it was pretty good. Not as spicy fortunately but induces warmth. Wasn’t sweet but little bits of dates provide a happy surprise. Crunchy pecan bits also helped to add a nutty flavour. And the cake was moist, pretty soft. I baked this for 33 mins.

Had to count what day it was already lol.

So not sure for whatever reason, I decided to make date, pecan* and ginger tea loaf by @olivemagazine. *I threw in chopped pecans, original recipe doesn’t have this.

Also for whatever reason, my individual mini aluminium loaf cases are missing?? Thought it will be a genius idea to use my brownie pan. Feels like a Big Brain move. (Google your memes if you don’t understand.) Anyways I just realised maybe it’ll look prettier if I iced it. I’ll think about it but I’m lazy atm.

So realisation: 1) brownie pans are not a good idea for loaf/tea cakes that rise a lot; 2) I should probably invest in an actual mini loaf pan.

I only tried scraps of this when I used my spatula to go around the edges and wow, can totally feel the gingery kick. Hahah.

Not sure if mum will like this for Mother’s Day since it is 12.52am now, if not, I’ll just go with the good old Mrs Ng SK butter cake.
