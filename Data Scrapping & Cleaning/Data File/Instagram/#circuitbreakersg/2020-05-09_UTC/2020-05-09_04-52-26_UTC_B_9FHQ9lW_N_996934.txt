#circuitbreakerday33 // The #naibai today (Day 22) with bitty #socialdistancing between plants (i.e., oh no, I planted them too close), vs Day 19, Day 12, and Day 0 (when seedlings were planted). They’re so veggie-sweet and crunchy(?!) in the morning sun that it’s hard to resist bending over and having a little nibble right there.
.
Wonder if Adam and Eve ever got round to planting this #milkcabbage or #babybokchoy, and what gardening will be like in the #newcreation. .
The current narrative is that man has exploited “nature” for his own selfish gain. This seems sadly true. But the solution isn’t to celebrate “nature” taking over earth.
.
Not a desirable outcome for mankind or the rest of creation, because that goes against how the Creator made His creation to function. • mankind, uniquely, was the pinnacle of creation, in God’s own image to rule over creation on His behalf (Gen 1:26-27); • as kings 👑 and queens of creation, higher than even the angels, mankind was meant to work the ground and subdue the earth, just as God subdued the chaos (Gen 1); • but Adam and Eve made a hash of it by disobeying God and bringing the rest of creation down with them (Gen 2);
• so man’s corruption of “nature” isn’t new - it happened at the Fall, and no #climatechangeaction or #creationcare or bamboo toothbrushes/stainless steel straws can ultimately reverse the tragic consequences of the Fall;
• yet gloriously, there is hope, not from corrupt mankind (however much a #naturelover one may claim to be), but from God;
• God sent Jesus as a man, a true human being completely obedient to God, the fulfilment of #psalm2 king 👑 and #psalm8 human - who rules the world not by having children but by dying for us (#hebrews2);
• by his death, Jesus magnificently took away the 2 things preventing us from fulfilling our true creational purpose: (1) our sin; and (2) death - the consequence of our sin (Hebrews 2:9-17)!
• however, as our failure even to control snail-snackers demonstrates, creation is still presently not subject to us;
• but Jesus as pioneer of our salvation, guarantees that we will rule 👑 with him in the new creation. And creation is super longing for this too! (Rom 8:20-21)
