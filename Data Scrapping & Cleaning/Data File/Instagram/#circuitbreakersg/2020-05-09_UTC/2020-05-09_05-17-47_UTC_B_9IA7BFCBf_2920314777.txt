Nature Mood Lifter - my Saturday morning solo walk by the river.  Spending time outdoor, exposure to sunlight, definitely boost the level of feel-good serotonin in the body.

Every walk, I try to pay attention to the moment and not lost in thought, and often have different little encounters and discoveries.  Today, I saw the monitor lizard crossing the road, few red dragonflies and lalang (cogon grass) by the water, street artï¼Œboats are so beautiful in their own way... Yes, enjoying the little joy in life and staying positive.
