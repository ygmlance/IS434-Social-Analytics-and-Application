✂️ S for STEGOSAURUS ✂️
Another dinosaur 🦕 printable which we sourced from www.eslphonicsworld.com for our activity since Hu is in a phase where he is fascinated by all things dinosaurs 🦕🦖 He coloured most of it and I showed him how the laminator works. But our main focus for this activity was to practise on his cutting ✂️ skills (he cut most of it) and it was a good attempt on his part despite the challenging task 💕 
Cutting ✂️ is another simple, easy to set up and effective activity for our little ones to work on their fine motor skills and to keep them focused. 
Ha had her #freeplay of doodling followed by cleaning 🧹 as part of her #lifeskills play which she loves doing since the bits and pieces of paper 📝 were laying around 💕
Happy cutting ✂️ and cleaning 🧹 with your little ones 💕
