SIZZLE FRY Pt. 2 - ⛩🎏🔔Tonk, tonk, tonk.... tonkatsu with Japanese chicken, potato and carrot hot curry 🍛, served with bubble milk tea mochi 🛁🥛🍹🍡, sliced purple cabbage + cooling chrysanthemum and rock sugar tea 🌼 for a balanced diet. Melted some mozzarella cheese 🧀 for my share!

Used to cook the Jap curry in a hurry during schooling days, wow, time flies!
.
Tips: To help the cutlet stay nice and flat, cut some slits on the connective tissue between the meat and fat. To avoid the breadcrumbs from coming off, cut the cutlet into one thirds between cutting in between. Did a comparison and it really works.

Swipe to see pairing of curry with our local Indian 🇸🇬🇮🇳 prata and Japanese rice getting drenched with piping hot curry sauce 😋... used S&B tasty curry sauce mix (hot) as we like it hot and Jap curry tends to be quite mild. Pan-fried the pork katsu cutlet (along with the schnitzel) before finishing off in the oven (actually ran out of oil for the first time 😅). Why make one meal at a time when you can make both? 😉
