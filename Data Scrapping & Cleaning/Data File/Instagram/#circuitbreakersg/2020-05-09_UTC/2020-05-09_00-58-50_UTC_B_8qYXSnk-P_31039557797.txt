■ Hey guys! Here's an EMOM HIIT Workout for you today!
EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) is a type of workout where you set a timer on 1 min repeats, and you perform a certain number of exercises within those 1 min intervals. 
EMOMs are useful for the following:
1) A great HIIT workout, where you switch your mind off and give everything you've got until the timer beeps (Of course there are many ways to program EMOM HIITs)
2) Learning or perfecting a skill, where you perform 1 good quality rep every start of a minute, and rest for the reminder of the minute (i.e. heavy lifts or callisthenics)
.
Check out the demo, try it and let me know how it goes! And as usual, dont forget to warm up and cool down!
