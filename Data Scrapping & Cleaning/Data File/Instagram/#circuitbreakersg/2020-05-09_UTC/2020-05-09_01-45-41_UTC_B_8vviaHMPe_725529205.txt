Dinner last night (8/5) was a combination of homecooked and outside orders. 
1.Heng Hwa Beehoon from Putien Restaurant
2.Black pepper roast chicken from Cold Storage (surprisingly good at $4.9 a bird)
3.Fried Okra (we like this dish anytime)
4.Fried hor fun ( dry version this time)
Needless to say, we all enjoyed the dinner!!ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
