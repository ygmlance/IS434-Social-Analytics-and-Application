Ordered Swatow’s Teochew braised duck 潮州卤鸭, Chicken feet鸡脚, Black bean sauce pork soft bones蒸排骨, Kong Bak Bao 扣肉包and Eight  treasure glutinous rice八宝饭. Glutinous rice was wrapped in lotus leave but I could not finish it hence I had to take out half of it as shown. I would say everything was tasty from Swatow some of the items came raw so you have to steam it before consuming. It turned out yummy however. Self prepared plain cucumber salad, blanched okra and pickled radish kimchi to balance the meal. Early celebration for Mother’s Day! 大家母亲节快乐！Sadden only by the absence of my siblings that could not come together for this meal. May all mothers be blessed with love, good health and safety this Mother’s Day❣️
