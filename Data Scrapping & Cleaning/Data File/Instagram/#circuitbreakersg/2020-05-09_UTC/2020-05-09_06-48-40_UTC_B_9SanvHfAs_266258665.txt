Goth AF ğŸŒšğŸ–¤ Imagine my delight when I discovered this cutie on @candy_floriculture! Iâ€™ve just learnt that this is a species of Capsicum Annuum Chili known as â€˜Royal Blackâ€™, and these guys are known for their little purplish-black fruits, nestled among greenish-black leaves ğŸ˜» Also I picture this being part of the Addams family plant collection for some reason ğŸ™Š
