So my $20 kettle died 2 days ago. No hot water means no morning coffee and no instant noodles... which will be TRAGIC! So, I’ve to go get a new kettle... $55! No other brands and no other shops are open. And yes, I’ve been craving for fried chicken for a few days liao... 😖😝😒🥴 #newkettle  #isolation  #非常時期  #circuitbreakersg  #nootherchoice  #sisyphus #friedchicken
