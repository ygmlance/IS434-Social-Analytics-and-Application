💖咸豆花 Salty Bean Curd💖

Didn’t know there was such a dish till @mingjiejiee mentioned to me previously. Have always liked my beancurd served with soy milk like Mr Bean style. 
This is something really different. A bowl of super smooth plain beancurd topped with a ladle of minced meat and savoury pickled vegetables. Can’t say this is for everyone, but it’s worth a try. Really impressed with the texture. Best beancurd texture I have eaten. 😍 This savoury version makes it feel like you are eating tofu really smooth silken tofu. 🤔
