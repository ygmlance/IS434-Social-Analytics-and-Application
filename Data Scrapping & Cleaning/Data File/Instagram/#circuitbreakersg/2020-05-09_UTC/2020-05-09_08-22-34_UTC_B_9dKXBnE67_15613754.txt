Basque Burnt Cheesecake craze came to me. Instead of getting delivery from the restaurants that are all selling this cake now, I decided to make it. I haven't tried the Basque and Burnt original version so couldn't tell if it met the mark but I think mine is a rather basic one for this trial. read that it should be soft and oozy in the middle. Better oven and more testing to perfect it. #circuitbreakersg Day25 #ibonappetit #mylollybellykitchen #mylollybelly #quarantineandbake #isolationcooking #lockdowncooking
