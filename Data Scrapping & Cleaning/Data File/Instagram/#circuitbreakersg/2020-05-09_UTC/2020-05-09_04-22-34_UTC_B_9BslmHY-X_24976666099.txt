The sweet sour chicken is so delicious I want a 2nd helping! I think this is now the 5th weekend of our circuit breaker? Looking forward to when we can fill our weekends with our gym classes, meeting friends for coffee and going to movies and shopping. Feels like a lifetime ago when we could do that but for now, eat first no need to think so much lah! #stayhomeforsg #circuitbreakersg #singaporefood
