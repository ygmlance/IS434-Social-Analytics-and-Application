Day 33 of SG Circuit Breaker - 9 May 2020

No, itâ€™s not about food today. ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤ª
I cannot remember when was the last time I did a craft! This is a xmas pressie and I wondered at that time when will I have the chance to do it. I did not remember it until I was searching for some stuff and chanced upon it. Thanks to #circuitbreakersg of cos, for the time to complete this. Took longer than expected, a whole afternoon (less some time for tunch break). The stitching took more than half the time. Quite fun with a sense of achievement. Thankful for the chance to do this otherwise it would have sit in the å†·å®® for a long time.. haha
