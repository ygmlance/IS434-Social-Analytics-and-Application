Kashmiri Yakhni Pulao with chicken... A dish I came across in fb first thing today and as all the ingredients was available embarked on making it. 
Everything about making something new is exciting.  The delicious aromatic Yakhni / broth and the lipsmacking  pulao ! What can I say, Saturday morning well spent
