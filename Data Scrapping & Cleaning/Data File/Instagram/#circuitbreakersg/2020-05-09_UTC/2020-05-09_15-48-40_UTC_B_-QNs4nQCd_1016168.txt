#Circuitbreakersg day 33

Rest day. No cooking, just “nua” the day away.  It’s instant noodles & leftovers. 
Some food do taste better overnight when it is allowed to steep in its gravy and infused into the meat. So yeah, it’s better today. 
Lunch today : 🔺 Fermented red glutinous rice wine chicken with jasmine brown rice. ~
