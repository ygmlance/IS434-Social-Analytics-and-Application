Day 33 of Circuit Breaker - Fishing in our WonderPond! Mama was enjoying fishing while Cadence was watching us and observing. After that, she started to catch those fishes and put inside her pail. 
Game rule: whoever catches the turtle, will lose all your fishes! If catch the stingray, will have double points! Haha 🤣
