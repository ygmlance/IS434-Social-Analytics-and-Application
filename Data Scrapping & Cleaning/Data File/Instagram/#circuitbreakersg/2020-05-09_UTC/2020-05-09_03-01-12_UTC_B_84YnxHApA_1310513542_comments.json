        "text": "likewise ^ ordered in advance at 5pm to schedule a delivery by 7pm. understand the overwhelming orders due to CB / weekend / mother's day but it got really frustrating when the order status for my order was always at \"order accepted\". it never moved on to \"preparing\" so I had zero clue if my food was being prepared at all? order status was still the same at 9pm, and my parents were starving so I had to go down to the convenience store to get them cup noodles. phone calls to the restaurant went unanswered, there was no way I could reach out for a confirmation. if delays were to be expected, please have the decency to inform your customers, so we know at least that food is still coming. my food came at 10pm in the end, after we've all had our cup noodles, and they came cold. it's mother's day tonight and I wanted to give my mom a break from cooking and surprise her with her fav Korean food, but we ended up eating cup noodles from 7-11. thank you for ruining this day for my family.",
