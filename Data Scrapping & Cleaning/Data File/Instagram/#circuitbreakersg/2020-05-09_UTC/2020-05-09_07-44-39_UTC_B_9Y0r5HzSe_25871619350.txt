Mummy @glittering_angel showed me the box of #kidsmask which she bought for me, from China. She said that when school reopens, I will need to wear mask to school everyday! I like the design and it seems very convenient as each mask is #individuallypacked .

Mummy also shared with me that these are #surgicalmasks and all China-made surgical mask will print/show #YY0469-2011 and state #医用外科口罩 on the box or packaging. CE or FDA certified does not mean they are surgical masks. .

So, everyone, please make sure you check proper and don’t get conned into buying non-surgical masks. .
