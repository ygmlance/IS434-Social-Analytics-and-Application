Cos I miss you so matcha, so I’m treating myself to some sweet treats from @hvala_sg! 💚
✨
Matcha azuki (S$7.80) - Craving for matcha but just too tired to bake myself. Saw that the matcha azuki is back for a limited time so I went to get it immediately despite knowing that the matcha intensity will not be strong enough for me, cos I always prefer cake > cream, and this is by far the only matcha cake with minimal cream and without being cloying. I think the matcha taste is even more subtle this time compared to my previous try, but it’s distinct in the matcha sauce drizzled on top which’s also my favourite element here. I like the texture of the matcha sponge and also how everything isn’t too sweet. If only the matcha intensity is more robust, it’ll be 💯! Heard that the matcha petit gateau is much more intense in matcha, but I think it’s too much cream for me! 🍵

Mont noir (S$8.80) - Wow this is amazingly good, from the firm buttery tart shell to the fragrant sesame chestnut paste, sesame feuilletine and charcoal frangipane. Everything just comes together so well, with a tinge of saltiness from the sesame feuilletine to enhance the overall taste profile. Love the robust nutty aroma without being too cloying! 🥧

They’re still open for takeaways and deliveries during this #circuitbreaker. You can also contact them to order for self collection! ✌🏻
