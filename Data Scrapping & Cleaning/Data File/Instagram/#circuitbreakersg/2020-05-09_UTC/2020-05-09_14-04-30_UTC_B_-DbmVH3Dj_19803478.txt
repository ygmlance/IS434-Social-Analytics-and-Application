Last night during cgm, we had a 10mins Motherâ€™s Day activity, we learn how to do calligraphy taught by our talented creative @ferrerochei If you want to do a hand-made card for your Mom, You can follow the cursive stroke and make sure all down stoke is thicker. ðŸ˜œ donâ€™t say I never tell you! No marker also nvm can use ink pen!  Simple and fuss free!  @wfiveonethree @chcsg #circuitbreakersg
