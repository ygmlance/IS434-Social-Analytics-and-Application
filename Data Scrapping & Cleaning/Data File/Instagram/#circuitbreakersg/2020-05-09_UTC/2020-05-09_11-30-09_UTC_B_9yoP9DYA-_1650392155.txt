Had a fairly productive day yesterday, probably because Thursday was a public holiday and I have had a break. Means that I don’t have to eat into my weekend as originally anticipated (to fulfil the surprise deadline) and can just chill instead 🎉🎊. Which is just as well, given it is our wedding anniversary today and while we can’t go out to celebrate, we are ordering in a nice dinner. Do you have any special plans this weekend, even with staying at home?
