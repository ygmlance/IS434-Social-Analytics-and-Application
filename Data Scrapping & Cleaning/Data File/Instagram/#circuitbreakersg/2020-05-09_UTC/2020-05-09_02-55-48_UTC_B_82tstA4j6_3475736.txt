Day 32 of circuit breaker, I fall asleep yesterday. So today is a #throwback for yesterday. We did exercise together. I had started to do some exercises to keep fit, tummy fat getting more and more popping out. Leodys decided to join in and lay on top of me when I am doing clutches. Haha. #leodys #1yearsoldbaby #20monthsold #exercisebuddy #exerciseathome #exercisetogether #havingfun #stayhome #stayhomesg #stayhomeforsg #circuitbreakersg #sgunited
