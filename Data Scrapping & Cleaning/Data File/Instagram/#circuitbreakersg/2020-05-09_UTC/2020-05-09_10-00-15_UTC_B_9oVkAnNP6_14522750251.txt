Got a new cycling jersey from @decathlonsg and fits a charm. Been a bit hit-and-miss with my jerseys so far so glad to have one I like the fit of.⠀
⠀
Went for a long ride this morning - was originally intending to hit the 2 hour mark again but just didn't have anything left in the legs, so called it early.⠀
⠀
Getting pretty tired of doing the same loops over and over so hoping the restrictions here are loosened soon - disappointed to see it won't be thanks to some people still flouting the rules and running in groups and more than one person from each household. Let's all do our part and get through this together!⠀
