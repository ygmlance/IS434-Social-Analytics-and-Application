Day 32. An awesome sight we enjoyed from our balcony this morning. Rushed to get groceries for Mum since she wanted to prepare soup for Dad. Missy asked for burgers. Made some pork sliders from scratch for early dinner. Followed Gordan Ramsey's recipe from youtube. Love the homemade BBQ sauce. Evening sky is calm and serene. Got a call from Dad that he has been discharged. ðŸ˜„ Doc has done CT scan and some tests, managed to detect some possible causes to his health issue. Good news for Dad. What a blessing. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #instadaily
