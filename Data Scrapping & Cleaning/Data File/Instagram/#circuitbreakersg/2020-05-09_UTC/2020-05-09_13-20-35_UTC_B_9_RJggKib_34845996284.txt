Tomato Steam Fish

Aside from traditional ways of steaming fish, using ginger, chinese parsley corriander, etc. here’s the recipe i like it very much with tomato

I make tomato paste myself: Steam tomato for 30 minutes (you can choose to boil the tomato for 10 minutes as well but i prefer to steam to keep the nutrient). There will be water coming out from the tomato but you can mix it with the cooked tomato. Add a pinch of salt, pepper and mix well. It’s good to keep in glass bottle for 2-3 days.

Ingredients: 2 Tomato, Barramundi from @9sseafood (you can use any type of fish), 4 shiitake mushroom (or dried mushroom soaked with water), grated ginger, minced garlic

1️⃣Marinate fish with salt, ginger slice and a bit of shaoxing wine for a while
2️⃣Fry minced garlic for use later
3️⃣Cut shiitake mushroom into slice
4️⃣Assemble steam plate: tomato paste, shiitake mushroom, marinated fish and grated ginger. Steam for 15 minutes
5️⃣Add fried minced garlic and ready to serve
