Day 5 Hols = Day 33 of #circuitbreakersg #ccb 
5km Run (like almost walking) 
#7dayabchallenge

Firstly, last night totally didn't sleep well, my boy was so needy, my kids spent 4 hours playing in the room in the dark. I was busy so only finished ard 12.15am. Still not sleeping. Told them I will remove the tent (we set up a tent for bed), then my boy only want to sleep on my bed. I had to quickly finish up on my prep for today's #hommeet session. 
Next, I told myself, I'll just walk, then I started to jog a little. I said as long as I jog 30min, I'm OK. Then, I told myself again, since I'm out already, just do the 5km run. And so I did. But it was a struggle with lack of sleep and running with a mask and achy joints. 
Also, into Day 6 of the #blogilates 7 DAY abs Challenge, today was bad. I'm so sweaty and wet and tired from my run but I know I need to do this. I tried my best already. Check my IG stories... Big plans for tomorrow, hope all goes well, its my hubby's birthday!
