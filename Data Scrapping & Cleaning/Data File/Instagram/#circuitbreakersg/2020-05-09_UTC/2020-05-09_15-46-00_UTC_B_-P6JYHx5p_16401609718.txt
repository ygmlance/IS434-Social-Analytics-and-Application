✍🏼 JOURNALING ✍🏼
Hello everyone 👋 
The weekends are here again! Hope all of you had a manageable week with your little ones 💕
.

HuHa doodled their thoughts 💭 before they call it a day. Hu wanted to draw the different emotions (happy 😊, sad ☹️, angry 😡 and thinking (uh-huh) 🤔) and he associated people he knew with those faces but after happy 😊 and sad ☹️ faces we drew hands🖐🏼 🤚🏼and feet 🦶🏼🦶🏼instead. Ha too doodled her thoughts 💭, hands 🖐🏼🤚🏼and feet 🦶🏼🦶🏼
I hope to instil journaling as part of their daily habits as it helps in expressing themselves. What is the one habit or habits you would love to instil in your little ones? I would love to hear from you 💕
Take care and stay safe 💕
