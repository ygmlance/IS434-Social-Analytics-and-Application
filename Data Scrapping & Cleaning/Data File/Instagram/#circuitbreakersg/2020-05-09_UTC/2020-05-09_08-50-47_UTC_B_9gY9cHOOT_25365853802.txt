Throwback to yesterday's dinner.
Again using one of my favourite kitchen appliances.... Bruno (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤ A very simple one pot meal, using cooked brown rice.... Copying "Pepper Lunch"
Add whatever meat , veggies that you like, and a little butter on top of the rice.

Cover, switch to medium low heat... Cook for about 10mins. Top a couple of slices cheese, to make it even more yummy.

Drizzle the rice with the Garlic Soy Sauce, like that Pepper Lunch provides (*˘︶˘*) Method/Ingredients for sauce:
1) In a saucepan, add water and soy sauce. Add chopped garlic. Let the garlice sits in the water mixture for 30mins.

2) Bring the mixture to boil, add sugar....and taste ! Adjust to your liking
