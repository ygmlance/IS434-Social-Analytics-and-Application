ALL THE WAY FROM AUSTRALIA , WITH LOVE 💓. Because of the pandemic , @yan.can.do.it (Caron) was not able to fly back to Singapore as flights were grounded back in Australia.

She couldn’t celebrate Mothers Day together with the family back in Singapore.

Caron discovered us on Facebook and decided to order up a feast of roasted goodies for her mum in Singapore so that they could eat together over Skype and FaceTime!

Ahhh, the power of social media these days... THANK YOU! Not forgetting #PAYNOW as well for facilitating easy transactions!

We hope this pandemic will be over soon and everyone can be together with their loved ones 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧. Here’s wishing all mothers and mothers-to-be, HAPPY MOTHERS DAY! 🤗 🤗🤗 Photo credits : @yan.can.do.it
