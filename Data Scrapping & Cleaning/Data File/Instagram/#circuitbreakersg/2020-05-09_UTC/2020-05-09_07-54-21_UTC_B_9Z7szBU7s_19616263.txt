It's finally done! Bought paint by numbers to distract me from online shopping. When it came, I regretted choosing the design because it was so complicated. Now that it's completed, I'm so happy I chose this design! Alittle different from the original (because I improvised), but I super love it! Super proud of myself ❤❤❤ #9may2020 #paintbynumbers #killtime #love #painting #cat #catlover #colourful #proud #heart #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sg #singapore
