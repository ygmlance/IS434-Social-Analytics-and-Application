Really tiring to cook 3 meals a day.. Especially breakfast and lunch, coz the gap is so close! Really salute all the people who lovingly prepare 3 #meals a day everyday for their families, not just during the CB period. 
Though the pancake breakfast didnâ€™t turn out too well, I redeemed myself with #lunch! Made a huge batch of #Wantons for lunch, and also to freeze. This is my 2nd time making these best-tasting Wantons using my Bestieâ€™s #recipe and also the #sauce for the dry noodles from Spice N Pans! 
This is truly one of the dishes Iâ€™ve made this CB that Iâ€™m very proud of, coz I actually managed to make Wanton Mee that I like, and really settled my #craving. The fambam loves it too and #slurps it all up! 
Itâ€™s a tedious and time-consuming dish to make though, with so much #chopping and #wrapping and then putting together the sauce. If I ever make this for you when you come visit me, then you must know that youâ€™re a VIP! ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª
