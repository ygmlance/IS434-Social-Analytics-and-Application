Migrant workers play a major role in building our nation. What we take for granted - our infrastructure, facilities, etc - they constructed for us with their hard work.

Now they need our help - so join me if you'd like to get a cheap, quick Tarot reading AND help contribute to Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), an organisation that cares for migrant workers in Singapore.

On Tues 12 May from 8-10 pm SG time (GMT+8), I'm offering Tarot readings on Facebook Live to raise funds for TWC2! CLICK ON LINK IN MY BIO for your tickets now!
