I enjoyed my long hike so much today!😆 We hiked through Bukit Brown 😳🤯 Feels like i’m back to my past as i grew up at the Cemetery! We went through the weirdest part of SG, deep down into the cemetery, over the tombstones, stepping/wee-ing over them 🙏🏻💀 haunted trees etc. My pawrents got so much ants on them its funny😑 I was naughty as usual so was being put on leash a few times but thats ok 🐕 🐶 My sister and i really enjoyed overselves! Fudge caught(killed) a rat 🐀! Fudge ran towards fur mom with little mice in her mouth feeling all contented. Fur mom screamed till she could literally wake the dead 💀🤭 Hehe 😉 .
