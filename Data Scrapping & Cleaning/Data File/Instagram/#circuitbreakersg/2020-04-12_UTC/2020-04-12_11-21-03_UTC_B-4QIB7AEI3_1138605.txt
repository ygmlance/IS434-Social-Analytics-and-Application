Second Salmon Rice — in a rice cooker — attempt. Too chor lor when mixing the cooked ingredients the first time, the thing disintegrated into “rice with salmon specks”. ⠀
⠀
So, I took out the cooked salmon and gave the pot a good stir, before putting it back for “rice with salmon chunks”. ⠀
⠀
Served with chye poh omelette because I needed practise. Don’t know how to flip a pan, but still wanted a round and complete piece. Succeeded! Haha.⠀
