It goes without saying how mad we are in this Lockdown. We try to upskill ourselves but sometimes we try to do something funny and exciting as well.

Over the past few weekends during Lockdown, we have done many activities, in fact necessary activities to cope with. Then we thought why not shoot ourselves and make a video.

This video is in collaboration with our dearest friend Premangshu @lovingthemblues who is a fantastic musician. We have used his original composition "Lockdown Blues" as background track in this video. 
Full video link is in the bio.
I hope you enjoy this video and if you do, then please subscribe to our channel.
