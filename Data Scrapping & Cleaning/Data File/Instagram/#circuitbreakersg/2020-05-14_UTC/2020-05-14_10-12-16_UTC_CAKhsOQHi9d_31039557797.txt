■ Hey guys! Here an Explosive EMOM for you today! 
Explosive HIIT workouts will train your muscle's power generation and explosiveness, whilst working on your cardiovascular system. 
Plyometrics/explosive workouts have also shown to yield higher caloric expenditure rates. 
Check out the demo, try it and let me know how it goes! And as usual, dont forget to warm up and cool down!
