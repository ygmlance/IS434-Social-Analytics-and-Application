Circuit Breaker / Stay Home Day 38:
Cabbage Pork Siew Mai - another take on cabbage rolls. Swipe to see how my initial plan failed!

Thought of using the takoyaki attachment on my bruno hotplate to make cabbage dumplings. BUT I overestimated the size of the cabbage dumplings I had rolled before grilling them, so it didn't cook well and looked awful after cooking. Kept these ugly dumplings in the fridge and came up with Plan B the next day.

Took inspiration from dimsum siew mai by steaming the cabbage dumplings with prawns on top. Ta-da! Cabbage Pork Siew Mai was born!

Drizzled a mix of oyster sauce, dark soya sauce, light soya sauce and sesame oil over the steamed dish for added flavour. So relieved that I managed to salvage this dish. Yay!
