Happy rainy ☔️ Thursday!

We hope everyone has been keeping safe and well at home. Have you tried out some of our #rootsandbootsonline activities? Be sure to tag us in your pics/videos to be entered into our mystery giveaway, ending May 17.

For those who haven’t signed up yet, there’s still time - just click the link in our bio @rootsandbootspteltd for free weekly resources that will hopefully inspire you and your kids.

Spend some time during this school holidays (and extended circuit breaker period) in meaningful and exploratory play at home!
