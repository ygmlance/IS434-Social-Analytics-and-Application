SELF-CARE TIPS: Make time to self-care during self-quarantine. Staying at home can have a negative effect on your physical and mental health. You’re probably at the stage where you’ve sterilized your entire house, cleaned out your cupboards and tried those face masks at the back of your cupboard. To keep you going we asked Sabrina @llunaluv how she is coping whilst being at home and this is what she shared:

Ashepa: How have you spent your time during the circuit breaker?

Sabrina: I took the opportunity to use this time for quality self-care, and bonding time with my loved ones. I’ve taken babysteps to working out atleast twice or thrice a week, cooking and baking, reading, putting in a little bit more effort in my skincare routine 😂, it truly is the little things!

Ashepa: Your skin looks gorgeous what tips can you share?

Sabrina: I use tea tree oil cleanser and rose water for toner - its pretty simple but does wonders for my skin ☺️ Ashepa: You mentioned working out, how do you keep in shape?

Sabrina: For workouts, I Zoom work-out with my girlfriends, we usually do  HIIT.

Sabrina is also wearing her favourite Ashepa Shingo cuff that is available online.
