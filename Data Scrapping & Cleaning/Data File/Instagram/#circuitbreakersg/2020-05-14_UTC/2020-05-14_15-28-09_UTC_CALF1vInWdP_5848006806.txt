Badly missing those carefree days. Today was a tough one. We had a number of activities lined up for the kiddos but somehow it didn’t feel like it was enough. I longed to bring them out for some sun and fresh air...get them to run around outdoors for a bit. But the worries got the better of me. Maybe I’ll be braver tomorrow...☀️
