Using a diffuser with essential oils to get the therapeutic effect such as reducing germs, easing stress and getting some sleep is one way which I like to freshen up my room and make the air smelling good.
Below are 5 essential oils which I have chosen based on the aroma I like and the benefits I want to create:
1/ Eucalyptus 
2/ Lavender 
3/ Bergamot 
4/ Sweet Orange 
5/ Frankincense 
And here is how I group to use the oils for diffuser :
1/ Reduce Germs with Eucalyptus and Lavender 
2/ Ease Stress with Bergamot and Sweet Orange 
3/ Get Some Sleep with Frankincense and Lavender 
So have fun with your diffuser! 👏👏👏
