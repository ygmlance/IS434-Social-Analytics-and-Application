One of the best discoveries I made during circuit breaker was to use prawn and pork rib broth to cook porridge. Add an egg, some white pepper, sesame oil and fried shallot... voila! Itâ€™s extremely delicious and need little effort.

I ordered from Blanco Court Prawn Mee. The broth came from a bundle set of two Signature Jumbo Prawn Noodle and a choice of Pork Rib Soup. ($40.60). The portions are huge. I had three meals out of this order.
