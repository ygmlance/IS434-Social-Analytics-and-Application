For every picture or video you post on Instagram of your finished dish or even of the cooking process, CHF will donate US$10 to Save The Children that will provide food for a child for over 20 days. All you have to do is make sure your IG profile is set to public and to use the #StayHomeWithAscott hashtag. #circuitbreakersg #stayhomeforsg
