13/05/20 | CB Day 37 | HBL Day 20 - Two years ago on 13/05/18, Lincoln created his very first art piece.

And so coincidentally, Linnaeus’s birthday also falls on the 13th! Thus I made 弟弟 create his own art piece on this day too. Swipe to see their masterpieces.

Of course it was a messy process. Instead of painting on the paper, Lincoln painted on 弟弟’s body. He prefers body painting 🤦‍♀️ Luckily the paint is washable from @crayola, and also our favourite SnowKids spray color from @toppingskids.
