Cod fish ◎ Air fryer version

I like cod fish with different cooking styles. I tried to fry with air fryer and it is still perfectly juicy and tender. 
❶ Just simply marinate with salt and pepper for 30 minutes
❷ Spray olive oil on to the cod fish before loading into air fryer. Alternatively, you can put butter
❸ Slice 2-3 slices of lemon and air fry together with the fish
❹ Fry one side for 15 minutes. Then turn the other side and continue to fry for 10 minutes
❺ Squeeze the air fried lemon on the cod fish and ready to serve

My quick dinner served with cod fish and Muar otak all from @9sseafood.
