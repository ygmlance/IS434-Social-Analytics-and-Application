We are already a few weeks into #CircuitBreakerSG. Some of us may be holding on better, some of us may be struggling a lot, some of us may be in between or back and forth. 
I just want to spread some words and #positiveenergy through this. Was going to say good energy... then reminded myself, nothing's good or bad. Just whether it's working for you or not. 
So here's a message: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª Hold on, pain ends. (H.O.P.E)

#HOPE Hold on, my dear friends (and this is also for myself at moments of struggles too). Be it in the moment when we don't know how to move forward, have trust that you are already moving forward with every little effort you are doing. with every mind and energy you have. 
I'm looking forward to all the real person in person meetings and catch up!!! #JIAYOU
