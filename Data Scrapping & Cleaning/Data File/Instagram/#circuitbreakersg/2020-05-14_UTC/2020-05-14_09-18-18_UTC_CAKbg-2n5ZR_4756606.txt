Day 38/56•Stayhome Snack 
I attempted Cream Cheese Raspberry Jam Danish, using puff pastry...guess what Mini K said? "Are these Ninja Stars?" 😆 
I cannot wait to share about this range of fruit jam with you! "World of Chia" has launched the 1st and only chia fruit jam in SG! Chia seeds replace the use of pectin (which is common in jams as a thickening agent), Organic agave nectar replace cane sugar. When I saw the ingredients (swipe photos), I knew this is the kind of jam I'll give Kbros! No preservatives, no additives, a good source of Omega 3 ALA, suitable for Vegans! 😍😍 .
Available at Fairprice Finest, Shopee & Qoo10. Retail @ S$9.90/jar.
