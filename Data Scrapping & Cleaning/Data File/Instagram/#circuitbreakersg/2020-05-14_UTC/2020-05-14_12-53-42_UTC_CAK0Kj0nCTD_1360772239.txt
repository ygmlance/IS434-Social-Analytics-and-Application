I’ll never let you Gyoza! - my favourite comfort food. Hadn’t been able to get it right by making the skin from scratch... even though my family have good mentors! In the meantime, the Japanese Gyoza skins from Mediya are really good! Spent the last few sessions getting the filing right! After 300ish gyozas... I think the filling is good. Now gotta roll that skin out!  #circuitbreakersg #gyoza #homecooking #delicious #sgunited #stayhome #passiton
