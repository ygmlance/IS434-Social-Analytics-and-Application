[PART 1/7: RED] Challenge: “One outfit in each colour of the rainbow?” from @kish_kebab, thank you! 💝
.
This challenge… was tough. I mean, it’s practically a whole lookbook on its own. Plus, I don’t actually have clothes in enough colours to fulfil all the colours of the rainbow, so… some of these clothes are actually a different colour IRL. 😏

I swapped this red and white checkered babydoll tunic from @thefashionpulpit! I love how the sleeves aren’t too long that they get in my way and the hem hits right below my butt. I can alter the silhouette with the drawstring too!
