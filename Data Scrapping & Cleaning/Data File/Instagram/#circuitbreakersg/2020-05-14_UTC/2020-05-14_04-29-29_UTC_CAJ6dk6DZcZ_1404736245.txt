Beads, from a broken necklace which could never get its turn at getting fixed, were finally put to some use today! Truth be told - I misplaced them longgg ago 😬, and now thanks to this lockdown, the Marie Condo in me finally woke up all guns blazing, leading to their delightful discovery ❤. But who are we to say what purpose must a humble bead serve upon coming into existence?? For it did not spark as much joy in me while I wore it, than it did today, while keeping Shivin and Ruhan busy for all of 30 minutes of this 2 month Lockdown period 😅❤. Ladies and gents, presenting - Bead painting (don't think it's a thing 😬), which injected a lot of fun and laughter into our morning routine today ❤! I secretly hoped that the beads would keep falling off the tray to keep that laugh riot going, and they somehow heard me 😁! Now off to clean the mess 😅. #painting #beadpainting #paints #artists #kidsofinstagram #lockdown #lockdown2020 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #lockdowncleaning #springcleaning #stayhome #ShivInDaHouse #Ruhanster
