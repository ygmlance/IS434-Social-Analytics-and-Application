Recovery run Thursday.
.
Repeated this route in the opposite direction today and I'm probably not gonna do it again. TOO MANY SLOPES!
.
No mask coz literally running, and the picture was taken along the corridor in my block.
.
As the days go by, it gets harder to be motivated. But all these exercising is keeping me well and sane. It reminds me that if I can continue to take the next step forward when I'm panting and going out of breath, I could persevere and push myself to do better.
