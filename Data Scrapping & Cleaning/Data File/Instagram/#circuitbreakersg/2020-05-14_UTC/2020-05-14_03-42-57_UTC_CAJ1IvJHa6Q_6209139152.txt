We miss doing the simple things,  like the table setting, plating our food, serving clients at their table,  noisy dinner parties, the sounds of joy and laughter, having our little team of seven all together again, parties, celebrations. What do you miss most? 
Stay safe. Stay sane. Stay home. We miss you.
