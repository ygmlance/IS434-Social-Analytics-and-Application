🧀The basque burnt cheesecake hype has certainly not died down yet and so has my appetite for them 😍This one’s from @lollasg - with a slightly creamy centre. Wish it was more liquidy though as It gets more set at the ends⁣
⁣
🧀It’s made from 4 different kinds of premium Spanish cheese that explains why it taste rather unique and different. @lollasg sells the whole 6” cake and is available for takeaway. Check them out for more deets!⁣
