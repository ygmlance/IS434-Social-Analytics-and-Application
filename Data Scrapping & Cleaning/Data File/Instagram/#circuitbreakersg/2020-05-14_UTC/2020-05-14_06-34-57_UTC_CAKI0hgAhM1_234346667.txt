【Recipe】One of the simpler ways of enjoying a beautiful fillet of fish. Pan seared and serve in lemon cream gravy (to mask out any fishy smell which someone in the family doesn’t like🙄). #honeybeecookssimplelunch 
I cook this periodically because I love that tangy lemon cream with fish. And it’s so easy to whip up, all you need is fresh ingredients. Sea bass, barramundi or Cod works too. 
Catch me cooking this in my IGS. And you can also find this recipe at the first post of this tag #honeybeecookslemononioncreamwithfish
