CB DAY 39 - "when will this end?" a question we stop asking ourselves because we don't want to be disappointed with the answer we don't have.

This COVID-19 situation really taught us that as long as we have each other by our sides, we are truly blessed. And there's nothing we cannot handle because we have God in our hearts. We need to remember.

Seems like we are set for 2nd June, but I'm not sure if I wanna send Jo to school immediately. I'm kinda eased into this new routine and starting to enjoy this family bonding.
