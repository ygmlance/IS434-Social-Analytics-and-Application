#circuitbreakersg Day 38 Fasting Day 21:

I know there’s tons of articles online,  sharing activities to keep your children occupied. After filtering for the #twinceywiceys age group, the indoor activities are rather boring.
Quite thankful this gal is always full of ideas.... but always skewed towards girly stuff. She’s often left disappointed cos her twin and I would blatantly ignore her and she’ll end up playing alone. LOL.

I’m sorry gurl. You’re still the best.... Love you.
