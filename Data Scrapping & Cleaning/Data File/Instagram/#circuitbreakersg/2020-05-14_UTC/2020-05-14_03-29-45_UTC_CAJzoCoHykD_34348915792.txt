F919 biofilm remover and heavy duty degreaser is an alkaline blend of surfactants plus sequestrants and detergents buffered for optimal activity. It has an emulsifying action for removing heavy soiling, protein, fats, natural oil deposits and biofilm from hard surfaces and equipment. Hard scrubbing is not required as it reacts with organic film on the surface to release it so it can be wiped away. The clean surface can then be effectively disinfected with F10SC.
