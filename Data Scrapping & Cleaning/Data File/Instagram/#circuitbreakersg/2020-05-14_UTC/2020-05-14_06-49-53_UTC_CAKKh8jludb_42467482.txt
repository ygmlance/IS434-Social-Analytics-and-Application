Throwback to Sunday, when we celebrated a most unusual #mothersday2020 in the midst of #circuitbreakersg. How does truffle mushroom soup and tenderloin steak in plastic takeaway boxes sound? And who knew cake would be so hard to find in this climate? ðŸ˜‚ And no, the Cloudy Bay was not part of the package. #throwbackthursday
