#CircuitBreakerSg Day 38! We ordered one of my auntâ€™s all time favourites @arnoldsfriedchicken for dinner! Whatâ€™s an indulgence! ðŸ˜…Only during this CB period they do delivery in my area. We ordered spring chicken and chicken pieces. We preferred the latter as it was much tastier and moist. ðŸ˜‹ Ok got to drink more water, so much fried food.
