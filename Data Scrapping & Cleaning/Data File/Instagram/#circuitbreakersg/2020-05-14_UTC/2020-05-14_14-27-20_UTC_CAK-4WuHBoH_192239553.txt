Women hold up half the sky
.
Among us are young interns, single and married young women, and mamas
.
Through this covid season, many regaled with tales of how their better halves have remarked that they are actually busy in the work day!
.
Not sure if spouses thought we were preening in office and doing nothing much before
.
Now that they realised, pls get off the couch to do your share of the housework and reining in the kids!
