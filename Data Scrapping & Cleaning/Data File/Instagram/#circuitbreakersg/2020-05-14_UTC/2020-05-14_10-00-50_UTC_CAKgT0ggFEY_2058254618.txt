Rebirth of Venus⁠
⁠
In supporting National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS), Luzerne is honoured to play a part in October 2019 Breast Cancer Awareness campaign by producing limited-edition plates and mugs bearing the artwork “Rebirth of Venus” illustrated by artist Cindy Neo.⁠
⁠
Styled as a playful reference to Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus, Rebirth of Venus is an abstract expression of how the modern woman is reborn after her cancer journey and remainds no less perfect than the goddess of love and beauty, even with her scars. The Artist uses largely pink and red hues to represent not only femininity and strength but also blood and disease, while the touch of gold and silver symbolises the triump over cancer.⁠
