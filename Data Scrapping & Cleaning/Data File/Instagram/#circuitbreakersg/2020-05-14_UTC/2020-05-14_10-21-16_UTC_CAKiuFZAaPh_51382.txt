What I look forward the most in these #stayhome days — tea time and paying homage to my favourite brands as I pack and reorganise them. 〰️ Today’s pick is @esteelauder_sg Advanced Night Repair. 🤎 It’s the first ‘proper’ serum I treated myself after I started working. I was blown by its efficacy and it has never left my skincare grail list since then.

My heart does stray BUT I always have a bottle on standby and I’ll go back to it every now and then. True love, maybe? ☺️ #circuitbreakersg #EsteelauderSG #AdvancedNightRepair #ILOVEANR #esteelauder #elcbeautyinsider #skincarejunkie #holygrailskincare
