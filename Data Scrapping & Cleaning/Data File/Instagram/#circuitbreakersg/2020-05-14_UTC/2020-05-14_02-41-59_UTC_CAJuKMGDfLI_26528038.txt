Finally made her bed and had to document. Haven’t made it again since this photo was taken. .

Let’s all remember that a photo is one moment in time. Her room is never this clean. And I am usually covered in children with sticky hands asking me questions about how gummy bears are made or how long are our intestines. I rarely have the right answers. Although I nailed it with knowing alveoli today. .
