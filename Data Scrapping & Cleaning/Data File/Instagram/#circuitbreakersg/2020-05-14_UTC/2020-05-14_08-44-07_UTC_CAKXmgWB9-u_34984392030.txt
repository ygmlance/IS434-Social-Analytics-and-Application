⏹🔼Spider’s web Shape sorting activity🔽⏺ .
.
Riding on J’s obsession with spiders🕸, I created a simple spider web with leftover raffia string. .
.
Then, I attached his favourite purple spider drawings - each with a different shape🔶🟨🔺🟢. His task was then to match the correct shape cards with the mouths of the spiders, and to name the shapes correctly thereafter. ✅
.
.
This activity was a hit! He was very engaged and learnt the shapes in no time. ⚡️ The web can be reused for other spider themed activities, so I’m leaving it there for now. .
