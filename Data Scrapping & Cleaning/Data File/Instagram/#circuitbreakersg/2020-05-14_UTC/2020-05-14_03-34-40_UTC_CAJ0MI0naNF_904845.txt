Working from home plus home-based learning can be really overwhelming and my allergies just made it worse. The continuous sneezing 🤧 that ends up with a blocked nose is always a mood dampener. That’s why I always keep a box of Clarityn tablets in my cabinet for super fast relief.

Clarityn is the no. 1 OTC brand in the world for more than 10 years. It helps to relieve allergy symptoms caused by over 200 indoor and outdoor allergens.

Clarityn tablets are mini sized, hence it’s easy to swallow. The non-drowsy, fast relief formula helps me a lot when I need to take care of my daughter 👧🏻 especially during this stay home period. Since allergies and colds share many similar symptoms I feel it’s important to be able to differentiate them too.
