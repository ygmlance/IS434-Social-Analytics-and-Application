The Brewery Hainanese Chicken Burger from Level33, with turmeric grilled chicken thigh, spring onion & ginger mayo, housemade garlic hot sauce, cucumber, coriander and lettuce, and a damn spicy chill! You have a choice of sides, and i got the sweet potato fries.
You get all the nuances of chicken rice in the form of a burger!
To order, go to the e-shop (shop-level33.company.site) or send a WhatsApp message to 8511-4613.
Thanks Level33 for lunch ðŸ¥°! Lunch with that signature view is better la, so make sure to return when life goes back to normal.
