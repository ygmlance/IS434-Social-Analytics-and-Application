Sourdough bread!! .

Officially calling this sourboi#1👶🏻.... first attempt at artisan bread but DAMN THIS TOOK REALLY LONG WTHECK 8 days to ferment the starter and a whole day for the loaf to proof overnight 🌙 in the fridge.... And yes my starters name is pungent beast...it smelt so bad for like the first 3 days then it finally smelt right and was rising and falling like it should!! Will defo be making more of this from now since pungent beast is rdy now :’)
