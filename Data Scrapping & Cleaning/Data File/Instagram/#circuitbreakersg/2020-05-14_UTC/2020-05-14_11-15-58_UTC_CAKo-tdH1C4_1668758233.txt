HERE IT IS. Completing your meal prep, you can now find 2 amazing 100% natural, low-carb, gluten-free, sugar-free desserts on the Fresher menu.

This picture was shot right after we found the perfect combination and temperature, and it was pretty much gobbled up right after. Made from scratch, we decided from the get-go that it wouldn't be dainty cupcakes, but a no-nonsense, proper, filling dessert that is absolutely satisfying.
.
So we spent more nights than we thoughtÂ we would, to churn out these tart, tasty, and amazingly moist generously sized Lemon Streusel Muffins and can we just say, it's all worth it. And when you've been working out your hardest ever, it's a pretty darn good feeling to get to enjoy these treats.
.
These delicate muffins are sweetened with All-Natural Erythritol and bake with New Zealand #Tatua Sour Cream for a #lowcarb, #keto friendly nutrition.
