My loot from last Friday's @misstamchiak Facebook Live just arrived yesterday evening and that settled today's easy lunch. I savoured them simply with Bee Tai Bak mixed with Ginger Scallion Oil, soy sauce, fish sauce and some Taiwanese spicy chili sauce. Yum yum! 😋⁣⁣

These Fish Dumplings, Fish Rolls and FIshballs from Lixin were pretty amazing. The texture of the Fish Dumplings and Fish Rolls are slippery smooth and this is how good ones should be. Oh, and the Fish Dumplings are huge!! 👍🏻👍🏻🤩⁣

Catch @misstamchiak in FB for good yummy deals every Friday! 🎉
