So... After yesterday's post, alot of people ask me this very scary question.. "Sam, can you still fit into your kebaya?!" I was damn stressed. Cos the kebaya is made with unstretchable material.. It will really split at the seams one.

After pigging out (yes you can see my face is pimply due to all the carbs I'm eating..) I actually pulled my kabaya out and tried it on.

Yes I do have a set that is brand new, that they have made it tighter for my wedding cos I requested them to. So here you go

Yes I can still fit.. And it is a little loose

So how is your CB treating you? And we are about  3 weeks away from the easing of WFH.. Can you still fit in most of your work clothes?

If not, there are 3 choice

1, buy more clothes now so they come in time, and possibly feel happy cos shopping or crappy cos upsize.. 2, get off your ass and exercise and stop eating rubbish.. 3, ask me how ketones can help and WORK WITH ME the next few weeks.. Will probably cost less then the clothes you need to buy.. ðŸ˜‰

But your choice.. Its either you take control back or just blame it on circumstances.. We are all stuck in this CB together so time to make the best out of what this slight pause in life!! #ketonessingapore #keto #singapore #singaporegirl #kebaya #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #stayhomebeforeandafter #ketones
