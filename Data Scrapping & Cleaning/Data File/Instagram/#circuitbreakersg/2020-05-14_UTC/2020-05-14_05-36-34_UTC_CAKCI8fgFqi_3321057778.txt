Things to do with the kids #55

Teaching the #cats the art of #socialdistancing and how to #stayathome "Vanilla, what are you doing?" "Titus, I've been working out in the gym downstairs. Something you should have a go at." "I didn't ask what you've been doing, I asked what you ARE doing?" "I'm taking a breather on this rather splendid #doobbeanbag. Don't you think it complements my complexion?" "Vanilla, you're a cat." "Well done, Titus, you've been listening." #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
