Back in the kitchen again, after a birthday break (the man forbade me from cooking😋). First thing in the morning, whipped up pork porridge, something he's been craving for recently. 
Proud to say it tasted as good as those bought ones.☺️ Added meatballs alongside minced meat for a contrasting texture.🐷
