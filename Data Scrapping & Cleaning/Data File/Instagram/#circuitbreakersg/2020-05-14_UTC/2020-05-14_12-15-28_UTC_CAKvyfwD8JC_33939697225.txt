~ Scrambled Egg Tomato Flat Noodle ~ We had Phad Thai for dinner but I find it having too much seasonings for the Simlets. So I made them stir fried flat noodle with scrambled egg and tomato. I added diced chicken cubes for protein. The daddy exclaimed before he could finish feeding the younger Simlet the older one has finished one serving! So I conclude this should be part of our regular menu.
