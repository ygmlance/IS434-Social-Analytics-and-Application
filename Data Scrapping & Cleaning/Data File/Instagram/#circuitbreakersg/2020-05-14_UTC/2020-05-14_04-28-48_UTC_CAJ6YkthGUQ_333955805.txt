You know, Today I'm Cleaning Up {Eid Cleaning} in my Home and I found my 1 of my Judge-Badge from when I was Invited to Judge in Novosibirsk, Russia ❤😍🤩 Oh Wow! Brings So Much Memory! 
I am thankful to have travelled to so Many Different Countries thruout my Career, Experienced Vast cultures & Meet Abundance people of many Nationalities, Backgrounds, Race, Religions. Most Importantly, I'm so Well Exposed to Other's Perspectives in Life. I like to Listen to them & Absorb all these Knowledge. If you Listen Well, There's so many to Be Learnt. It makes you much Wiser, more Understanding & Uniquely Mindful.

After 10 years... Masha'Allah This is Why I am ME 🌺 You cannot weigh how much this Mind & Eyes have seen/learn. Yes, that's too little still but I'm so Thankful. This is why my Perspectives in Life is extremely different from others who do not experience the same things I have.

My Siberia & Kazakhstan Friends, Yes I miss you all 🥰 I still Keep the Badge! 😃 Till We Meet again! Xoxo #3Kisses Always -Instructor Katz @instructor.katz
