Day 38 of #circuitbreaker: Learning Maths is SO fun with @koobits! I don’t have to nag at my kids to do their online work 👍They will auto login coz they love it & request to do more! Complete the challenge each day & earn Koko credits! Use credits to redeem game play. Just 30mins a day :) Their fave subject is Maths 💓⁣

This site is really easy to navigate + I’ve been able to keep track of their progress in the ‘KooBits’ Parent app ✌🏻⁣
