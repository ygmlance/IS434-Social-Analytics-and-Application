Been taking away food from Miska lately, because their menu is big, and we were in the region. I noticed that they have been opening later and later in the day, so I guess we also wanted to support them. #supportsmall instead of the crowded competitor next door which is a large chain business. I really loved how many of their brunch dishes came with pita bread! I toast them again in the oven and they crisp up nicely. This Halloumi and Eggs dish also has spinach and mushrooms. This makes for such a nice filling brunch.ðŸ˜‹
