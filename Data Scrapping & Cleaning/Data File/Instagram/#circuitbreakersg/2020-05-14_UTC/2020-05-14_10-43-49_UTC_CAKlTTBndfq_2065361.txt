I woke up to this on Mother’s Day. 
My super excited boy jumped outta bed and made me breakfast with all HIS fave food. 
我的小展睿，谢谢你的爱❤️ And yea , This is not his typical breakfast but probably his ideal one. 
He had been eyeing those jellies in my fridge for a while but was constantly rejected (by me). So he took this chance to say:
“Mummy, 你吃这个lychee 的。我吃这个grape的 jelly ok. 我们一起吃。” *bambi eyes* 
儿子,你赢了lor. 
He won my heart and a grape jelly that day. 
Thank you God for gifting such a sweet & cheeky boy to our family and making me Sean’s mummy.
