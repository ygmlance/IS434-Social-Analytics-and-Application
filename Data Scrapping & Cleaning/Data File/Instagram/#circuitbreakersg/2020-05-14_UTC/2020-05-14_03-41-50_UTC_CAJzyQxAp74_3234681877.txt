With this circuit breaker, I have less time for art and hence turn to cooking as my creative outlet. After all, I need to feed the kiddo who gets hungry often! .

The past week, I challenged myself by making Yogurt flatbread (like prata), Scallions pancakes and Mee hoon kueh noodles from scratch. Given that this is my first time making them, (note I’m not after perfection but creation), I’m really happy with the results and I just want to show that given some planning and time, we can make these traditional food ourselves! Here’s a video of #Meehoonkueh and the recipe is based on the food websites and videos (just Google it). I’ll post the recipe on my website soon so you can try it! .
