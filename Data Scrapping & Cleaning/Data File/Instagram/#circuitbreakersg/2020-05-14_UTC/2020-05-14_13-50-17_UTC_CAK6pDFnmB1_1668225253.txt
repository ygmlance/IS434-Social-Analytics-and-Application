Into the 6th week of the circuit breaker, here is another Car Care Tip for you especially for those who have not been driving your vehicle over this period.

#4 Disengage your Vehicle’s Parking Brake

Engaging the handbrake over an extended period may cause the brakes mechanism to get stuck. Release your vehicle’s parking brake and use wheel chocks or bricks to keep the car in place.

Take Care and Stay Safe!
