PALAK BROCOLLI PANEER (Spinach with brocolli and cottage cheese)
Simple vegetarian meal today. Masoor daal, Dahi, Achaar, Palak paneer, Roti.
Now the palak paneer here has a twist to it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Its half palak (Spinach) and half broccoli. The idea is not mine, it comes from @food2goodbypriti
Saw you post Priti, and jumped with joy. I had a cup of boiled brocolli in the fridge, leftover from what I had boiled for soup a day ago. I was wondering how to use it. This was the perfect idea!
My son loved it, though he could not make out what it was. He just said the palak paneer tastes a little different, but its yumm. Made it the regular way I make palak paneer. No other change in the recipe and it worked. 
Why dont you all try it too. Use your recipe, or you could use Priti's recipe. Its a great way to get your little ones to eat brocolli üòâ
