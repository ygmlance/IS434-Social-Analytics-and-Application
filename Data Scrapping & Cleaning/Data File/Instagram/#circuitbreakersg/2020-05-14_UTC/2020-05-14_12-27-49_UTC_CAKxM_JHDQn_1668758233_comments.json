I feel things were taken out of context by their cheese cake supplier and I never thought that they were cheating me in anyway, in fact I do own a business involving F&B so I do not feel like they did anything malicious or unethical like how people are claiming them to be. To people who are thinking of working with others, put some thought into knowing who you are working with so that you don\u2019t end up in this situation, after giving your best in the business. The feeling must suck to be involved in this unnecessary drama and to be blamed for something you didn\u2019t do wrong but I will continue to support Fresher all the way, even more after this \u2764\ufe0f",

Since the beginning when Fresher introduce the cheesecake as dessert, I was informed by Claire that this cheesecake was a product of their partner, the cheesecake was supplied by their partner and was not made by Fresher. She further confirms verbally with me during our chanced meetup at a gym when she was venturing into providing healthy meals to gym goers. In no way did she steal all the credits from the supplier or mislead me into thinking that the cheesecake is a product of Fresher. I believed she have been outright truthful in how the cheesecake came about as part of their effort to provide healthy meals. I had liked the part when they decided venturing into producing their own version of cheesecake, and I have faith & belief that Fresher and Claire is not morally unethical into stealing their supplier's product. Rather, I believe its their own focus to trial n error venture approach into new business model. This is the Fresher and Claire I know since the start from 5-6 years ago. They are continuously experimenting and adventurous in the development of new receipes. To those who decides not to order from Fresher, I thank you cuz it means I will  face lesser competition with my orders (imagine my exasperation when food is out of stock!). To Fresher, you will have my continued support. Going the thorny path of success isn't easy, but keep in faith and be  morally ethical as you always have been. Cheers. You won't lost a customer in me just cause of this saga.",

There is also no point arguing about how different the recipes are, whether it's collab or partners. If Fresher claims that they are not collab or partners or related in anyway, then what's the point of drawing reference to SMK in the post. To show how \"inspired\" they are? OR an intent to somehow \"relate\" or \"imply\" that their product is same as SMK? (eg. If I said, I made a drink hugely inspired by Coca Cola, whats the first thing that cross your mind? Definitely not a fruit juice) And it's this reference to SMK and their refusal to address it that is causing all this issue. Going into other details are just trying to divert us from the main point. Which is \"what's the point of drawing reference to SMK?\" you want to promote business to SMK cakes because you are making your own now? I'm sure as savvy business owners who knows how to trim and cut cost (hopefully not at the expense of cutting quality) to make profit, you can't be making a product while promoting your competitors one right?",

The reason why we used these examples is simply because the relationship was indeed a merchant and a supplier relationship. Things were offered on credit terms and smk was asked for a commercial rate, which she responded to. Do you think a collaboration would encompass all of these? Y\u2019all have to understand that there proper business terms to everything, not just loosely hang the word \u201ccollaboration\u201d around your mouth because she felt like Fresher was collaborating with her. Well that kinda just shows how nice the people at fresher are then, they treat their supplier so nice to the point their supplier thinks it\u2019s a collaboration. Stop using words like they were",

It wasn\u2019t an outright ripoff, they had customers to serve that they couldn\u2019t due to the lack of supply because of the covid 19 situation. They had to think of a plan B. They had orders for a cheese cake and if they do NOT make a cheese cake that LOOKS like a cheese cake then is it even a cheese cake? And is it compulsory for Fresher to update their supplier on what they are coming up for their house brand, what\u2019s their contingency plan on a daily basis? If your answer is NO, then why are you making noise? If your answer is yes, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re a demanding supplier who needs to know what the merchant is doing? Does Neo Garden ask their supplier what they are feeding their chicken every day? And if y\u2019all want to say Fresher is some big boy out in the market that is so untrue, not like Smk never seen them before? They are a small team of people who are working even until 5-6am, and the F&B world IS LIKE THAT. So quit whining about",

I really try to be v patient but u all keep using unfair conjectures. I'm not angry at fresher for selling cheesecake or the lemonturdmuffin thing. Its about the way its done, how hard is it to understand that? At the start they nv tell ppl. Now edit already, send army of trolls to ppl who spark the edit. And... It's not even obvious that the pic they post on their website is a pic of a cake THEY baked leh. Cuz if it's not, then potentially misselling cuz that cake sho pretty. But im sure fresher can bake a prettier one since all the recipes on the internet seem to show pretty cakes only. But ultimately. Case closed.  I wont buy from fresher, u probably wont buy from the baker, we all made our cases, conclusion is we have different morale standards, we draw different lines, and hats off to Claire for keeping this thread open bu5 shame on youfor not just apologising (which frankly, resolves everything)",

If you\u2019re saying that the Japanese keto cake baker gave fresher everything and not get anything in return then ya it\u2019s unethical. But don\u2019t tell me she didn\u2019t benefit from fresher\u2019s customers too? Only she introduced clients to them? A collaboration is a two way thing. And during the times when home baking services were not available, they made the cakes themselves from Google and realised that they can do it then why not? How to steal a recipe when no recipe was given? I don\u2019t understand is there something i\u2019m missing? I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re trying to understand the situation. If today I am taking supplies from ABC store, but DEF charge me cheaper for the same thing, why won\u2019t I change supplier? Regardless we can still all support each other in this local business scene, why have to make a huge hoohah and attack each other? It\u2019s just one less collaboration, and there are so many people who can collaborate with Japanese keto cake? I\u2019m sure many people want to try. But now, I would be scared to collaborate because if I ever chose to end the collaboration I would probably be called out as a bully with no substantial evidence but just what you feel. I apologise to you for being rude but I\u2019m just like what are you guys thinking man? Lol.",

Fresher is of course allowed to source for cheaper options, drop soulmyeketo, do whatever they want. What is NOT acceptable is... Experimenting with the recipe (or so they say) without telling the original baker, make plans to launch it behind her back, inform her they are dropping her ONE DAY before the launch, advertising their new  in house bake as if it were the one customers have been ordering all this while. Please get the facts right. Fresher is free to make their own. Kudos to them if they say they have mastered the recipe on their own. But what is NOT COOL is being UNETHICAL in the manner by which they want to end the collab. Give credit where credit is due. The cakes were from soulmyeketo. End of story. NOT fresher.",

I for one would never have ordered frozen meals until the original baker shared yr site. 2.  U didn't disclose upfront the cake was not by her. I would have been conned into ordering again, since packaging it with meals would have cut delivery costs substantially. 3. Basically what im reading of your actions was you \"collaborated\" to test market, and then barged in It's one thing if you decided to make say, CHOCOLATE cheese cake or matcha, or something else. Doing the exact same item is just dishonorable.  I can go on. And dude, I dont even know this lady personally, I just like her cakes, and have a strong moral compass.  Now, if this was because the collaboration was unpleasant and u decide never to work with her again, that's another story altogether, and again I could afford further benefit of doubt there. But I've bought from her 3x and each time was nothing but pleasant so I find that hard to believe.",
