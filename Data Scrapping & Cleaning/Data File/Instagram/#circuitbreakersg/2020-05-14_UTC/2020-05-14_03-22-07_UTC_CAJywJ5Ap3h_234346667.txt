Pampering the family with a nicer breakfast this morning. Oven Baked French toast stuffed with dark chocolate, decked with fresh strawberries and creamy unsweetened mascarpone to tone the sweetness. Dust with some powder sugar no less. 
Used my home baked carrot crescent rolls (that’s also stuffed with chocolate 😂) which I baked yesterday. Nope there’s no carrot taste in them!

Best to use day old bread so it’ll be dryer to soak up all that custard. But you’re welcome to use store bought bread or even better croissants! Yum 😋 #ovenbakedfrenchtoast #frenchtoast
