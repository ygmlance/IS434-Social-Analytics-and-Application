Is #bakingathome something you do more of lately?

Decided to make my own creation of Mini Original-Nutella Burnt Cheesecake using Air Fryer. I reduces the sugar from the Original recipe given that nutella itself is sweet. Overall, it was smooth, creamy and thank goodness I have NUTELLA!

This was experimented on 4" springform pan so my daily consumption is limit to bite size. Absolutely nutella-licious!
