More time spent indoors doesn't keep our skin safe from UV damage! UVA rays can still pass through windows and penetrate deep into the dermis. This breaks down collagen and elastin, leading to accelerated premature skin ageing and wrinkle formation.⁣
⁣
UVA rays are not the only damaging light source in our #wfh situation too. HEV light or blue light — the light from devices like your phone or laptop — can get in the way of achieving youthful skin. Not only does increased exposure to blue light cause free radical damage, which leads to hyperpigmentation, it can also cause our circadian rhythm to be out-of-sync. This takes a toll on natural night-time repair as it tricks our skin cells into thinking it is daytime, leading to premature ageing or even dreaded dark eye circles. ⁣
⁣
A quick fix solution? Don’t ever skip sunscreen! If your sunscreen doesn’t include HEV light protection, amp up your UV defence effort with our UV protection range which includes all day UV protection and DNA repair enzymes that reverse sun damage. ⁣
