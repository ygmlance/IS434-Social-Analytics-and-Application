[Verdict: Terryfic 👍🏻] Ever thought of infusing burnt cheesecake into a croissant? Yes, you absolutely can. For Mother’s Day, Bakery Brera introduced their Burnt Cheese Croissant ($8.50). 🥐

And I was amazed how I could enjoy two pastries in one go. You get the bakery’s signature buttery, fragrant, flaky croissant combined with their popular rich, creamy burnt cheesecake. A multi-textured pastry indeed.

Like many others, I was thrilled that their burnt cheesecake was making a cameo appearance after they couldn’t sell cakes during the enhanced circuit breaker period. One thing is that it’s a feat to ensure the croissant retains its crisp exterior while the centre is filled with oozing cream cheese. And they did it.

While it was a limited edition item, I hope this will return to the shelves some day. But good news is that their burnt cheesecakes are now available again!
