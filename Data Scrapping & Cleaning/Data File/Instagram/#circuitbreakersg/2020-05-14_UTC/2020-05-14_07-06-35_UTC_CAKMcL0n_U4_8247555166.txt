#circuitbreaker day 38 breakfast situation today! ☀️
✨
Yay finally managed to call for McDelivery this morning. Got my favourite hotcakes, filet-o-fish, hashbrown, iced milo and coffee with milk. Delivery was prompt and came much earlier than the expected time. Food was delicious and my hotcakes were really fluffy and fragrant! Not sure if they replaced their margarine with whipped butter now, but the latter tasted really good. I’m still team hotcake syrup > whipped butter though! Such a hearty breakfast that I really enjoyed! 😋
