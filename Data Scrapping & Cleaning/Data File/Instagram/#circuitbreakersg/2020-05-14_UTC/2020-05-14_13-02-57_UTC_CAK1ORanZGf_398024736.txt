Another 2 more weeks to go for the CB to be lifted. Looking at the spread in the community, I think the CB measures are working well and situation is under control. Come 1 June, everyone should still take precaution and move things off slowly so that we can ensure that the CB does not come back to haunt us again. P/S: I am not swearing... CB = Circuit Breaker
