This covid season has put many of us in situations where you gotta find ways to cook for the family. Whether you are a noob cook or an experienced one, you will find a way to prepare your meals as you can’t be ordering in all the time.  Planning what to cook is a different ballgame from cooking itself - you have to think of the whole brood if they will eat what you cook and if not, you need to re think your menu again. The kitchen is also a place resembling a sauna for many so standing around for an hour or so to get meals ready is definitely not easy. So to all who are always getting fed from your grandma, grandpa, mum, dad, your spouse or helper, do take a few seconds of your time to give that loved one a hug (despite being sticky from perspiration), a pat on the shoulder or thank them verbally for the food prepared with love for you. Well done to all my IG cooking community friends. I salute you! 💪🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 #whatadeloves #adecooks #sglunch #macaronisoup #homecooked #food #foodpics #igfood #foodstagram #yummy #homecooking #sgfood #cooking #sgcook #chefathome #circuitbreakersg #eatathomesg #stayhomesg
