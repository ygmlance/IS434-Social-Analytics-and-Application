Back with another #illustratedmap ! This time hopping on the call by @theydrawandtravel to document our life during this pandemic. I’ve chosen to illustrate my grocery run because 1) I love grocery shopping 2) it’s the most exciting moment for me these days.
It’s funny to observe what’s essential to people now. Gone are the days of panic buying eggs, toilet paper, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies. I think my neighbourhood must be actively baking and watching korean shows because kimchi, tteokbokki and baking goods are flying off the shelves. In conversations with friends, we also get all excited talking about scoring hard-to-find commodities like Magnolia’s new brown sugar milk or our favourite chips flavour. This whole stay-home thing has also resulted in me snacking more late at night - and my current go to is flavoured soju and chips (to accompany my drama binge). This has been a fun piece to work on and I’m enjoying seeing all the stuff others around the world create for #mappingthismoment !
