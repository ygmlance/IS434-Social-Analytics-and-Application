Everyone wants to know what he did for my #stayhome birthday because everyone believes I’m married to the nicest husband ever (I’m a nice wife too ok?)... so here goes.. #1 At 12 midnight, I heard a really creepy sounding birthday song (seriously it was a really ominous arrangement!) by my ear. 👂 👻 He had set the song as his alarm and connected it to my Sonos speaker to play at 12 midnight. It was so brief and creepy that I wasn’t sure if it was a weird nightmare or reality the next morning 🙀

#2 When I got back from my morning run, sweaty, masked up and totally unglamorous (when am I ever glamorous anyway?! 😹), he shoved a beautiful bunches of roses at me and shouted Happy Birthday! 🌹 🎈 I asked him to make an exception for my birthday and let me give him a sweaty hug 🤗 and he screamed “nooooo” and ran away 💦 
#3 Ordered a HUGE “buffet spread” from Basilico @regentsingapore and laid it out nicely on our dining table! I got a shock when I saw it 🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀. #4 Lit my two birthday cakes, sang me a birthday song and laughed at me while I struggled to blow out the candles 🎂 
After taking photos, we went to eat in front of the TV instead, just the way we like it 😻

#5 Continued to bully and tease me for the rest of the night, just like he does Every. Single. Day. 😼😿 🤛🏻 Thanks @lennel for all the effort on my birthday, even though you know I never expect anything ❤️ and all the effort Every. Single. Day. I always say that if there was a lockdown, I much rather be locked down all alone, but there’s also no one else I rather spend my locked down days with! 💜

PS: Cannot wait for my real present this weekend 😉 😹
