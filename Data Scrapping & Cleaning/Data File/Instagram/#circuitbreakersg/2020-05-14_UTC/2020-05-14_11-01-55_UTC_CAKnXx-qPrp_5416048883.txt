Activity Thursday:🎨🏃🍳😘⠀
⠀
#1: Mood tracker progress check time! So you think we are just posting ideas? NO! We are in this together! Big confession: We just did up ours recently. Gravity and procrastination may be working extra hard, but taking the first step is all that matters. Put on your favourite playlist, gather all your materials, get comfortable and just start - you will be surprised by how fast time passes! Check out our video demo! ⠀
⠀
#2: It is more than the halfway mark of #circuitbreakersg you are either, super good at following online workouts OR you can be like Joey, lacking some motivation cause exercising ain't that exciting anymore. ⠀
Today, we bring to you RushARound by @jambavgames and Zombies,Run! by @zombiesrungame which are available on both iOS and Google Play #notsponsored do them both consecutively to get a real good workout in!⠀
Check out our IG Story and try to beat our score!⠀
⠀
#3: We were worried @kfc_sg might close. They didn't (phew!), but Joey already tested our Cheesy Meltz recipe so we'd like to share it with y'all (: Don't need to queue or pay for delivery😌get your ingredients during your grocery run, you can make quite a number of portions with it!⠀
