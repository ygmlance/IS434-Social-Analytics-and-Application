Onde Onde, everything from scratch, dough, pandan juice, gula melaka. The recipe says prep and cook time is tops 35mins. Why did I take 1.5 hours hahahah. I was struggling with the dough because it was so sticky to the fingers and the amount of additional flour i added was way pass the recipe then it finally became playdoh texture. again, I'm greedy so I overstuffed each ball with too much gula melaka, so explosion happened! Still good!
