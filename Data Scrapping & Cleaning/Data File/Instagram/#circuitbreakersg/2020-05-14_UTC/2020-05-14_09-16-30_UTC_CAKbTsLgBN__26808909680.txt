#throwback

See how I "fly" and how I asked Mummy to stand up and play ball with me 🤭 Mummy bought me a new #mathtoy which helps me to count. But I prefer to put everything on the scale to counting the little puppies properly 😝

Before I went to bed, Mummy filmed me saying byebye to Popo and sent it to Popo for her to replay if she misses me 😊
