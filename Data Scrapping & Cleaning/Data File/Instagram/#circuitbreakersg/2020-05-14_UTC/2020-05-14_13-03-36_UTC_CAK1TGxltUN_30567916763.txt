#circuitbreakersg day 38

One-pan roasted chicken thighs with assorted vegetable of egg plant, celery and mushrooms for dinner tonight. 🍗 🍆🌱

Pan seared the chicken thighs on the cast iron skillet to give the chicken skin a nice sear, did a quick stir fry of the vegetable in the same skillet, and then transferred the skillet into the oven for about 20 mins, and dinner is ready! ✌🏼

A quick and delicious dinner and I managed to clear some of the leftover vegetable in the fridge. 😃

I ordered coffee for the first time since circuit breaker started because I somehow felt a bit silly ordering coffee when I could just have coffee at home. But I decided to just indulge a little today and it was nice. ☕️ #gratitudediary
