#Circuitbreakersg day 38

Saw an inspiration quote from @vancouver.foodhunter post that I find very meaningful. So gonna share it here. * GIVE YOURSELF THE SAME CARE & ATTENTION TAT U GIVE TO OTHERS & WATCH YOURSELF BLOOM. •

Dinner today was the usual (albeit a bit boring 三菜一汤 : 🔺 Fried random fish
🔺Stir fry broccoli with mushroom
🔺 Luffa with vermicelli 🔺 The childhood soup - ABC soup ~
