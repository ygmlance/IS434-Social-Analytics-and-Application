Cir Breaker Day 38 Dinner.

Tahu Bergedil, 1 box of 10 with chicken, and 1 box of 10 with beef and cheese. Ordered from a hbb seller on the Bazaar Ramadhan Singapore 2020 FB page. Super yummy, especially after reheating in the toaster oven, and that sambal kicap is the mega bomb. Seller gave me an extra packet, gonna keep it to dip many many other dishes in future.
