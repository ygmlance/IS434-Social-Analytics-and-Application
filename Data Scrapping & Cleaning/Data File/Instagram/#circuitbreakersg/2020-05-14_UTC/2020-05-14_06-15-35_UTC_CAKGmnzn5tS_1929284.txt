CB Day 38 of 56. Don’t know what to cook so just apply the “First in First out” method. Created a Pumpkin Fried Rice with some meat and shrimps and pumpkin cubes as I mainly want to use up my pumpkin slice.  Just add some soya sauce and pepper according to my estimation and luckily it is taste good. The pumpkin cubes bring some sweetness to the dish. So no sugar is required  as seasoning.
