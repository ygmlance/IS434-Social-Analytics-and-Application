It's slated to rain all week here so a #sunshinestack ‚òÄÔ∏è seemed to be in order! These, in particular,  are books that left me with the gentle warmth of a late-afternoon sun.
.
What have you guys been doing to let a little light in? I started on my new embroidery kit yesterday! Did NOT have a good time figuring out the hoop, the bolt was stuck and I have a blister on my right thumb üôÉ. I'd also been book shopping on Book Xcess! Books are 50-80% off year-round and shipping to Singapore has a flat fee of 50RM right now (with no minimum purchase!!). I wish it had a better selection of classics, though. I ended up picking A Thirst for Love by Mishima and The Leavers by Lisa Ko!
.
If you guys are doing a little shopping of your own and are a suckerrrr for nice covers, A Sting in the Tale would be my recommendation. It's a non-fiction memoir by Dave Goulson on his lifelong passion for bumblebees. You can hate insects, like I do, but tell me you don't want to read a wholesome old man making entology sound like the Hundred Acre Woods üêù You can't tell from this angle, but I have so many page tabs sticking out from bits that made me legitimately chortle. Who chortles in real life? Me, reading this book, apparently. 10/10 for bedtime reading.

Thank you @bookxcess for the collaboration!
