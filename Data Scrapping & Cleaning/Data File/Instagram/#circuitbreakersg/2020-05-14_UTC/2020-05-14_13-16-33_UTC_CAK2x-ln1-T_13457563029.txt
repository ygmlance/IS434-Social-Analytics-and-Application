Some math fun this week - 📏Measure the height and colour the corresponding squares!
.
I introduced 👧🏻 to the concept of units and added a fun twist by drawing these @mrmenofficial characters. All she needed to do was to gauge their height in squares.
.
You can choose to draw anything you want to for this activity. Swipe ⬅️ to see how this can be easily replicated. (Don’t be confused by the purple square in the next picture. 😅 My little girl made a mistake and tried to undo the error by recounting with brown crayon).
.
Don’t have a ruler to help you draw squares? Use square cubes (eg. LEGO) to measure as they can also serve as non-standard units of measurement.
.
This exercise will make a wonderful introduction to the concept of standard units (eg. centimeters).
