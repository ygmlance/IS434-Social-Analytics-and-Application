I never really knew this halibut fish until a sales at @songfishsg introduced me. Just encouraging me to try something special (yes I get most of my seafood from them). But I totally fell in love with this fish! Itâ€™s nice no matter how you cook it. Today I pan seared it and topped with lemon butter sauce. Enjoy!
