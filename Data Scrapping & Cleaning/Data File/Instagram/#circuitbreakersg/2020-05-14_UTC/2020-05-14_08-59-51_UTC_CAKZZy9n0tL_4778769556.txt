Hump day made all the better with a Saké On-Nomi session with Adrian Goh and friends. This is @interriceasia 3rd On-Nomi and they will probably have 1 more before the end of #circuitbreaker . I hear it’s a full Daiginjo tasting ✌️. .
Interrice packs the 5 Saké into tasting portions (80ml portions) and delivered to you on the day of the On-Nomi. You can also get the full bottle set at a discounted price, check their website for deets.
.
For On-Nomi #3, the theme was 5 Saké from 5 prefectures, highlighting the uniqueness of the region. The pack consisted of.
.
@toko_sake_en Daiginjo Yamadanishiki (2014 IWC Trophy winner for its category).
.
@obatashuzo_manotsuru Junmai Cho-Karakuchi.
.
@keigetsu_tosabrewingcompany CEL58 Aikawa Homare Junmai Yamahai.
.
@gozenshu Junmai Nigori Bodaimoto.
.
Hanahato Kijoshu 8 years aged sake.
.
I thoroughly enjoyed myself with enthusiasts and novice coming together, drinking and passionately discussing, amongst other things, the preference for Nigori Saké and Toko’s discontinuation of the Daiginjo Yamadanishiki because of its conversion to an all Junmai brewery. Never a dull moment.
.
Adrian does these sessions purely for passion, to educate more people about Saké, to make it more accessible to everyone. Look out on their website, FB and IG for deets on the next one.
.
It makes the #circuitbreaker a lot more palatable.
