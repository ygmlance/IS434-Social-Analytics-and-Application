I’m more of a wine person but bestie is a big sake lover. So when I saw @kamoshita5neilroad promoting the “hard to find” #juyondai tasting set, I knew I had to get it for her. .

We’ve always wanted to (re)visit Kamoshita especially on the 14th of the month as they’d have the Juyondai by glass but we never could seem to find time nor sync our calendars. So maybe it’s thanks to #circuitbreakersg we can have this now, though virtually.

Kanpai!
