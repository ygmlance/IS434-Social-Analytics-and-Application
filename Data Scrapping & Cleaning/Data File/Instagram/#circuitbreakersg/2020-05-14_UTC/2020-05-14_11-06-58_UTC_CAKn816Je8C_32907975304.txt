Kuning (not selar) as it’s been pointed out to me recently, is a great fish to fry with salt and pepper or some tumeric. Allow me to give it some loving. Done well, the head is the best part. Really crispy. What is not in post is also bak kut teh with tungoh and pacific clams and bittersweet durian (奶油).
