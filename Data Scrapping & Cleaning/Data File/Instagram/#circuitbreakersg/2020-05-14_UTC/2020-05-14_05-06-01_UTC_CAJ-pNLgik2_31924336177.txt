🥡Hakka Abacus Seeds (算盘子）
_________________________
✍🏻Totally love it when mum decides to make Hakka Abacus Seeds! It is a Traditional Hakka dish that is usually eaten during Chinese New Year because it symbolises that you will have lots of money for the coming year (as Chinese traditionally use abacus as calculators)!
.
For me, I just love all food that uses yam as an ingredient 🤤
