ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ SG Food: #throwbackthursday Took a break from cooking and we ordered Ginger Spring Onion Frog Legs from @lor9.co along with BBQ Stingray, Hot Plate Oyster Omelette and Fried Garlic Frog Legs. It has been a while since we last had all these and thankfully they do islandwide delivery with a flat fee of S$7. Free delivery above S$70 #hzfooddiary #lor9
