Our 2nd bake on the menu is dubbed the Fresher's Incredible Low Carb (yet Rich!) Japanese Cheesecake.
.
When the kitchen settles down at night, it’s our cue to work on fine tuning our version of a sugar-free, gluten-free cheesecake. Taken at nearly close to midnight and right before we switched the temperatures (yes, baking in a force fan combi oven is almost impossible, and took a gazillion tweaks to achieve the right cheesecake texture), lies a single lone cheesecake with hopes of it being the “one”.
.
We finally settled on our version of a recipe that offers a good mouthful of dense, rich cheese, yet is still reminisce of the iconic Japanese soufflé like texture.
.
While this is greatly inspired by many #keto conscious bakers our there, we’d like to shoutout to fellow small business owner @soulmyeketo who has been our biggest inspiration for sugar free bakes yet, and huge thank you to the friends of @soulmyeketo for you guys’ support too!
