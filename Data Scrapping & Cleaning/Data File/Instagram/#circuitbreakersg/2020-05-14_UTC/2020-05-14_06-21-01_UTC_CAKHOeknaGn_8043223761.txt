We really love drawing with @rbiddulph! These are the art pieces we have drawn since the start of the school holidays and we look forward to his lessons every week!

Join Rob as he attempts to break the world record for the largest online art lesson on 21 May, 4pm BST (11pm in Singapore). The meaningful challenge aims to raise money for charities working in the fight against Covid-19. Mummy will attend the online lesson on our behalf as we will probably be in dreamland. But it's ok, she will teach us when we are up the next day! What's more important is to support this wonderful initiative. It's simple, just sign up at www.artworldrecords.com and attend the online lesson. If it's within your means, please make a donation too. Every little bit counts. Thank you!
