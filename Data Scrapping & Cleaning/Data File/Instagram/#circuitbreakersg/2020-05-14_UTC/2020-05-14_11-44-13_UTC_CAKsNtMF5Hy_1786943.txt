Haha just kidding~ this was just a different way of doing one of the drinks I've been making recently. It looks abit like eggs right! ⁣

It's actually a menu item in a Korean cafe! So I tried to replicate it as well haha.⁣

Maybe you can guess what this actually is! Will be uploading the actual drink in the future 😊😆 ⁣
