#CircuitBreakerSg Day 38! Todayâ€™s #WFH brunch was homemade Yam Cake! Made with my leftover yam from last cooking. Recipe adapted from @themeatmensg, I just added some shaoxing wine, sesame oil and reduced 5 spice powder to a pinch. Love this recipe, loaded with yam and lesser flour. Pretty yummy! ðŸ˜‹
