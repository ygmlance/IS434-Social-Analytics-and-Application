Ordered in a feast from The Feather Blade ðŸ¥©
.
Favourites: the 200g signature steaks on a bed of mashed potatoes were tender and juicy. We ordered a medium and a medium rare- both were cooked to the appropriate doneness. The juicy, quite-melt-in-the-mouth minced meat patty complemented the slightly charred brioche bun with shallots. The piece of creamy foie gras added a touch of indulgence.
