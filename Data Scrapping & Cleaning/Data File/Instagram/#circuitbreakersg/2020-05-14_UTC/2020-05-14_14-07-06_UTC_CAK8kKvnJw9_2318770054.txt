[We're nearing the weekends and I've got a simple recipe that you can try at any time of the day during #stayhomesg ✨]
This stay home period makes me visit the kitchen so much more often, I'm sure you too right — be it cooking, baking or just checking out the fridge 😛🙌🏻 Ok that's all from me, lets dive into this filling, superfood-packed + gluten-free & vegan inspired recipe!

🥜🍌𝐏𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐭 𝐁𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐚 𝐒𝗺𝗼𝗼𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐞 𝐁𝗼𝐰𝐥 🥣

𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 [𝗺𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 1 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠]:
Banana (2 frozen to blend, 1 room temp for garnishing)
Almond Milk (1/3 cup)
Peanut Butter (1 tbsp)
Dry fruits (of your choice for garnishing)
Vanilla Essence (2 drops) *optional
Chia seeds (2 tbsp to blend) *optional
Cocoa powder (2 tbsp) *optional

𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 :

Blend the frozen banana along with the almond milk, chia seeds, vanilla essence and peanut butter last. You need to have a thick constancy and see a smooth texture. Pour it in your favourite bowl and top it off with more banana slices, chia seeds and chocolate granola if you like and, voilà your smoothie bowl is ready 🤗
