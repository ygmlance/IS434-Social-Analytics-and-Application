#Circuitbreakersg Day 38
.
The Covid-19 lockdowns have affected many globally. Work aside, not being able to do what one wants can leave one with a feeling of helplessness. Even just having the option to do something I want previously, has been taken for granted
.
Now that I am not able to sit and enjoy a meal at the hawker centre, borrow magazines from the library, hang out with loved ones & especially not being able to see this little one (our trip had to be cancelled, of course), life can sometimes seem aimless
.
While we look forward to the end of the circuit breaker, news of resurgence in some countries also cause us worry
.
Remember to keep your loved ones close at heart and make sure you never let them feel that they are alone ðŸ’•
