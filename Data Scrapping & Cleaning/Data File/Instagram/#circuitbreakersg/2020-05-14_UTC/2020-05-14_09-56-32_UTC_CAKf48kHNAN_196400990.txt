Dinner this evening, was early, and in two parts, because i was strangely very hungry! Dinner part one, was a Pan-fried Chicken Chop with Genting Gardenâ€™s Classic Mixed Salad dressed with a Blueberry Vinaigrette, and Marinated Cherry Tomatoes in EVOO, Maldon Sea Salt flakes and freshly ground Kampot red peppercorns. The second part of dinner, was Steamed Cabbage Rice, which had cabbage in square cut, chopped carrots, fried minced pork, fishcake cubes, sliced lap cheong, or Chinese Sausage, lard cubes, and was seasoned with both light and dark superior soya sauce, and a swirl of lard oil before cooking in the rice cooker. I did forget that i had meant to put in some dried shrimp and shiitake mushrooms, but after eating all that, you could say that i was finally satisfied! ðŸ˜… #chickenchopsalad #cabbagerice #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
