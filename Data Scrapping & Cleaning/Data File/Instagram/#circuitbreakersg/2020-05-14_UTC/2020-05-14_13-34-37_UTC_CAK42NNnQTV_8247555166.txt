Cooked porridge for dinner tonight! 🥢
✨
Prepared simple dishes consisting of gochujang red grouper, steamed otah and braised eggs. Served with sweet potato porridge! Red grouper and otah from @9sseafood which are so fresh and good as usual. 🐟🌶🥚
✨
All plated in tableware from @luzerneglobal’s Tin Tin collection. This is the collection which we have the most tableware of. Cos Mum really loves it as it’s like enamelware. So classic and timeless! 😊 #stayhomewithluzerne
