Pan Fried Salmon with Asparagus and Mash

Salmon
1. Skin side up, push the 2 sides of the salmon fillet so the center rolls up to a curl. Gently slicing cuts through the skin of the salmon so it stays completely flat when frying on pan
2. Season both sides generously with salt, pepper and spices (I used Cajun spices)
3. Hot pan, medium heat. 3 tbsp olive oil, salmon in, skin side down. Fry for about 3 mins. You will see very clearly the salmon gets cooked upwards. 
4. When about half cooked, flip it over and fry for about 2 mins 
5. Put in 2 tbsp butter and thyme for flavor, this time flipping the salmon skin side down.
6. Baste the salmon with melted butter 
Mash
7. 2 -3 large potatoes, skin peels, chopped. Put into large pot of water with salt, boil until soften 
8. Prepare butter milk mix: - saucepan low to med heat
- 120g butter (butter to potato weight ratio 1:3)
- 100ml milk
- 3 cloves mash garlic
- mix well in low to medium heat
9. When potatoes soft enough (fork them and if they fall off easily, itâ€™s good to go), drain water and mash them on the same pot
10. Low heat, continue mashing while pouring 1/4 of butter milk mix inside. Repeat until all butter milk used up. Switch to a whisk for better and creamier texture

Asparagus
11. Prepare asparagus with tail chopped and lay evenly on oven pan. (Trick: hold 2 ends of asparagus, bend until break. The breaking point is where you should chop the rest of the stalks away) 
12. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil on top
13. Pop into hot oven for 5-8 minutes depending on thickness of asparagus 
14. Serve mash on plate, lay asparagus, followed by salmon on top
