I was really craving claypot rice today so I whipped up a cheat version of #claypotrice for dinner. All I did was fry some Chinese sausage, chicken thighs (well-marinated with ginger juice, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and Shao Xing wine) and canned button mushrooms and uncooked rice grains till fragrant. And then pour everything into the rice cooker, add some water and then leave the rice cooker do all the magic. I think one of my most favourite foods in sg is claypot rice and I cannot wait for the circuit breaker to end so I can have real claypot rice again..👩🏻‍🍳 #stayhome #sgunited #foodstagram #homecooking #sgeats #circuitbreakersg
