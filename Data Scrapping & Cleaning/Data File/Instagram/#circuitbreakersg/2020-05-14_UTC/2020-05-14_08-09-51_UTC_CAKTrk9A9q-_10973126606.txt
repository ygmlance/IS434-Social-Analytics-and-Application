Does Nutella and Cheese seem like an unusual pairing? If I never try, I will never know. I find the sweet and savory combo goes very well together.

Featuring my absolutely nutella-licious gluten free breakfast.

1⃣ Orgran Chia Crispbread
2⃣ President Rondele Spreadable Cheese Garlic & Herbs
3⃣ Nutella

Indeed, gluten free food is not for everyone. FYI, my mom remarked that I'm eating "plastic" biscuit.
