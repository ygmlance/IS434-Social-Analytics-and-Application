Dinner. #milanese #porkchops with #tagliatelle dressed with #butter and #parmiggianoreggiano 
The #pork was from @hubersbutchery from one of our #groceryrun and retrieved #fromthefreezer 
A wedge of #lemon and a dollop of #mustard to complete the meal. Could have done with a nice crisp Prosecco but silly me forgot that we did actually have a bottle chilling in the fridge.
