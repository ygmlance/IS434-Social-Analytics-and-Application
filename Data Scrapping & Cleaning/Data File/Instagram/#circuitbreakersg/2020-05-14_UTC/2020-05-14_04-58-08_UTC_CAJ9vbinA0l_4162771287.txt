Day 38 of circuit breaker (14/5/2020).
.
My last wholemeal soft bun! Is really good!
.
I toasted it with the unsalted peanut butter and cheese... soft and chewy with the best topping combination (for me lah😁). Plus a nice hot coffee without sugar! 
Simple comfort food. 😋🥯🧀🥜☕
.
Thankful and enjoying the simplicity of life! 🤗🙏
