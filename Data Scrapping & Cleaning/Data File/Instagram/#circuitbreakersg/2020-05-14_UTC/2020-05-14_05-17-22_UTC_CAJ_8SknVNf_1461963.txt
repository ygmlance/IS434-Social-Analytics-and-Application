Day 38 of CB - Finally had time to make ramen for lunch. Technically the process was spread over 2 days since char siu was made a whole 24 hours in advance. The ajitsuke tamago only had 1 hour soaking time instead of my preferred 2 cos not enough time this morning ðŸ˜´ but it was good enough for the fam. Tonkatsu soup was a concentrated stock that I reconstituted, from a Japanese grocery store that also sells ramen. Not the best but when youâ€™re in a pinch, itâ€™s a good substitute #homecooked #circuitbreakersg #umamilicious
