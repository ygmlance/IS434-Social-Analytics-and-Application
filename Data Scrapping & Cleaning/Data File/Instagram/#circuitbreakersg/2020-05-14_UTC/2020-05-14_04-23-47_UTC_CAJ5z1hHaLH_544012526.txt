What do you like to eat for breakfast?
.
My new love is the @kelloggssingapore new Special K Blueberry & Almond
. 
A bowl of nutritious goodness! The naturally Flavoured Flakes together with sliced almonds and Natural dried juicy blueberries are perfect match. . I usually eat with milk or yoghurt. You can even eat as a snack or topping on salad! Best of all, No Preservatives!
