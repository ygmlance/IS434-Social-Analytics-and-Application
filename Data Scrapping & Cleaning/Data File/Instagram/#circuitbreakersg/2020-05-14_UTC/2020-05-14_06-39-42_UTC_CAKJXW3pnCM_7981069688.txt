Thad Jones - Detroit-New York Junction, 1956. Called ‘one of the all-time greatest jazz trumpet soloist’ Thad made his mark in the Count Basie Orchestra where he was the soloist in some of Basie’s most well-known tunes. #thadjones #kennyburrell #billymitchell and #tommyflanagan were all from Detroit which explains the title. The music on this album has that crossover sound and feel from orchestra jazz to small group which makes it abit different. Thad himself has a distinctive sound and it’s worth checking this out when you need some time out from 60s Blue Note sound.  #detroitnewyorkjunction #oscarpettiford #shadowwilson #bluenoterecords
