What started out as an experiment a couple of weeks ago, turned into a full on request from my mum. This dish was inspired by @ciaosamin’s miso braised short ribs as seen on @saltfatacidheat. As fancy as these look, they only cost me $11 each from @coldstoragesg and comfortably fed 3+ persons!

Instead of braising them in the oven, I opted for a 12hr sous vide which helped me combine both marinading and cooking time required. The marinade consisted of brown sugar, mirin, soy, grated garlic and ginger, a dash of cayenne pepper and a touch of miso for good measure.
.

After the sous vide, I torched the ribs to finish, whilst I separated and saved the bag juices (skimming the excess fat off) and reduced it to something of a demi-glaze consistency with a splash of rice vinegar for brushing over after.

I served the ribs over fluffy Japanese rice topped with some furikake along with a side of sunomono (seasoned Japanese cucumber). The short ribs were spoon (yes, spoon) tender, but I’m definitely gonna try for a 24hr sous vide before the #circuibreakersg’s over.
