oyako-don for lunch today. sous vide egg was destroyed in the process...wanted to hide it for the gram, but decided to keep it real ðŸ¤ª used brown rice instead of white rice, taste is not compromised at all! #stayhomewithascott #homecooked #covidcooking #oyakodon #circuitbreakersg #brownrice #chickenandegg #japanesericebowl #sghomecooking
