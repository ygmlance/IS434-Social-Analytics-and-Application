Tonight we had local fusion from a neighbourhood restaurant we used to frequent, The Wine and Gourmet Friends in Outram (@twgfriends). We had the Har Cheong Kai Karaage, Otah Hamachi Collar, Rendang Beef Brisket and Truffle Chicken with Foie Gras. It was a highly satisfying and well-executed meal. The uniquely-prepared Otah was definitely a standout! Ordered via @deliveroo_sg.
