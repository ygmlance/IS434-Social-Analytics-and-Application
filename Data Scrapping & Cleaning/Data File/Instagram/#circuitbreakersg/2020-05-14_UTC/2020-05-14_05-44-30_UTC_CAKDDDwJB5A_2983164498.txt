iâ€™ve been craving Japanese way too much so iâ€™ve decided to recreate some simple meals at home (lazy style) with matcha soba (mixed with a spoonful of sesame oil), cucumbers, broccoli and unagi!!! (bought ofc)

for a stronger flavour, i added japanese soy dressing onto the veg as well as some sesame seeds for that added taste ðŸ˜‹ overall, main star of the show is still the unagi! itâ€™s softness and flavour is amazing ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜­ #homemadelunch #lunch #japanesefood #simplejapanesefood #simplemeal #quickmeals #mealideas #circuitbreakersg #sgfoodie #sgfoodover #sg #foodie #goodfoodie #goodfoodfeed #unagi #matchasoba #mealsinspiration #health #healthy #healthylifestyle #healthyfoodrecipes #healthyliving #healthyeating
