DIY FABRIC SOFTENER 
It has been a few years since I've used conventional fabric softener.
⠀⠀
Our clothes & bedsheets are truly softer and do not smell like they have come out of a commercial chemist's lab. ⠀⠀
I use distilled white vinegar and I can honestly say it's one of the best swaps I've ever had to make. White vinegar costs practically nothing and can be gotten at bulk stores like @scoopwholefoods_sg ⠀⠀
It feels like all my clothes feel softer and cleaner against my skin. Together with soap nuts and natural laundry washing soda, this is our winning combination. ⠀⠀
I've tossed some lemon peels & springs of rosemary in them, as well as 5 drops of Purification Essential Oils.  Just add about 50ML-100ML depending on the load, and voila! Try this for a few weeks (together with my natural laundry soap recipe) and I am confident you will never go back to using any other toxic detergents!

When you give this a go, I would love to hear your results in my comments below! ⠀⠀
