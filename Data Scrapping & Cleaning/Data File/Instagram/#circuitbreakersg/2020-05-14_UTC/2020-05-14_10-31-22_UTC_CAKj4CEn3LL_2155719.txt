I have cooked a well known dish across the world. I eat it since my childhood and many people love this dish especially my household. 
This is a classic Cantonese dish and it’s Sweet and Sour Pork 咕噜肉!
It is a chinese stir-fry dish made with juicy pieces of pork belly, bell peppers, onion, and pineapple. Battered pork gets fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet and tangy sauce. I dislike thick batter so I will keep it as thin as possible so that I will bite into the meat rather than the batter. 
It is such a ultimate comfort food and I love the aroma so much. 
My stomach is growling. Time for dinner!
