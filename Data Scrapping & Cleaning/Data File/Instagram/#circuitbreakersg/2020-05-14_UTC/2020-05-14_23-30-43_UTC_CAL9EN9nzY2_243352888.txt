📹Trying new things during this CB, since the whole world calls it “unprecedented” 💪🏼
.
✒️ Dee and I met 3 years ago when I was looking for a calligrapher for a skincare event I was hosting. She was prepared (with her paints), crystal clear on her ‘why’ and made me laugh. It was the perfect first date 🥰
.
👯‍♀️Since then, we’ve worked on a few campaigns together, met each other’s partners and karaoked twice to Adele and Anna (from Frozen) 🎶
.
We were Skyping last weekend about chickens, creativity and COVID and thought: Maybe other people would like to be chatting and laughing with us too. So we put on our big girl pants and decided to go live and spread some happy chatty energy around on our first IG Live!✨💖✨
.
💄I’ll be wearing makeup and real clothes for the first time in a month, so I hope they fit! 🙊
.
If you’re up for a chilled out Friday laughing with us and having the power to choose ice breaker questions for us to answer, join us at 9pm on IG Live later tonight 😃
.
⏰Set a reminder in your calendar and see you soon! 😘

PS: HOW DO YOU LIKE OUR COMBINED NAME??? #PositiveDeePeilin 😍😍😍
