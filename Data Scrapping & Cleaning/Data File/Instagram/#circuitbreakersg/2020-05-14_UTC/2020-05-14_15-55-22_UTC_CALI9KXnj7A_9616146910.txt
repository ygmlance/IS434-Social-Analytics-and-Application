In the spirit of making things even better the next go around, I decided to reboot the banana bread I baked back in 2019. Don’t get me wrong, it was ok, but I felt it could do with a few tweaks to get it to where it needed to be.

A new addition to my appliance family was a hand mixer, this helped cream the fat and sugar a lot more efficiently than when I did it fully by hand. The added air whipped into the mix in the process also contributed to better lift overall. I dusted the top with some Demerara sugar and flaky salt (new addition) for a bomb tasting crust.

There’s still some room for improvement with one or two infrastructure changes (i.e. a newer oven etc), but this really hit the spot for me with a generous spread of clotted cream and flaky salt to finish.
