Each cup of kombucha takes about 3 weeks to make and undergoes two stages of fermentation. In the first stage of fermentation, our mother SCOBY is introduced to brewed tea and fed with sugar. A symbiotic environment starts to be formed. The SCOBY relies on the sugar and tea to survive and produces a baby SCOBY! Beneficial by-products such as good bacteria and yeast is produced. Other acids and esters are part of the wide range of nutrients that contribute to our kombuchaâ€™s unique tangy taste. 
Once our kombucha is ready, we take out the SCOBY and add fresh fruits and spices to begin the second stage of fermentation! For the next 5 days, the flavours from our ingredients fuse with our kombucha to give a richer, more complex flavour.
