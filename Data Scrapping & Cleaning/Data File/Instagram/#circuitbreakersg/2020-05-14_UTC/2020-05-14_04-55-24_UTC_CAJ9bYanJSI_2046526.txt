It’s been crazy hard trying to motivate myself to workout from home during this Circuit Breaker, but I don’t wait for the mood to strike. I just change into my workout outfit, assemble my weights, and hit it! 💪🏼 Great music helps - in my playlist are Alan Walker, Marsmello, Loud Luxury, Zedd, Dynoro 🎵🎶 There’s little we can do during this pandemic but to wait it out - and ensuring we keep ourselves happy & healthy while at it 😄❤️ #covid19 #coronavirus #singapore #sg #sgcircuitbreaker  #circuitbreakersg #homeworkout #stayhome #weights #strengthtraining #resistanceband #yogamat #weightliftinggloves #fitfam #stayfit #letsgetstart #letsgetsweat #strong #doyouevenlift #fitness #fitspo
