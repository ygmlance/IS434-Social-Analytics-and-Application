; {Circuit Breaker Day 38}

Maybe we are too obsessed in taking the perfect picture, the perfect food/bake for social media these days?

Havenâ€™t had an epic baking fail in a long time, so this was quite a funny experience ðŸ˜‚ So I plopped my high hydration bread dough into my pullman tin, lid on, think itâ€™ll be a nice pullman loaf. Turns out I was very wrong hahaha. Dough was spewing out of the loaf, and onto the oven floor and grill. Threw away the scraps, removed the lid, and baked whatever was left in the pan. Tada.

Still smells good though. Back to the drawing board.
