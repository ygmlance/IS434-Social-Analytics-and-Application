#circuitbreakersg : ğŸ¦‹ Relaxed and Grateful for the day ğŸ¦‹

Todayâ€™s been a self realisation day about how on the positive this kind of lockdown has pushed everyone to be more attached with the family and loved ones. Though the day is been busy working from home and in the meantime preparing meals for the loved ones, felt grateful for this time. Prepared this special brinjal curry which is calcium and protein rich and is one of my Husbandâ€™s fave, soon will share the recipe with you all.
