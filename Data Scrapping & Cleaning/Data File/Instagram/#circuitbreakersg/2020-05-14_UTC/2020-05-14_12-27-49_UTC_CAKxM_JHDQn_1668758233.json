Japanese Cheesecake.\n.\nWhen the kitchen settles down at night, it\u2019s our cue to work on fine tuning our version of a sugar-free, gluten-free cheesecake. Taken at nearly close to midnight and right before we switched the temperatures (yes, baking in a force fan combi oven is almost impossible, and took a gazillion tweaks to achieve the right cheesecake texture), lies a single lone cheesecake with hopes of it being the \u201cone\u201d.\n.\nWe finally settled on our version of a recipe that offers a good mouthful of dense, rich cheese, yet is still reminisce of the iconic Japanese souffle\u0301 like texture.\n.\nWhile this is greatly inspired by many #keto conscious bakers our there, we\u2019d like to shoutout to fellow small business owner @soulmyeketo who has been our biggest inspiration for sugar free bakes yet, and huge thank you to the friends of @soulmyeketo for you guys\u2019 support too!\n.\nWe\u2019ve got more food and bakes to come, made 100% from scratch in our little central kitchen to yours. // This cake is available now at $2 OFF. \nPair them with our keto-friendly meals for Free Islandwide Delivery.

I think. stop it la. I really try to be v patient but u all keep using unfair conjectures. I'm not angry at fresher for selling cheesecake or the lemonturdmuffin thing. Its about the way its done, how hard is it to understand that? At the start they nv tell ppl. Now edit already, send army of trolls to ppl who spark the edit. And... It's not even obvious that the pic they post on their website is a pic of a cake THEY baked leh. Cuz if it's not, then potentially misselling cuz that cake sho pretty. But im sure fresher can bake a prettier one since all the recipes on the internet seem to show pretty cakes only. But ultimately. Case closed.  I wont buy from fresher, u probably wont buy from the baker, we all made our cases, conclusion is we have different morale standards, we draw different lines, and hats off to Claire for keeping this thread open bu5 shame on youfor not just apologising (which frankly, resolves everything)",

I came here on my own accord. If you wanna say fresher sent us, then is it fair for me to say SMK sent an army of trolls like you here? 5. They didn\u2019t do 1001 nice things in covid. Let me explain the situation to you since you wanna know. DURING COVID 19 @leehsienloong say home Bakers cannot do business. So SMK cannot sell correct? So how? fresher ownself bake.

OR an intent to somehow \"relate\" or \"imply\" that their product is same as SMK? (eg. If I said, I made a drink hugely inspired by Coca Cola, whats the first thing that cross your mind? Definitely not a fruit juice) And it's this reference to SMK and their refusal to address it that is causing all this issue. Going into other details are just trying to divert us from the main point. Which is \"what's the point of drawing reference to SMK?\" you want to promote business to SMK cakes because you are making your own now? I'm sure as savvy business owners who knows how to trim and cut cost (hopefully not at the expense of cutting quality) to make profit, you can't be making a product while promoting your competitors one right?",

Since the beginning when Fresher introduce the cheesecake as dessert, I was informed by Claire that this cheesecake was a product of their partner, the cheesecake was supplied by their partner and was not made by Fresher. She further confirms verbally with me during our chanced meetup at a gym when she was venturing into providing healthy meals to gym goers. In no way did she steal all the credits from the supplier or mislead me into thinking that the cheesecake is a product of Fresher. I believed she have been outright truthful in how the cheesecake came about as part of their effort to provide healthy meals. I had liked the part when they decided venturing into producing their own version of cheesecake, and I have faith & belief that Fresher and Claire is not morally unethical into stealing their supplier's product. Rather, I believe its their own focus to trial n error venture approach into new business model. This is the Fresher and Claire I know since the start from 5-6 years ago. They are continuously experimenting and adventurous in the development of new receipes. To those who decides not to order from Fresher, I thank you cuz it means I will  face lesser competition with my orders (imagine my exasperation when food is out of stock!). To Fresher, you will have my continued support. Going the thorny path of success isn't easy, but keep in faith and be  morally ethical as you always have been. Cheers. You won't lost a customer in me just cause of this saga.",

When I needed help with details on keto diet they were always prompt to help me. I feel things were taken out of context by their cheese cake supplier and I never thought that they were cheating me in anyway, in fact I do own a business involving F&B so I do not feel like they did anything malicious or unethical like how people are claiming them to be. To people who are thinking of working with others, put some thought into knowing who you are working with so that you don\u2019t end up in this situation, after giving your best in the business. The feeling must suck to be involved in this unnecessary drama and to be blamed for something you didn\u2019t do wrong but I will continue to support Fresher all the way, even more after this \u2764\ufe0f",
