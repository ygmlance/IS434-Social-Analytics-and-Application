🏡 Successfully Upgraded from 3-RM to 4-RM 🏡⠀
⠀
In this family of 4, Hubby is the sole breadwinner. Their 3-RM flat is getting a bit small for their growing family. They are looking to upgrade to have an additional bedroom so that the son and daughter can each have their own room. They also need more space for better living and study environment for the kids.⠀
⠀
While #househunting, it was difficult to find a suitable unit for them within a tight budget. Also, some units were affected by the Ethnic Quota, where Malay race Buyers can't purchase the unit.⠀
⠀
However after much searching, I finally found a 4-RM flat perfect for this lovely family. It's within the same estate and near to the children's school. And not forgetting that they are not required to top-up cash for their monthly instalment❗️Alhamdulillah..⠀
⠀
Thank you to Agent Den Irya from Propnex for bringing his buyer to close the deal and for the smooth completion process throughout❗️⠀
