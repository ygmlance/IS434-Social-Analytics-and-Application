[Make Kindness a Habit, Even During A Crisis]

When the COVID-19 crisis hit us, we were initially unsure on how to continue our micro-volunteering activities. A high percentage of our time was spent volunteering in-person by engaging and building connections with residents of the Homes, dialysis patients at NKF, Singapore Prison Service @captainsoflives , volunteers at our #craftforgood sessions and showing appreciation and kindness to various 'less visible' communities.

It then became clear to us that we had to shift our interactions with volunteers and residents of the Homes to the digital space. We offered our resource of accessible painting sessions to @societystaples , who put up an online platform of resources for the special needs community. We also collected online encouragement messages for the communities that received our care packs.

New partners have been linked up with us to support their needs, including @vivafoundation , @brightvisionch and Outram Community Hospital. Before circuit breaker, we packed 7000 care packs for @tantocksenghospital (TTSH) and National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) staff. During circuit breaker, we packed 380 care packs for BVH staff and 250 care packs for staff of welfare and adult disability homes. We also ran a fundraising campaign for Super Mums (with children with special needs). After circuit breaker, we will pack and deliver 500 care packs for Outram Community Hospital staff and over 1000 care packs for MRT station staff and cleaners.

We are in the midst of creating stay well packs for @nkfsg dialysis patients and BVH patients, and storybook activity kits for children who are hospitalized. Other projects are in the works. Thank you all volunteers, sponsors and grant makers for showing that we can come together to continue our acts of kindness, even during a global healthcare crisis. Keep safe and stay well, everyone. #BeKindSG #SGUnited #SGCares #CityofGood #BeGreaterSG #stayhomeforsg
