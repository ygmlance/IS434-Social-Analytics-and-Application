I go through phases of research and readings according to the "season" our family is in. I bought Tranquil during my "desperate for sleep" season when Harling was around 9 months old. I tried ALL kinds of oils for sleep support. Even Rutavala, guys. Yes, the one that smells like stinky socks. I have only tried Tranquil a few times and didn't see the effects on my child so I let it sit on my shelf. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
We used others (Cedarwood, Ruta, Peace and Calming, White Angelica, even Raven) before finding that Sleepyize worked for Harling really well and when I ran out of it and had to wait for delayed shipment from the US (erm, thanks COVID-19). I went back to my shelf and reached out for other sleep support oils when my hand grabbed Tranquil. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Guys. It was the best sleep I have EVER had that night. It was so peaceful, I barely woke up in the middle of the night. I think it's about time I incorporate this roller into MY OWN bedtime routine. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
A few ideas how we can keep our oils close to us and when to use Tranquil roll-on:â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
ðŸŒ¿Keep a roll-on in your bag or the kidsâ€™ backpacks for busy work or test days.â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
ðŸŒ¿Put it on your dresser and apply Tranquil to the bottoms of feet during evening routines.â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
ðŸŒ¿Inhale or roll Tranquil over your heart during troubling times for a centering aroma.â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
ðŸŒ¿Wind down after a hectic day by applying Tranquil to your neck or shoulders, then massage for 20â€“30 seconds. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
