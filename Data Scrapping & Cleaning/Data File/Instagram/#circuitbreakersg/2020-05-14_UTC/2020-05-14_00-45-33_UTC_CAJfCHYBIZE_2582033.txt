This Peanut satay sauce is a dead easy way to quickly add a ton of flavour to salads, stir frys, or noodles apart from satay alone . It stays in the fridge for weeks or months …not that it matters as you will use this up in no time.
However , you need to add a distinctive flavour if you will be serving GADO GADO using the Satay Sauce .. My secret recipe in now revealed ! - from the Brand Norasate back then (1986 - 2012 ) 
So yeah - get the recipe !
