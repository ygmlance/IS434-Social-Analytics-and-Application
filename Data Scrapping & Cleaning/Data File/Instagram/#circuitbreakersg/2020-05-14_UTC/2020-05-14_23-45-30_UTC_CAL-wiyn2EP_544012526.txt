Do you like Cream Puff?
.
Cream Puff is a filled French choux pastry ball with a typically sweet and moist filling of whipped cream, custard, pastry cream, or ice cream. It is my favourite pastry. The cream exploding out of the puff is an amazing experience. .
Featuring the cream puff by @baristartcoffee_sg Wow it was a huge puff. It is like the size of my palm. Aww I want to sink my teeth into the soft creamy puff. The cream is so smooth and creamy of course haha. I like the texture of the puff. The light crispy top with the soft creamy inside is simply perfect. @myprincetravis loves it a lot too and ask me to buy more next time. Haha. Comfort food is important for us especially this difficult period. Jia you Everyone! 💪
