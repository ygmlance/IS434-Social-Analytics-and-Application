#stayhomefun - playing with #Squigz .

Thought this was worth a post because #goodthingsmustshare .

Yesterday I took out our box of Squigz, which I bought 2 years ago. Somehow the kids have not picked it out from the toy shelves for months. I randomly googled "ways to play squigz" and got really excited about the endless possibilities with this toy .

Here are some of the ways we played with this toy over the past 1.5days . 
1) sticking and pulling from vertical surfaces . 
2) a race/ shuttle run to collect the pieces from the vertical surface and sticking them on a plastic box (look at the video to see how this game can be modified for children of different ages and abilities - yz stuck his pieces much higher and jumped to pull them out) .
3) creating patterns .
4) pretend play (in this video, my kids were farmers harvesting their crops. Before this, they planted and 'watered' their plants) . 
5) small world play with animal figurines .
6) Making a track/path for toy vehicles .
7) Learning about symmetry .
8) Squigz and rubberband - like a geoboard (making shapes, numbers, letters and any diagram) .
9) Using squigz and rubberband to create a pompom maze/ pom pom drop .

I really enjoyed playing this toy with my kids. Hehe .
