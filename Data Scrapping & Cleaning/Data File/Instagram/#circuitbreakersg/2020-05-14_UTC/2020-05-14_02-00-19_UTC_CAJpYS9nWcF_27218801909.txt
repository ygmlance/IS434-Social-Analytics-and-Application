In light of latest Covid-19 measures, Tekka Place is taking extra precautions and doing our best to adhere to the latest safety guidelines provided by our government. 
There will only be ONE entrance and ONE exit point to our mall now.

Please enter Tekka Place through our main entrance at Serangoon Road (near Yakun Kaya Toast & Starbucks) and exit at Clive Street (near link bridge to Annex Block). Together, we can overcome this! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª #tekkaplace #tekkaplacesingapore #littleindia #rochor #jalanbesar #bugis #shoppingmall #singapore #exploresingapore #visitsingapore #circuitbreakersg #workfromhome #stayhome #heightenedmeasures #togetherwecanovercome #sgunited
