Where will be your post-COVID destination be?
I know we are still in the circuit breaker and the world is in a limbo but it never hurts to dream a little, have some happy thoughts and plan a list of things you want to do when this is all over.
My choice is obvious. I look forward to the next adventure, first with my family.
Take care and stay safe!
