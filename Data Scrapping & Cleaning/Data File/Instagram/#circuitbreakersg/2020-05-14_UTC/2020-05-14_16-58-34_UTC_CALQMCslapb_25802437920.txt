IT’S DAMN GOOD WHAT.

Out of curiosity, I sliced the bread, and trimmed off the uneven top. It’s actually pretty delicious. I’ve been experimenting this recipe for at least 4 times now, gotta thank my parents (esp mum) for being the guinea pig.

Been experimenting the right amounts of toppings (this has flaxseed, millet, red quinoa; I left out the pumpkin and sunflower seeds because too much toppings were too tiring to eat). Also adjusted the amount of bread improver this time round. 3g, instead of 4g. So it’s not as soft to the point of falling apart, but still a good bread texture.

I mean even the top scrap tastes like those fancy bread rolls that restaurants serve, if I dare say so myself.

Guess the only things remaining are to figure if I should still try to pullman this thing, and baking times. Despite 40~ mins of baking in the pullman tin, the sides are always undercooked, and I need to remove from the pan, flop it onto a bakeware dish to get the sides thoroughly baked through. So I suspect it’s the high hydration %? Hmm.

The quest for multigrain bread continues.
