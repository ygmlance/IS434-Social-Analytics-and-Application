Today marks the parents' 50th year wedding anniversary. Cannot imagine that my mum wed my dad at age of 21 and bore their 1st child at age of 24. My dad is 11yrs older but even though this was an arranged marriage, their love blossomed at 1st sight and has grown over the years. 
I'm thankful to God for placing me into this family and I'm happy to be their child too! Right @dylanchua001 and @catx_trophe #remembering #circuitbreakersg day 38 ends :)1
