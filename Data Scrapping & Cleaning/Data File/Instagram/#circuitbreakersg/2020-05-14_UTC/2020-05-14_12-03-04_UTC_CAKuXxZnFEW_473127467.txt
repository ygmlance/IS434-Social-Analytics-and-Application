14 MAY 2020 | Circuit Breaker Day 38

Day 38 - #circuitbreakersg
☂️
It has been awhile since I took the bus home as Hubby tries to send me to/fro work during circuit breaker period to minimize the time I am outside.
😘
Fewer vehicles on the road that was once busy... storm is brewing at the backdrop but thankfully I got to the shelter on time 🚍
When will we resume back to normal? Guess this may have to be our new norm for quite some time. Meanwhile, be well and safe.
🙌
