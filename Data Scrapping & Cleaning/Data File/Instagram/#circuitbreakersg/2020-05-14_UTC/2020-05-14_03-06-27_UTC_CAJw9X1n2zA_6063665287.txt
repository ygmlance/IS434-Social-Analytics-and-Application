Wed night we had a first CIRCUIT BREAKER PRAYER MEETING of May and over 25 showed up and worshipped and prayed for an hour and a half. For 40 mins we were in "breakout rooms" of smaller groups, sharing and praying national, church and personal needs. (Photo:Sarah) #circuitbreakersg #prayermeeting #coronaviruspandemic #wrpf_sg
