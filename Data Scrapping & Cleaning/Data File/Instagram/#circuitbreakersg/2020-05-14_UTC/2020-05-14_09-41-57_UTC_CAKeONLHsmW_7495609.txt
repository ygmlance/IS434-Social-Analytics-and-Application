TroubleMakerTeos Hair Salon even provide colour dying services for their customers ðŸ˜‚

This was fun for the older kids cos they only got to know how crazy the paint will look like after they finished their job - blowing of the paint from their straws. While we tried to let #jeromedrondronteo Didi blow the straw, he wasnâ€™t able to make such effect, so I let him painted his customerâ€™s hair instead. Everyone has a good laugh on how their pictures turned out. ðŸ’•ðŸ’ˆ
