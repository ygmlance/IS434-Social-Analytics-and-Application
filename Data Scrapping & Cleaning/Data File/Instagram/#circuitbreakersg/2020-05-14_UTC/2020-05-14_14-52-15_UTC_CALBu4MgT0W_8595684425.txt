Given the current "Circuit Breaker" measures in Singapore, I wonder how many of these offices are currently occupied with people working in them.

This pandemic has certainly transformed the world into one where "working-from-home" is becoming a norm - even for the most conservative companies.

How are you adapting to this home-working situation? Did you have to buy stuff so you can work comfortably at home?
