Joining me to keep fit is also my boy.. He joined @vivokidssingapore #vivokids #vivokidssingapore recently, only attended 1 class and #circuitbreakersg happened.. So, I'm getting him to follow the class (which was supposed to be Monday!)
And it wasnt too bad...
He tried to follow the lines:
1. Forward
2. Sideways
3. Backwards
4. Balancing soft toy on head
And usually we throw it in a box but I didn't give him a target.
Oh well... Well done boy!
