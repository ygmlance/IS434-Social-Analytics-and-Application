MY FAV Pandan sweetmeat. Kanom Krok Bai Toey. Had this in Bangkok and I fell in love with it ever since. Itâ€™s a type of Kueh and it is usually seen in flower shape in Bkk. It is so fragrant and it is chewier when less cooked. Best to eat it hot. 
RECIPE:
All purpose flour 130g
Tapioca flour 65g
Baking powder 1 teaspoon
Sugar 85g
A pinch of salt
1 egg
Coconut milk 125ml
coconut pandan juice 240ml (15 pandan leaves + water 250ml, blend and strain) 
Vegetable oil 1 tablespoon

You can cook whatever shape you wantðŸ¤£ easier to form shapes if you use drizzle bottle or even better if you have the flower mould or takoyaki pan.
