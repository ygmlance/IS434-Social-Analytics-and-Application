One thing I learn after 38 days of circuit breaker, is Perspective.

“Being productive” as a form of distraction from the doom & gloom is all good but please dont punish yourself by feeling inadequate just because someone posted on social media about their “fruitful” day while yours was lacklustre because of a case of cabin fever or uncooperative “co-habitants”.

This is not a competition

It is okay if you didn’t master a new recipe, failed to complete your zoom workouts, have piled up dishes in the sink, tired eyes from having more video conferences in a week than you ever had your whole life..

and for those with kids, I salute you!
Just because there are days where you are convinced your children are demon spawns and you wanna disowned them, it doesn’t make you are a bad parent.
Just a frustrated one haha.
(Frankly I’m glad the closest I am to children are those on my tv screen atm)
.
Everyone is going through this the very first time in their life. Considering the complete lack of experience, I’d say as long as there’s effort on your part, regardless of results, it is already commendable!
