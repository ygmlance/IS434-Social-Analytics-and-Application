Breakfast today, was yet another attempt at Chye Poh Kway Teow, or Fried Flat Rice Noodles with Preserved Turnip. For todayâ€™s version, i used both sweet and salty preserved turnip, and sweated it together with the garlic in lard, before throwing in the noodles, and other ingredients. The flavour was good, but i still need to work on the wok-hei to give the noodles its signature smokiness. Tasty and satisfying! ðŸ˜‹ #chyepohkwayteow #teochewfood #teochewcuisine  #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookedbreakfast #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
