Bruine Bonen or Brenebon Soup. Indonesian Kidney Bean Soup. •
This dish is originated from Manado, Indonesia. It is a dish influenced by the Dutch and usually cooked using pork or beef. I am using pork rib and potatoes for this version. This stew is very fragrant with seasoning such as nutmeg, cloves, scallion, garlic, shallots, lime leaves, lemongrass, Nor forgetting salt, pepper and a little sugar. Husband approved ✔️
