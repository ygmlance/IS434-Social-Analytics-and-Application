#7dayhomeworkoutchallenge with #heatherrobertsoncom 
Heather Robertson's workout today was Cardio and Abs. It was just 1 circuit on repeat. Also did #chloetingchallenge 3 weeks lean arms challenge. I'm always struggling to keep those arms up! 
Sorry that's my hair in action.. I'm not sure if I should grow it or cut it short still.. And also, I'm in a Marie Kondo mode. I'm going to continue to clear all my stuff by end week. I hope to finish it then focus on work. Wish me luck!
