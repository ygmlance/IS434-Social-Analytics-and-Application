🕢Dinner: Bánh Mì

And my kitchen for Vietnamese menu continues...Monday dinner fixed and settled.

Besides Pho and Summer Roll, Banh Mi is also one of the Vietnamese popular street foods.
The main bomb for this Vietnamese sandwich is its delicious spread, Pate Gan Ga, aka chicken liver pate.

Made my own chicken liver pate with fresh herbs and spices, and then pass the mixture through a fine sieve to give it a silky, smooth consistency.
My version of this Vietnamese sandwich is made up with crusty homemade baguette, chicken liver pate, ham, pan seared lemongrass beef slice, homemade pickled radish and carrots, coriander/cilantro, mint leaf and drizzle of seasonings.

These sandwiches had definitely made my tum tum happy.
The above are the must-have fillings in my ideal perfect banh mi. so, what about yours?

let’s Jiak!
