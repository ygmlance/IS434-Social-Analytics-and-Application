My Moringa tree! Cultivated it from a shoot from my brother-in-law, and since has been growing strong and too tall! Drying the leaves to grind into Moringa Leaf Powder, which you can add into drinks and soup. And drying off the pods to get the seeds that you can consume directly. We use some of the fresh leaves in our daily diet too, such as omelette and soup. #organic #moringa #natural #growyourown #growyourownveggies #growyourownmedicine #circuitbreakersg #singaporeðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬
