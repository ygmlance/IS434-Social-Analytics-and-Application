Day 36. Saw more vehicles on the road as we looked out from home. With the number of local cases remaining at a single digit, the circuit breaker seems to be effective. The mid-day sky was beautiful. My folks at home were craving for some food items from Ding Tai Feng. So for dinner, I cooked fried rice with pork chop (猪排炒饭), scallion pan cake (葱油饼) and wantan in chilli oil (红油抄手). The sizzling sound when the hot oil was poured into the chilli paste, was music to our ears. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #homecookedmeal #instadaily
