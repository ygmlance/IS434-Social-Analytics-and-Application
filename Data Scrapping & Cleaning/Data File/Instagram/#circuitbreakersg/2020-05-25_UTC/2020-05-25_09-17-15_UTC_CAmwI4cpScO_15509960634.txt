Hey Singapore! Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri and congratulations to the last week of circuit breaker! 7️⃣
.
As we march into Phase 1 and begin a new normal, protection and caution become increasingly important in our daily lives. In Phase 1, we are allowed to have 2 visitors from the same household. So take this chance to deliver some love to your family!
.
Our disinfectants come in the form of:
- Sanitizing sprays (for use on hand, face and even masks)
- Concentrates (add some to your diffusers or humidifiers)
- Cleaning solutions (mix with water and wipe common areas)
.
Protect yourself and stop the virus before it stops you.
