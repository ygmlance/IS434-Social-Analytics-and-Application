Build something out of your cardboard boxes, it’ll be fun they say. 📦📦 Now meet @paulgohrj who refuses to get into the box unless I put an iPad on it. 😶😳 Haha, the bright side is @collingoh and I had fun doing it together and doing it for Paul. In case you can’t tell, it’s a cardboard airplane which we name Rascal Airline. ✈️ @rascalandfriends 🙊

Very befitting of the current Paul. Gone is my smiley baby and in his place, is a little boy who is very cheeky, has little patience and recently learn how to frown. Scroll to the back for his signature frown. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I hope it doesn’t last long. (In case you read this one day, we love you very much nonetheless. And you are still so sweet, and rough, to me. ILYVVM. ♥️) #paulgohrj #2yearsold #rascalandfriendssg #rascalantics #rascalandfriends #nonasties #toocutetocover #rascalbum #rascalmumsg #cardbox #cardboxplay #cardboxplane #stayhome #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
