Dinner. #gyudon 
Went to nearby #shengsiong  thinking of seafood for dinner but this slightly smaller one only had a small selection and all the clams were out. 
Bought a #flanksteak since I was already there. Not the best meat but adequate for sliced steak on rice. 
Too lazy to start the #sousvide just to make 2 #onsenegg so I tried the cheat method of the eggs in boiled water. Not very successful. Whites were under and yolks were over. 
Complemented the dinner with crispy #garlic , and some #japanesepickles and #furikake  bought from #donki
