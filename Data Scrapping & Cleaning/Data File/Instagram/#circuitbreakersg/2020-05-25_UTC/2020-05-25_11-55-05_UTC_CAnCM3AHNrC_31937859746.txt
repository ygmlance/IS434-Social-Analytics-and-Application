We made vegetarian sushi today! And now i really understand why we have to pay more for good sushi. Lots of hardwork put just on the rice- rinsing and washing many times before we can cooked it.

We made a sushi platter - inari sushi, egg and prawn mayo sushi, mini onigiri, other sushi fillings include cucumber,carrots,avocado, pickled daikon. Yumsss!

The recipe we used for the sushi rice and the rice really turned out super good! https://www.justonecookbook.com/sushi-rice/
