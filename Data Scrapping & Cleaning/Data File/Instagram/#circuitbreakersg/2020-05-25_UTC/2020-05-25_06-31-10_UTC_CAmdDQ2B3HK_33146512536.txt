Ok I probably killed myself doing this choreo by @poca_pocaxie and I'm still not nailing the timing BUT it is a super nice choreography.
.

Thanks to @lukkoutz for the push to do this too. LOL. I was just enjoying watching Poca dance that night during her iglive. ðŸ˜… Didn't expect I'll end up sweating for 2.5hours today... ðŸ˜“ BUT AT LEAST I TRIED; and proud to complete this choreo. âœŒ
