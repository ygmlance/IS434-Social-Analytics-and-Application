Mask Batik Blue (SGD $12.90) @ SupaSew.
.
From a small batch producer of hand made, sewn cloth masks. These artisanal masks are fashionable, vibrant, and elegant, with the option to incorporate additional disposable filters.
.
This features a dual-layer blue batik print on cloth, with string straps that loop comfortably around the ears.
.
The hand sewn mask fits snugly over the nose and mouth, yet its pyramid shape allows for easy breathing. An elegant and fashionable piece that pays homage to the national airline.
