Thanks for voting which of my home bakes to post first. So the winner is matcha soufflé pancakes! 🥞
✨
Made using organic matcha powder, the matcha taste is quite distinct though I’ll prefer it to be more robust and earthy. Nonetheless it’s still decent and always love Japanese souffle pancakes for the fluffiness! Paired with a cup of hot matcha using yuki matcha from @hvala_sg! 🍵
