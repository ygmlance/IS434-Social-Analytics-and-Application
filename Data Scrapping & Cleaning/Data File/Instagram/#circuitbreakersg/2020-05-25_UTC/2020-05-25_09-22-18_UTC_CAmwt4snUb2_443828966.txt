Circuit breaker requires us to physically distance. Human nature compels us to socially connect. Covid-19 has shaken up the way we bond, and forced us to find new norms during these unsettling times.

How do you tell a kid to stay home everyday, distance himself / herself from friends, avoid hugs and kisses and all forms of physical affection.

My 7 year-old niece who is an only child started to FaceTime us regularly since the start of her school holidays. We knew she needed a little project to focus on.

Being the little baker and social butterfly, we had asked her to organise a ‘Zoom tea-party’ with some of her friends and cousins. She would need to make the invitation cards, send them to her guests, rsvp, bake for the party, prepare some games, and arrange delivery of her party kits.

She did an amazing job (with the help of her parents of course, and a little from her ‘Bing Bing 姑姑”), we had a lovely afternoon over Zoom. I appreciate the time spent with little kids - they are so pure, so encouraging and their laughter so infectious and sweet. Everyone unanimously ‘signed up’ for the next Zoom Party. I am thinking of a thematic party with some ‘to-do’ prep for the young guests.

Like I have shared many a time over the last weeks, covid-19 has hurled many curveballs in every aspect of our lives, but we must continue to catch and return them with zeal and positivity - to come up on the better side at the end of this. .
