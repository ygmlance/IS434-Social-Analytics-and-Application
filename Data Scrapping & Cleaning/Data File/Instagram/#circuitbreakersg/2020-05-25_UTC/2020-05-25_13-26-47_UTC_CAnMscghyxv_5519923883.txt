It was a feast for the eyes and belly when all of my favourite creamy bafun uni, Negi toro, marinated egg yolk, caviar with gold flakes rolled onto a special Taro-taku, alongside the omega Bakudan don 2.0 with even more bafun uni, fresh wild-caught blue fin ootoro with homemade shoyu ikura laid out on a bed of sushi gohan and the mega triple tuna maki of ootoro, chutoro and akami.

 Possibly the most indulgent meal we had this Circuit Breaker and a Mother’s day treat that remains unforgettable both on the palette and in my memories 🥰😋🍣🍶
