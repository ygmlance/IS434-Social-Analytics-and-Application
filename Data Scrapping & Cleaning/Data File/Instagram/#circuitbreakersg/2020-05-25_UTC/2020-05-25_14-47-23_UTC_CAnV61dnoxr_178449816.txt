Day 49 of #CircuitBreakerSG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cheat day! Hahha who am I kidding, somehow or other everyday is cheat day. Aside from Nasi Lemak, this Wanton Mee is the other thing I have been tarpowing back the most during Circuit Breaker.
.
I dunno why but itâ€™s prob too difficult to replicate this dish this way at home. I dunno how to cook the noodles this QQ. I donâ€™t know how to make char siew and wanton. I suppose I could learn but all 3 things Iâ€™ve never done before.  Mountain too high to climb ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Happy to eat lunch at 12.30 instead of 2.30 like for the past few days!
.
And to think this only costs $3.50 before my additional top up of wantons. Hats off to our hawkers who have been working hard during this period as well as in the past!
