♣︎ Breakfast idea ♣︎ Sautéed mushroom with toast

It’s very easy to make sautéed mushroom and can later on be used in different dishes, e.g. sandwich, pizza, pasta, etc.

All you need is brown button mushroom, cut into slices, fry in olive oil and butter until dry, season with salt, black pepper and herbs. Mix with minced onion if you like but it is optional.

Serve it with mozzarella cheese and lettuce. It’s a simple yet tasty breakfast to fuel up the day!
