Day 49/56•Stayhome Dinner 
The Braised Works! My mum cooked braise-abit-of-everything & gave us a portion of everything 😅 
There were pheonix claws, wings. pork belly, eggs, taupok, shrooms & taukee. 
It was really yummy & made my Monday felt so much lighter...all I needed to do 👉 Blanch a plate of caixin & cook the rice! 😍
