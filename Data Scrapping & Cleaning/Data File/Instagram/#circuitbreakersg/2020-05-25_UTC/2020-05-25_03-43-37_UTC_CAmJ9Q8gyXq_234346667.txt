【Recipe】Warm apple cherry crisp topped with cold mascarpone cheese. The perfect way to start the morning. #honeybeeweekendbreakfast 
Semi-soft, juicy, tangy sweet fruits topped with nutty, toasty crisp made with wholesome Abend bread crumbs from @swissbakesg . A rather successful combination and pretty delicious I must say. 
You can of course opted for other bread or use flour even for the crisps.  But using a wholesome bread packed with nuts and seeds, Low carb and high protein just makes it even better. 
This recipe is really quite versatile. I pretty much eyeballed the whole thing. You can switch the fruits to berries. Add more bread crumbs topping, remove the sugar or even try savoury version with ham and cheese 😂 #theskyisthelimit
