Day 49: We have survived the 7th week of Circuit Breaker 😃. I have launched new side business for myself to survive through this difficult time. I was making quite a lot of fabric mask during these 2 months, and I decided to start making some for sales. 
1 more weeks to go😄😄, but unfortunately my makeup courses still cannot start! I will pray hard for the best to come!
