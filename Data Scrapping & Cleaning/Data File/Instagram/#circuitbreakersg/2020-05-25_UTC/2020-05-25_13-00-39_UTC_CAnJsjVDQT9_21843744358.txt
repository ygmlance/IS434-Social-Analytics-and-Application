#DurianLovers alert: the price of your favourite fruit could drop drastically in this midst of COVID-19 pandemic! 😝🥰 Yes, the #CircuitBreaker would've dampened the mood for some of you, but we are sure that a cozy, wallet-friendly durians feast at home would cheer up your mood!🏡😋 Other than being extremely tasty, this king of the fruits is actually one of the most nutritious fruits! 🤩 It is power-packed with the following health benefits: 💛 Boost your immunity, which is crucial when we are in the midst of the pandemic
💛 Full of healthy (monounsaturated) fats which can lower your cholesterol level
💛 Prevents heart disease and stroke
💛 Makes one happier and fall asleep easier
💛 Promotes digestion

Don't go all out and indulge though, as it has a high calorie content and it is considered to be "heaty". The key is to eat it with moderation. And alcohols are also off-limits when you are eating durians. 🚫🍷 P.S. we have tagged a few of the durian stalls offering deliveries to your homes. 🚙🚲 Tag ALL your durian lover friends in the comments below to let them know, and get ready to start feastin'! 😉❤ #safefnbsg #savelocal #supportfnbsg
