In a burger coma....😋🍔😴 Burger for dinner last night, and again for lunch today☺️. .
.
I’ve been meaning to make these soft sourdough potato buns for some time (recipe credit @maurizio ) and finally did. So good! The right bite, complex but not tangy, with a buttery fragrance .  What a difference a good bun makes! 
Threw in a ‘shack sauce’ while I was at it. 
Maybe a run later... post 😴 .
