"We are struggling to build with what we have" 
That came as a surprise as Daddy is the best lego builder in our home. It seemed that we had made a mistake to open up 3 junior lego sets with various duplos lying around. Parts seemed to disappear (not sure if it ended up in the vacumn though we tried our best to check thoroughly) ðŸ¤£ 
Then I said "Let's clean up and sort". But it kinda terrorized people. Cos I can be a hoarder but I cannot stand messiness. When I want to clean up/ declutter, it meant business and I simply dislike to hear "Leave it there first". Just like problems won't go away on their own, messiness wouldn't get organized unless you do something about it right? Anyway, it is the best time to do it during circuit breaker since cant head out to anywhere also ðŸ¤£ Trust me  its time consuming but you get pure satisfaction after that ðŸ˜‰

Anyway we manage to gather 98% of the parts and here we have our Toy Story 4 Food Truck!
