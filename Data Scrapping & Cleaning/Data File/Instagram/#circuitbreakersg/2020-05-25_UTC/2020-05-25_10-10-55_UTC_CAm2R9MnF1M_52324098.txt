Not Sunday but just as good a time for a one pot roast.
.
My Roast Chicken:
1 whole chicken butterflied 
4 Russets, rough cut
2 Carrots, rough cut
1 whole Garlic, chopped 
1 punnet of Cherry Tomatoes
1 tbsp Balsamic Vinegar
1 whole onions, diced
Mushrooms sliced
1 cup Olive Oil for different components
Preferred seasonings (read below)
.
Method for chicken: 
In a ziplock bag, add 1/2 of the OO + any chicken seasoning - or just S&P & Rosemary.  I’m using #webersaltfreeseasoning + 2 tbsp of #kwongwohhing Premium Light Soya which will give my Roast a bit more colour. Add chicken, mix thoroughly and leave to marinate for at least an hour, longer is better.
.
Method for Veggies:
1/4 cup oil + garlic, S&P & veggies - Toss everything together and add to one side of roasting pan making sure your butterflied chicken will fit fully extended.
.
Put Chicken & Veggies into a 240°C oven for 30mins.
.
Method for Mushrooms:
To hot pan, add 2 tbsp of OO, onions & fry to softened. Add mushrooms + add Jalapeño Salt or just regular S&P, fry till half soften and set aside .
.
Method for Tomatoes:
2 tbsp of OO, Balsamic Vinegar, S&P. Set aside. .
At the end of the 30mins Chicken Roast, add the marinated Tomatoes and the par-cooked Mushrooms and return to oven for 15mins.
.
Check if chicken is cook and potatoes are golden brown. Tomatoes should split a little and mushrooms fully cooked. Ready to serve.
