I have been wanting to post this the whole day!! I don't usually make whole cakes with decorations (mostly because my friends just want to eat the cake and not the decorations 😆), but I made a cheesecake cus I had frozen oatmeal cookies and an expiring sour cream. Opted for the heartshaped pan since I have it and am so glad I didn't end up with an overflowing tin!

So I baked the cheesecake on the same day I made the 2 earl grey chiffons. I only have one chiffon tin by the way. So even though I have 2 sets of ingredients I still gotta wait for the 1st cake to be unmoulded before making the next one. Inefficiency at its best. 😂 Was so tired that I didn't realise I didn't give my cheesecake a water bath at the 30th minute mark!! I also do not rmb how long it needs to be baked for. 😅 I usually gauge by the state of the cake (centre being jiggly, sides being firm). But thank fully the cake turned out fine!! I think it was baked for 35 minutes at 170d.c. Who else loves the browned edges?! Because I do!🙋🏻‍♀️ Cut up the orange and grapes the same way I used to do in the kitchen when making fruit tarts and it was a blissful moment. Simple task but so much fun. Couldn't do much with just 2 fruits and remembered I have leftover macarons! Such useful dessert for decorations. Added some blueberries for a pop of contrast and ta-dah! Glad I did this in the day time when there was natural light for a quick photo. 
Thank you le husband for helping me wash the mountainful of dishes after all the baking I did. 💕
