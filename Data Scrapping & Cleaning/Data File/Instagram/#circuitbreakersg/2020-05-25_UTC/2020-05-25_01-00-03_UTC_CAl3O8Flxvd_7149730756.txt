“When I first graduated from fashion school in 2016, it was very tough finding a job. The local fashion industry is small, and the number of jobs were few. Back then, it took me months to find a job, but the current graduates have it much worse than I did. The measures against COVID-19 has severely affected retail businesses, reducing job availability for graduates seeking opportunities in the retail industry. I empathise deeply with the anxiety and worries of students graduating in such an economic situation. ⠀
⠀
As the founder of @minormiracles.shop I am in a position to help others, and this has spurred me to employ fashion graduates who were unable to find jobs during this climate. By using leftovers from our signature colourful fabrics, they used their sewing skills to make masks to help society. All profits were donated to various charities for migrant workers and community services. To date, the team of 11 fresh graduates have raised $4,800 worth of COVID-19 funds through their production of masks.⠀
⠀
I’m not the only local label who has reached out to help others. There are many brands doing the same during this period. I’ve noticed a stark difference before and during the circuit breaker. Due to the long hours or stress we’ve faced in school or work, we only had the capacity to be concerned with our own personal problems. However, I am heartened to see how we are starting to care for each other more than before.⠀
⠀
I hope we don't fall back into our old routines of focusing only on ourselves when everything is over. Let’s continue to extend our help to those in need, during and after COVID-19.⠀
⠀
I choose to power compassion.”⠀
