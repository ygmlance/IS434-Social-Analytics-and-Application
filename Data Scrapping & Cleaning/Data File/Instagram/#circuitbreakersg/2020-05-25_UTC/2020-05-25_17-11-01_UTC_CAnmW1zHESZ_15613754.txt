Poh's Duck Rendang with Coconut Pandan Lace Crepe and Chilled Pickle. (winning dish to last week immunity challenge) I think the Pandan green was a deliberate overdose! On pandan & coconut craze now. Second try with Poh's recipe and I'm convinced she is a great cook! probably the first time I have cooked a dish myself and I was raving nonstop while eating. #circuitbreakersg day33 #mylollybellykitchen #ibonappetit #quarantinecuisine #masterchefau #pohlingyeow #isolationcooking
