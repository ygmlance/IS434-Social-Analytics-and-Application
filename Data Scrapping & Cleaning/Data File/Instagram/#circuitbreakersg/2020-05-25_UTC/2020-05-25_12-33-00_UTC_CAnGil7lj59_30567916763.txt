#circuitbreakersg day 49

I have never been good at art. Not in school, not now. But I can cook, a little, I guess.
.

So here’s my humble attempt of creating some “art” with my focaccia. 🙂
.
.
.
The end result wasn’t quite what I had expected as the ingredients on the focaccia didn’t survive very well with the high heat needed to bake the bread. I will need to work on this in my next attempt. .
.
.
Good thing is that the bread is tasty (far better than the first time I made focaccia using a different recipe)! So I ended up only having the focaccia for dinner because who can resist freshly baked bread!? 😛

I’m thankful that it’s a non-working day today and I got to experiment with something fun in the kitchen. And we are down to the last week of circuit breaker! 💪🏻 #gratitudediary

Btw, let me know if you could tell what the picture is! 😃
