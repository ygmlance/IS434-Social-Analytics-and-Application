TWENTY FIFTH MAY TWENTY TWENTY | HBD to the one and only Man of the house ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. We are still in #CircuitBreakerSG but I still got you a cake to celebrate your day! Amidst all these craziness, thankful for everyone just being Alive!!! And without fail, something sure to happen on your birthday - this year is Gisselle running a temperature but lucky thing we are all home. Hope you still enjoy your TamPoPo ramen takeaway as your yearly must-have. â€¢
