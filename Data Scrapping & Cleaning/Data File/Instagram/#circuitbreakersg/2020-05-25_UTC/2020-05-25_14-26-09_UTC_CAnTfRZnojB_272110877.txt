Day 47. We decided to have slack day. Slow and steady pace. Binge-watching of movies/drama series. Tea - made another batch of taro mochi dorayaki. This time the structure is so beautiful. The work of the baking powder. Dinner - A simple meat sauce with okra drizzled in ponzu sauce. Tomorrow, business back as usual. #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #skyisapalette #skyporn #realfood #dorayaki #homecookedmeal #homemade #instadaily
