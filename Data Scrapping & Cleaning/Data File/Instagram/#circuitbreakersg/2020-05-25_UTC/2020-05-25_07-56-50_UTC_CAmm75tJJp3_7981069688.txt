Louis Armstrong & His All-Stars - Live in 1956 (Allentown, PA), 2019. So this was a ‘lost’ tape that was uncovered on eBay and released on Record Store Day 2019. By the 1950s Armstrong had disbanded his big band and was touring with handpicked all-stars. On this record he sings, scats and plays the trumpet. Full of hits from the day. And his version of You’ll Never Walk Alone should see #liverpoolfans rush for this piece of history.  #louisarmstrong #livein1956 #velmamiddleton #orgmusic #originalmasterrecording
