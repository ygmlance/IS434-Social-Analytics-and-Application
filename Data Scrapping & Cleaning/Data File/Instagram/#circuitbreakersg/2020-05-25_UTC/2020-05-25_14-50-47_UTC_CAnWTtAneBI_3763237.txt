Notes: You can also cook this beef stew using a cast iron pot like Le Creuset. Instead of slow cooking it, lower the heat after you add back the beef to the pot, cover lid and cook for 3-4hours (Stirring every 30mins or so) At the last hour, remove lid and cook until liquid has reduced and the gravy would have thicken up a little. ‚Å£‚Å£
