This year is an unusual Hari Raya Puasa due to Covid-19. We are encouraged to stay at home and only to go out unless necessary. Even if we really need to go out, we have to be alone. ⁣

I recalled in the past years, we will visit our Malay friends and green packet are distributed to the kids. Nevertheless, we can still keep in touch via video call and keep the spirits up. ⁣

Thanks to my Muslim neighbours for sharing their home cooked food at our doorstep to share the joy. ⁣

Although there are no family gathering during these period but we can do our part to ensure the communities are safe. ⁣Sometimes, the real superheroes are the one right in front of us!

Please take care more than ever everyone amid the continuing pandemic. Because together we can fight the outbreak!⁣

Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri 🎆
