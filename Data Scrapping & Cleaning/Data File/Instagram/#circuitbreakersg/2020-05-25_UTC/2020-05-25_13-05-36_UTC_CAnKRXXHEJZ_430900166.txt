Most days you’ll find us somewhere between these 2 photos! 😜 "The Happy Babes Club” & the “Oh Dear What’s Going On Next” dilemma. But you know us, we’d rather be chio than boring! We haven’t seen our gals looking so studious in a long while ... must be all the courses we’re attending! Glad to be in the company of fellow "students" who are making the most of their time & energy while upgrading and/or learning a new skill. What are you up to this week? More government announcements coming up soon... more navigation ahead... best be prepared to start steering again... in nice WFH outfits from B&M of course! 😜🤓
