Day 49 Circuit Breaker Dinner. Left with a pre-packed ingredients for White Radish Soup from Meidi-ya the other day. But I still love my ikan bilis and ginger soup base... So I cooked the whole pack in my own base. Glad that the lovely ðŸ˜‡ didn't mind having soup with me cos the pack is good for 2 pax! And we had #natto as side dish!
