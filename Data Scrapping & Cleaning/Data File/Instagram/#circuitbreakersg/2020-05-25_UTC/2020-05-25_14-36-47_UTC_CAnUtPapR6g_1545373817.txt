Black Sesame Paste with Homemade Glutinous Rice Balls. 
To make the rice balls: - Add water slowly to 50g of Glutinous Rice Flour n knead to form the dough. Use the dough to make around 7 rice balls.
- Put the glutinous rice balls into a pot of boiling water. It’s ready when they start to float to the surface. 
The rice ball is chewy. I will probably try making rice balls with black sesame and peanut fillings next time. 
For the paste, I had used Hollyfarm’s Instant Sesame Paste.
