Having snagged a box from The Whisking Well’s Mother’s Day special earlier this month, I was excited to give them a try and of course the occasion was merely an excuse to indulge in more sweets. Eyeing their exclusive Rose Burnt Cheesecake, I was initially drawn to the 'pretty in pink' slice. Softest of the trio, it had a very luxe and creamy texture. Limited to the particular bake sale, the cake’s gentle hint of floral was distinct but not too out of place with the savouriness of the cheese-rich layer. The flavours from the Matcha Burnt Cheesecake on the other hand, did not meld together as well in my opinion; being the bitterness of the tea and the saltish tang of the cheese. Hence, if I was to pick, the OG Burnt Cheesecake would be my favourite of the three. The burnt taste was most prominent with the original flavour and had a balanced profile.

Next, the Lemon Raspberry Loaf Cake served as a sort of palate cleanser for me. Fresh lemons and raspberry jam made from scratch with no sugar added, the slice was moist and refreshing. The icing was thankfully not overwhelmingly sweet and unlike some others that I have tried, the layer wasn’t thick. The dark horse (pun intended), however, was the Black Cocoa Brownie which was fudgy, rich, and not overly dense. A quick pop into the microwave made it even better. The chunks of walnuts found in the bake also helped cut a tinge of the heaviness and added nice bits of crunch. And a close second was the soft Belgium Chocolate Crinkle Cookies. A chocolate lover’s dream come true, they were decadent, tender, and moreish.
