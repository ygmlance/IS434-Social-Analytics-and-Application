Say hi to my (huge) luncheon meat buns! Saw @joellebaked â€˜s #circuitbakingchallenge IG story this morning and the theme was loko local. This weekâ€™s theme fits perfectly with the luncheon meat buns I planned to make today.  So I participated in the challenge... 5 weeks late ðŸ˜‚ .
I finally managed to get soft and fluffy buns today! Small wins hehe. Just need to work on the proportion of dough vs luncheon meat the next time because my buns turned out huge. Yay hehe so happy!!
