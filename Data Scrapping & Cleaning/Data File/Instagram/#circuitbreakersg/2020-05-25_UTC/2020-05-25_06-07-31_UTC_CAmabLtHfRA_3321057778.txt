My new skill.

After spending a week listening to lectures, answering questions, nearly two hours of study yesterday and a 40 minute exam today, I have gained a huge amount of knowledge and understanding of Covid-19, and the work of epidemiologists.

My respect has grown for people working around the world to contact, trace, explain, and support those who have contracted this virus, as well as help those who have to quarantine.

There is a limited window that contact tracers have to identify, isolate and quarantine cases and contacts in order to keep the RO at 1 or below.

We owe it these individuals, as much as to the others on the front line, to be respectful, and above all think of others not ourselves.
