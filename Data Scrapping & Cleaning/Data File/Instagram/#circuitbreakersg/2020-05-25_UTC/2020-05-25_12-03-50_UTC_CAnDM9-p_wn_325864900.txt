On Friday 22 May, our #ElementarySchool community came out (virtually!) in force to support @itsrainingraincoats, a charity which supports foreign workers in #Singapore.

During their online learning, students could be seen donning their PJs and fancy dress costumes - some even sported some crazy hair styles. It was a great event where students had an opportunity to have some fun, while also learning about and supporting other people in our #community.

A huge thank you to everyone who donated to this event - the amount raised will be used to help support the situation in Singapore for our #foreignworkers living in dormitories. Thank you to the caring #SJII community for your generous donations!
