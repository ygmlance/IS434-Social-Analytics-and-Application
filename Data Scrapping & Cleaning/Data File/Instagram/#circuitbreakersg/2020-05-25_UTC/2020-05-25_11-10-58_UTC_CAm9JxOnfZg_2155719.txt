This afternoon I have baked this sedap Kuih Bingka Ubi (baked tapioca cake). This round I have used Chef Damian D’ Silva recipe. I must say it’s lots of work compared to other recipe that I used. BUT it’s all worth it! 
This traditional kuih is so aromatic from the pandan leaves, eggs and coconut milk. The crispy crust and semi soft texture makes you smitten with the taste. My family simply loves it. 
The recipe is worth to keep!
