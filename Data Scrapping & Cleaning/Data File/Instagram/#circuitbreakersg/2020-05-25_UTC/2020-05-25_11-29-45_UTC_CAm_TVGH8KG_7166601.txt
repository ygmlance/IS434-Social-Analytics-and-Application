Behind the scenes of FLAT (Part II)
A film.
143 mins 
Year 2020. 
Strange times. 
Time of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A circuit breaker.
We are staying home. 
Some viewers were curious how FLAT was filmed. Was I with a crew? How can? It is the circuit breaker. No one should visit each other during the pandemic. 
Nope, I didn't break any rules. There was no crew in my house, not even the director Lei Yuan Bin who initiated the idea. 
I filmed myself alone using just my iPhone 8 plus, phone stands and improvised tripod, with director Lei giving instructions and suggestions on Facebook messenger. We didn't even voice call. ðŸ˜… 
We were exploring new ways of working, with the simplest means!

Here are some BTS/after shoot shots: 
1. Doraemon after being washed, bathroom. His nose and bell had actually dropped off.
Yet to be fixed. 
2. Doraemon being dried, living room.
3. Tape markings on the floor to recall where to position camera, bedroom: one for bedroom view and one for view of bathroom and watch TV scene.
4. Tape markings, living room: for view of working at table.
5. Tape markings near entrance of kitchen: for view of doing laundry in the kitchen.
6. Tape markings, kitchen: for cooking scenes.
7. Tape markings, living room: for outside window scene.
8. Tape marking, bedroom: for wide bedroom scene showing shelves and bed.
9. Set up for hair-cutting scene,  bathroom.
10. List of activities to do during the final 2 days of shoot given by the director. Washing toilet was later replaced by giving Doraemon a massage bath.

It helped that I have an extra android phone to document these. ðŸ˜‰
