#circuitbreakersg : 💓 US 💓

Staying home can’t get better than today. Sometimes it’s okay to hold back, analyse the Situation, rejuvenate the surrounded energy and come back with Bang. Today’s been such a day for us took this PH very seriously after a long time tried to calm my mind and took some rest in the noon after the delicious comforting home cooked meal, in the evening did some house chores with the help of my hubz 🤪 then watched a movie(🎥 PASSENGER though it’s a second time watching after the first one in theatre) after a month or two can’t remember with roasted russet potato as a snack. Been a relaxed evening prepping the mind and body for the upcoming storm of work days 🤣.
