#circuitbreakertip 6: BAKE TO CLEAR
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Hands up, all you circuit bakers! 🙋🏻🙋🏽 Households often have overripe bananas (kudos to those who have made banana breads to clear them), but do you know what is the topmost wasted food in households?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🍞 BREAD - Bread ranks first as the no. 1 most wasted food in the world, with over 240 million slices of bread being chucked away every year.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Bread freezes really well (up to 3 months), and stale ones make excellent french toast and bread & butter pudding, so don't toss it out because it's old! 🥛Milk is a key ingredient in many baking recipes, which happens to be the 2nd most wasted food in the world.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you happen to have stale bread and extra milk lying around, it’s baking time!🧑🏼‍🍳Swipe left to see how you can make a quick and easy microwave bread & butter pudding in a mug.
