🍜CB Day49 - Dinner Time🥔
.
Spend the afternoon in the kitchen, trying to create an authentic Malay Cuisine & it's sides.
.
Conclusion: still able to come close to it, can try another recipe for the soup base next time. Seriously, I think cannot lazy, really must make my own rempah to cook the soup. I used pre-mix rempah with home made chicken soup.
.
Happy with my bergedil! A recipe I've learnt during my school days during "Home Economic" class! 🤣🤣🤣
.
Happy Belly!!!
