A free FUN and Interactive Show for your kids during #CircuitBreakerSG while they 🏡#StayHomeSG

We will be making non-toxic 🛁 Bath Bombs together with the kids. Conducted by our Certified Organic Skincare Formulator and Founder, Hann Chia, there will be a 𝙇𝙄𝙑𝙀 demonstration and the show will end with 𝗬𝗼𝗴𝗮 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗞𝗶𝗱𝘀 (conducted by Marilyn, Founder | Theta Space Singapore). Register early as we will teach the Kids to craft professionally formulated Bath Bombs which require preparation for ingredients and equipment. The access link will be allocated in order of comments received. Please follow below steps to get the link to participate.

Parents 👪, you can also join in by sending a photo 🖼 of a bath product 🧴 🧼 your kids use. We will break down the ingredient list 📝 and examine🔎 if they are toxins☠ or irritants. We will teach you to read ingredient lists of children cleansing products to empower 💪 you to make better and healthier choices for your family >>
✅ Type in "Clean me up" in the comment section below 👇🏻 to get a link from us to participate. We will send you the list of items to prepare (for the Bath Bombs) before the Show. Limited slots available
