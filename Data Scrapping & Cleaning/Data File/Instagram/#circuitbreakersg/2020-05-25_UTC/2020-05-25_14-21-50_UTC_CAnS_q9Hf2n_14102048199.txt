Some parents are concerned that schools will be reopening next week. Others face a quandary with no one to look after their children doing HBL.
.
To help, Iâ€™ve put together a simple guide for parents of pre-school and primary school children. Hopefully this helps to explain some of the measures taken and clarify what to expect when school reopens.

All opinions are my own and this guide is not endorsed by any entities. Information collated from interviews and public posts by Education Minister @ongyekung and @straits_times @channelnewsasia
