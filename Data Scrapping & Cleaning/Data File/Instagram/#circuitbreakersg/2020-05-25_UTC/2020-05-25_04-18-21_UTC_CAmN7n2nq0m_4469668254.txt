Penning down before I send them off to their new homes and a memory for me of how I spent my weekends during the circuit breaker. 
As a Sanrio fan, I couldn’t help lay my hands and ordered these lovely prints to add on to my cloth collection. *pocket burnt* 
These has to be one of the largest batch (20 pieces) that I’ve sewn over the last 2 days. Had to finish them before the circuit breaker ends and everyone returns back to the norm.
