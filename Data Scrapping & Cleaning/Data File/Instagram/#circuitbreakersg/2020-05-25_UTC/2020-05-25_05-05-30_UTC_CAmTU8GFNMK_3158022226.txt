This plate has #inippuğŸ˜‹ #kasappuğŸ˜– #thuvarpuğŸ˜’ & my #makkal will eat this without showing #salippuğŸ™„ #veruppuğŸ˜« #kaduppuğŸ˜¡ because eating junk "often" is #thappuğŸ™† & will give you #aapuğŸ˜© . Also Remember, taking care of your health is your own #poruppu ğŸ™‹.

On my plate with #karuppu color items (just sharing whatever is practised at home.),
ğŸ’® Angaya podi with Ghee. This has manthakali /black nightshade berry, sundaikkai/turkey berry, neem flower, Kandathipli, arisi thipli (pepper varieties), dry ginger & many more. Good for digestion.
ğŸ’® Vepampoo mor rasam / Neem flower buttermilk rasam - This is consumed hot after recovering from cold.
ğŸ’®Sweet potato fry - this is the combo to balance the bitterness specially given at our home to make kids like these recipes.
