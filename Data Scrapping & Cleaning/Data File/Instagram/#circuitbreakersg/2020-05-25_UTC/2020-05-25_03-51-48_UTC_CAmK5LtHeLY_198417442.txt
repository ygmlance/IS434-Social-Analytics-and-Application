💖Michelin Star Herbal Hor Fun from @shihuiyuan.sg💖

I love hor fun with gravy. And when I saw them on Instagram previously I wanted to try them. Their gravy is not the usual soy sauce gravy. It is a herbal braising sauce made from over 30 different herbs and stewed with meat and bones of their chicken and duck so it is packed with collagen! Gravy was thick, complex and multi-dimensional in flavour. Strong herbal notes but wasn’t bitter and matched perfectly with the smooth and silky hor fun! 😍

The duck meat and spare ribs were so tender. And the mushroom was soft and bouncy. It comes with two pieces of boy choy but I self add on more Shanghai greens because I need my vegetables. 😜

And the chilli looks like chicken rice chilli but it is way better than your regular chilli. It is tangy as well. Not too spicy because my mum who can’t take spicy loved their chilli as well. We added into our hor fun gravy and somehow it tasted a bit like assam laksa. 💓 Dish was already superb and chilli made it even more appetising. 😋 I practically finished my food in minutes. Was super hungry after my legs workout. And super happy that my meal came on time. Thanks @grab_sg for the prompt delivery. This meal really made my day! 🤗
My mum also enjoyed their hor fun non stop praising how yummy their gravy was! 👍
