*#Saving Gaia*

The Strait Times, colour challenge has been very motivating and therapeutic, during the Circuit Breaker... this one, specially was a real challenge as it has very minute  details which required a lot of attention... SAVING GAIA, being the theme, it has a lot of flora n fauna, the present and  a futuristic world and the three palms which I thought  represented  the continents..... a lot of thinking and fun,  with a limited choice of stationary as my markers were giving up and a deadline.. this was one of the best images I enjoyed colouring... Thankyou Strait Times for keeping us engaged and motivated... #stayathome
