One part of the body that we don't pay alot of attention to is our kidneys😧. They work to flush out waste in the body so that blood can move purely and effectively to nourish our cells.
.
At our meridian #yinyoga class 🧘‍♀️we guide our students to stimulate a specific meridian, and this evening's class will be on the kidney meridian. Meridians are lines of energy ⚡️that flow through the body and can affect various organs, including our kidneys. They also affect circulation, and the general function of our body and the state of our #mentalself or #emotionalhealth.
.
Meridian yin yoga can use to detox the back body and clear out blockages along the kidney meridian lines.
🤢When there are blockages, we experience anxiety, reproductive issues, urinary problems, pain in back/neck/throat.
😀When these lines are clear we can feel vibrant, confident, and calm.
.
Begin your rejuvenation💓 by joining us at our meridian #yinyoga class today at 8.30pm.
