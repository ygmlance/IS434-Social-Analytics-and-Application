#circuitbreakerday48 x Mandatory Leave Day 6 // Hot #mushroomsoup x contrasty #poachedegg x umami-enhancing black truffle salsa, in a rough #mudrockceramics bowl that did only good things for the #somatosensory system, was a fantastic thing to have on a stormy afternoon.

(Not so great though for the other people in the #zoombiblestudy who had the un-muted anti-ASMR of metal-scrapping-rough ceramic.)

Our overview of #gospelofmark 1-8 was rather, ahem, eye-opening. Read and talked about all at once, it became clear to us that Mark wrote his Gospel deliberately to show his readers:
• after thousands of years of promises and prophecies from the Fall, the #kingdomofgod had finally arrived with Jesus (Mark 1:15)!
.
• the surprise was that people had to be persuaded to actually believe the #goodnews (Mark 1:15) - as if people were fundamentally self-sabotaging.
.
• this was shown to be frustratingly true: - Jesus performed distinctive miracles that demonstrated that he wasn’t a liar, or a lunatic, but actually God (Mark 1-3, 5), who had come to rescue people from the consequences of the Fall (disability, disease, disasters, demons, death).
- The rescue was like that never-forgotten rescue of Israelites from Egypt in Exodus (Mark 6,8).
- Yet the hardness of heart/bad soil (Mark 4) of the Pharisees and teachers of the law, was that they simply refused to believe that the God they claimed to worship had finally come to rescue them. Instead they accused him of being from Satan and planned to murder him. Even his family thought he was mad and/or demon-possessed. - It seems *they* were from Satan instead (7:9-13).
.
• Something fundamental needed to be done to all their ears, eyes, and hearts (7:14-23) first before they could see Jesus for who he was and repent and take hold of his rescue! (Cue: healing of deaf man (7:31-36), blind man (8:22-26) - but looks like this won’t happen all at once?).
.
The challenge to us was whether we would accept the good news of Jesus that he really is God, Lord, Rescuer. Otherwise, we continue to stand with Satan - opposed to God.
