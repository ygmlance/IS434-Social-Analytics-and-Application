Homemade Orh Nee (or Teochew Yam Paste)
It wasn’t as tough as I thought, maybe because I didn’t have to process the gingko nuts which I happily excluded 😬.
Summarised recipe: Cube the yam 🍠, slice the pumpkin 🎃, steam them till soft. Blend the yam with a little bit of water. Fry the blended yam in shallot oil (just fry sliced small onions in 150ml of oil) on low heat. It is done when the oil is just incorporated. Serve with pumpkin on top, drizzled in syrup (1:1 ratio of water and fine sugar over low heat). .
