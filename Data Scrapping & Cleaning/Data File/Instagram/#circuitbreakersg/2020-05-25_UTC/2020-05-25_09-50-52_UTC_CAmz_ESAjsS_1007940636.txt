Weâ€™ve had a few too many rainy, thundery days lately and what with the whole #circuitbreakersg we have definitely not been getting enough outdoor time. So we walked up to Dempsey Hill and then to the Botanic Gardens. I spotted this #kingfisher in Dempsey Hill. So many beautiful birds in #singaporeðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ #expatlifestyle #expatlifesingapore #expatwives #singaporeinsiders #urbanjunglehome #singaporenature #urbannature #circuitbreaker #natureloversofinstagram
