****CLOSED***
[GIVEAWAY TIME!] We are one week away from returning our kids to schools ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³. Time to arm our kids with the right gear to protect themselves. 
Digging out of our own pockets. A Little Footprint is giving away 3 sets of Back-to-School carepack to 3 of our followers. 
1 carepack will consist of â˜†1 bottle of Spick (60ml) Antiseptic Germicide Disinfectant Spray which is our go-to sanitizer for hands, and wiping down our phones and bags when we get home. It's safe for little hands â˜†3 pieces of Zappy Alcohol Wipes, for the days when we can finally be able to dine in at restaurants and you need to wipe the table down. â˜†3 pieces of kids disposable 3-ply masks. Always good to have one in the school bag for standby. 
I wish I could give more in each kit, but I only have 1 box of kids masks and 1 bag of the Zappy wipes. 
Thanks to @nichebabies for kindly sponsoring when she heard I was going to do this, 1 of the winners will also be getting a Spick Kids Wound Wash. No stinging when you wash an open wound!
