Yasssss. I made Chicken Essence Chicken Rice! 🐔🍚
.
Chicken Rice is cooked with @newmoonsg Premium Fragrant Rice & Hainanese Chicken Rice Paste. A bit soggy cause I added too much water, but really fragrant 🌾
.
Chicken Essence Chicken requires just a bottle of @newmoonsg Essence of Chicken, soy sauce, mushrooms, goji berry, ginger & garlic and steam for about 15min 🐥
.
The ingredients are available at www.newmoon.com.sg. They are having many other bundle deals for #circuitbreaker now so go check it out 🎁
.
Thank you Goh Joo Hin @newmoonsg for sending these over! 🙇‍♂️
