Presenting..Kueh Kosui!!The one dessert in our home that we can NEVER get enough of, it is SUPER addictive! The first piece goes into your mouth..then the second..third..and fourth..you tell yourself this will be the last but your mouth says ‘just one more’
.
We all sat around the dining table waiting for the moment the kueh set so we could get our hands on it hahahahah 
It’s so good and so much more delicious than store bought ones!! Sweet, warm, soft and sticky, 入口即化 (melts the moment it’s in your mouth)
The secret is in getting really good gula melaka - we always buy packs of it whenever we’re in Malaysia because it’s just SO fresh and fragrant
. 
It’s also super easy to make, so try it at home this CB!
