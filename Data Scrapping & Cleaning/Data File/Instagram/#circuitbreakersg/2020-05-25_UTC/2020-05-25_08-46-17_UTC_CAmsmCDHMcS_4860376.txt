Mum’s first attempt at making one of my very favorite kinds of #friedchicken— #harcheonggai , which is chicken coated with fermented prawn paste then deep-fried. (If you’ve never tasted this, the umami in these bites is unforgettable.) She was dismayed that one batch got REALLY charred, but I actually liked those better. Lovely caramelization on those pieces. Not perfect but not bad. #latergram #harjeonggai #chinesefriedchicken #pollo #pollofritto #cibocinese #cena #dinner #supper #mumscooking #kitchenexperiments #sgfood #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreaker #sglife #instafood #singaporeanhomecooking #chinesehomecooking #homecooking
