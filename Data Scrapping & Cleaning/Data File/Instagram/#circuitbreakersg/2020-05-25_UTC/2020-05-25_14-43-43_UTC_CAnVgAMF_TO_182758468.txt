Received my ribeye delivery today, so in the mood for some beef
. ❤️Beef Bowl with Onsen egg

Ingredients
- 1 ribeye
- 100g shimeji mushroom, chopped
- rice, cooked
- egg
- salt
- pepper
- furikake
- 20g butter
- egg
- 1 tbsp oil
- truffle oil (optional)
. 
Steps
1. Saute mushroom until all liquid evaporated. Season with salt and pepper. Put aside for later use

2. Boil water. In a container, put egg and pour hot water over the egg until fully submerged. Cover container and wait for about 10 mins (time depends on the number of eggs and type of container used). After 10 mins, put egg in ice bath to stop it from cooking

3. Pat dry the ribeye with kitchen towel. Season generously with salt and pepper. I have cut the ribeye into half for plating purposes

4. In a pan, on high heat. Heat oil. Put in the ribeye and let it cook for for about 1 min 45 sec, flip the ribeye and put in garlic and butter. Baste the ribeye for another 1 min and 45 sec. Remove ribeye from pan and let it rest (cook time depends on how cooked you want the beef to be)
.
5. Pour furikake into rice and mix well

To serve, scoop rice into a bowl. Lay mushroom on top of rice. Slice beef & place it on top of mushroom. Drizzle some truffle oil onto the beef, if desired. Crack & place egg in the centre. Serve with some pickled radish
