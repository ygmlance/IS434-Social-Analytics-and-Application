Friendships While Social Distancing üíì

During this circuit breaker period, some of us might feel being isolated. Sometimes, a text message or giving a buzz to your friends or business associates just to say hello or take care meant a lot to one another üíñ

I missed my friends‚Äô gatherings and one of them is @fionascng . She is my #insuranceagent since I am 18 years old. .
.
Guess what? My first pay cheque was to get myself an insurance policy. I got to know her from one of my classmates. Chemistry and fate bring us together and till now we are still together. .
.
I am thankful that she has seen through my life milestones (21 years old birthday celebration, my wedding, both kids‚Äô birth, full month celebrations and birthday parties etc). When I am hospitalised few times, she was the one who helped me for all the necessary insurance claims. When my daughter was hospitalised every year since born till 4 years plus. She was there to pray for her and me. .

We dun get to meet nor talk to each other often. However, Fiona will always make an effort to send her regards and giving me lovely surprises. Am blessed ‚ù§Ô∏è & thanks for your sweet treats from @taicheongsg . .

This pandemic outbreak has prompted people to grow closer in some ways, as old friends reconnect and neighbors become like family. People have fewer casual interactions, but the relationships that remain have deepened.
