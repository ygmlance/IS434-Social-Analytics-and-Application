The Singapore government laid down the details for residents to follow during the circuit breaker policy. For example, people could do exercise by running or walking around the neighborhood. Buses are still operating. However, there are very few passengers. People call the Singapore government a nanny state wherein residents enjoy the meticulous arrangements by the government. Â Under COVID-19, the government distributes free masks to all residents. The 3rd mask collection exercise will roll out tomorrow.
