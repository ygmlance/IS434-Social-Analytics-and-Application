Monday morning memories to last year at @youngliving's International Grand Convention where @imaginedragons rocked the closing night. We were all on a high from the week of learning and hustling (and shopping and lack of sleep) that we may or may not have been dancing on the street. Okay, it was just the stadium parking lot but still 😂💃🏻
