Nuyolk will be matching and donating the total number of eggs ordered online to the less privileged in rental flats.

This is the best time to purchase your eggs and have charity done in the comfort of your home. 🏡
You may choose to have your eggs delivered at a later date too. My referral code is applicable on that day too. Use my code "theflyingketo" under notes and get  additional 4 free eggs. .
The  total number of eggs donated will be announced and a statement from the charity to validate the receipt.
