Accidental yummy find from Yishun Park Hawker Centre when we went there to dabao Ah Tan chicken wing rice.
Saw this stall called Munchi Delights selling mee jiang kuehs and bought 1 slice of original peanut and 1 charcoal coconut.
They turn out to be so so good. The kuehs are soft yet chewy with a slight mochi texture, and the edges are crispy. The shredded coconut filling is moist and not too sweet, while the peanut filling is the best I have ever eaten, so dense, creamy and 'peanuty' to the max.
Will return soon to try the other flavours
