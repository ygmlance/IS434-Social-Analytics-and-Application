Christmas came super early at #SongHomeCafe with this peppermint mocha drink! Made some homemade peppermint syrup by boiling a bunch of fresh peppermint leaves with sugar and water. ⁣
⁣
Add that to a pump of chocolate sauce, some milk, milk foam and a shot of espresso. As usual, I'm using @nespresso.sg - this drink I used the now phased out Dharkan (sobs) ⁣
⁣
Finished with a sprinkle of cocoa powder and some peppermint leaves.⁣
