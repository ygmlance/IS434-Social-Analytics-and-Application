Girl’s 1st attempt baking Apple Custard Crumble Pie for our teatime! Another delicious bake done by her. 😋. .

This circuit breaker period she really amazes us with her baking & cooking skills! Without any guidance from me, all her first attempts turned out to be successful and good! 👍👍👍.
.

Her younger brother even asked her to consider to be a chef instead of pursing her dream to be a doctor! 😂🤣😂.
.

The pie is so delicious and I’ve asked her to share her recipe and she said she combined 5-6 recipes with some modifications and gave me her scribbled notes. (Swipe 🔙☝️ if you wanna try out her recipe and can understand it!😄, there’s also a short video at the end.)
.

Note what’s not mentioned in her scribbled notes: 
1. Blind bake pie crust with ceramic weights using bottom heat fan forced 180°C for about 15 minutes before placing apples and pouring custard over the crust.
.

To make crumble, use a blender to blend rolled oats, brown sugar and wholemeal flour together. Exact amount unknown as she used estimation. 😄
