And just like that, the #longweekend is almost over. ⁣

Celebrated le momma’s birthday (in advance) with a hotpot meal － perfect for today’s weather! Ordered the $78 set from #BeautyinthePot. I like how everything is labelled, including cooking time for each ingredient! ⁣

Didn’t realise the 靈龍捲 wasn’t part of the set, if not, I would have ordered that. 😩 Also, the broth’s a little diluted today... Nonetheless, I think momma enjoyed her birthday meal though I think she’s more interested in the pink thermal bag that comes with the set. 🤣🤣🤣⁣
