This one is for me so I that I'll not forget. Wish I am a better photographer so that I can document these strange days of coronavirus. But never let perfect be the enemy of good, so I try. 
Singapore started social distancing, first with a crossed out seat on a bench. Then came circuit breaker (semi lockdown) on 6 April where no loitering is allowed, so the whole bench is now taped off. Almost one and half months since and now it is more familiar than strange.
