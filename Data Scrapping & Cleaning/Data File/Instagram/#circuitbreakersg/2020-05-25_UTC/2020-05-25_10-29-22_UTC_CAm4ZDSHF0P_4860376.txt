My aunt has been sewing up a storm for Masks Sewn With Love — a #Singapore group that will give volunteers who can sew the cut-out fabric, nose pieces etc. so they can put together these masks for cleaners, domestic helpers and the less fortunate. Look at how pretty these masks by my Auntie D. are! If you live in Singapore and have a sewing machine, check out the group — just do a search for that name on Facebook and you’ll find it... #masks #sglife #covidlife #sgunited #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #cblife #facemasks
