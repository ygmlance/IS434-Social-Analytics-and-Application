Side Squat Twist with overhead Halo

#7daythighchallenge with #blogilates 
Decided to do the thigh challenge instead of Glutes since it just came out! 
Why am I so obsessed with all these fitness challenges? It always keeps me accountable for what I do.. These are like mini goals.. Of cos, I cannot expect extreme results in a short span of 7 days.. But looking back since I started the 7 days AB challenge (I only skip the Glutes), I feel so much stronger and fitter. Thanks to Cassey Ho for all these mini challenges! When I get back to work, my time for workout will be greatly reduced so I need to put in all my efforts now.. Haha.. And why strength training with weights? Cos it is another level up.. Your body will build a resistance to your weight and one way to push it harder is to add weights. But be cautious.. Training with weights is another ball game.. I am physical ed trained educator, so I understand the principles of training too.. Though my form may not be perfect, it is always work in progress. I'm always having knee joint pain and cracking knees and ankles all due to sports injuries.. So, listen to your body! 
And Selamat Hari Raya to all my Muslim friends! Thank you for the extra holiday so my husband can spend more time with the family... Time flies.. Last week of my holidays. Time flies so fast. And it's back to work! 
Enjoy your week!
