Deal done All in 1 week 100% virtually! Client appointed me as their exclusive agent last week after my Zoom proposal and with the great teamwork between the sellers and we managed to list and sold the property at the first virtual viewing ! 
The happiest part of the deal was that I was able to help my client meet their objective in the shortest possible time! And they were happy with the results! Thankful for their trust!

I courier the option to purchase out at 11.30pm yesterday 😂 
This deal was only possible because of my client’s trust and their willingness to cooperate to help be my “web cam” during the virtual showing!  It can be difficult for buyers to visualise the place, but with right preparation work I was able to help orientated them and they were comfortable with what they are buying !

Welcome to the world of digital property purchase. 
This is a new era.

Thank be to God for all your provisions in my life. 🙌🏻 PS: I could get use to talking to black screen 🤣
