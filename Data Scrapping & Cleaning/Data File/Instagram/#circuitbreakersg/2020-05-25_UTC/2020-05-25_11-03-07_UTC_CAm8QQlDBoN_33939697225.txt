~ Coq Au Vin ~ Tried making coq au vin today. Halfway through marination, I realised we don't have any burgundy wine so I made do with a cabinet sauvignon. The colour is not that right but it tasted yummy nonetheless. For the Simlets, I replaced wine with red grape juice. Lol. It became grape reduction after simmering and they enjoyed a nice sweet chicken dish. #simletseat #toddlerfood #sghomecooking #healthykidsfood #instafood #coqauvin #frenchfood #redwine #grapejuice #sgmummy #mumlife #sahm #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #iworkathomenotworkfromhome
