In 10 years’ time you won’t give a flying f*ck what you weighed during quarantine.

You won’t look back and think “thank god I followed [insert fad diet here] during lockdown!”. You will care about your relationship with food and what your body is capable of doing.

You might remember this time as the moment you kicked off new habits, or you might not. Both options are fine.

But FOR THE LOVE OF CARBS stop focusing on short-term “fixes” that don’t “fix” shit. You don’t need to fix yourself. 
The journey to accepting and respecting and appreciating your body without diets and all that crap is a long one. It’s going to take your whole life. Probably. 
So stop worrying so much about what you weigh today, okay? 💕
