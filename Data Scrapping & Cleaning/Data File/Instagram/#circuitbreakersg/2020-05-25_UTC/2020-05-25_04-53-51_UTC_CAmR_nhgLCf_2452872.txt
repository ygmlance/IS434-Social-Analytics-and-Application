Solitude is endless. A whole new world. The desert. I am thinking talking in images. I don’t know how to write them down. Every feeling is physical. Maybe that’s why I can’t write or write so badly now. In the desert, all ideas are experimental in the body. I touch a central place, where I have never lived before. I wrote from the margin, dipping down into the well but never fully gazing down. I drew up the words- books, essays. Now I ‘m down there:in the centre. And I find, to my horror, that the center is mute.
- Susan Sontag
