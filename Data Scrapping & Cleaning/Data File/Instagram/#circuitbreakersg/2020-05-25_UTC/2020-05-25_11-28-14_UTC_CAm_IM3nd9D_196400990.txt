Dinner this evening, was another clearance exercise! Last night’s Nasi Minyak, or Scented Rice, was further “enhanced” in the wok with more butter, a sprinkle of salt, and a spoon of fried shallots mixed in, upgrading it from yesterday’s bland, to today’s delicious! Also part of the clearance, was the Sop Buntut, or Indonesian Oxtail Soup that has been in the freezer since 7th April. Defrosted and reheated, it was also delicious, with a full, rich flavour. Finally, the last of the spinach in the fridge was stir-fried with minced garlic, sliced onions and red chillies, and seasoned with a swirl of superior light soya sauce. Overall, a very satisfying dinner! 😋 #nasiminyak #scentedrice #sopbuntut #oxtailsoup #bayamgoreng #stirfriedspinach #reheatedleftovers #nowastemeal #homecooking #homecookedmeal #homecookeddinner #eatathome #stayathome #stopcovid19 #circuitbreakersg
