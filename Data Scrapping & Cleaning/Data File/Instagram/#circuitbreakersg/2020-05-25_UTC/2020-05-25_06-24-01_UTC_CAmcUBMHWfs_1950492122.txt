I woke up this morning wanting to #wfh 🤦🏻‍♀️ Didn’t feel like a Public Holiday at all. In fact since the #circuitbreakersg started, I have already lost touch of the date. Who’s with me?

Our conversation last night when we were watching a 📺 program. It was showing some lovely food in Vietnam. We should be there if not for this #covid19 Out of the blue, Zahn said:

🙍🏻‍♂️”What? (Referring to the cancelled trip) I would have met my ex girlfriend! 🤦🏻‍♂️”
.
🙎🏻‍♀️ “Your ex-girlfriend is in Vietnam now?! Who’s that?!”
.
🙍🏻‍♂️ “Yes mom. Aiyo you don’t know? 🤦🏻‍♂️”
.
🤦🏻‍♀️ “Who?!!!!”
.
🙎🏻‍♂️ “It’s H!” (Paused) “But mom, what is ex-girlfriend?”
.
🙎🏻‍♀️ “😤😤😤”
