I’ve got you ondeh my skin 🎼 
When I was a kid, I was very attracted by the colour of ondeh ondeh. The little green ball just looks very inviting for me to eat! When I took a bite, it’s all about the gula Melaka filling 😛 yes, such a sweet tooth since young right! 
Ondeh ondeh is a popular snack in Singapore and also widely reinvent as other deserts flavour like ice cream and cake (oh let me tell you a secret! @inthebrickyard ondeh ondeh cake is classic👌🏻) I hope that these local snacks can be passed down to generations because they tell a story of the time 💚
