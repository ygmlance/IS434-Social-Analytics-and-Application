✔ 10 months old medium fur cross-breed
✔ Affectionate, gentle, curious
✔ Independent yet a great companion
✔ Suitable for 1st time cat owners & multi-cat households (with proper introduction) ✔ Dewormed, deflead, vaccinated, will be sterilised soon ✔ Positive for FIV*, negative for FeLV

*In practical terms, what this means is that her immune system will need some extra looking after. FIV cats can live a long & healthy life. Multi-cat households are also ok, provided they all get along!
