⬅️SWIPE miss @jumboseafoodsg during #circuitbreakersg ? Try their bento 🍱 set. The restaurant has created 6 choices of bento set. The price range S$10.80 to S$12.80. The bento comes with one seafood dish, one poultry, one vegetables or tohu and plain or fried rice. Food is well prepared and pack. I love the prawn cooked in Chili crab sauce. The kong-bao chicken is my favourite! You may place your order on their website, or @deliveroo_sg or @foodpandasg. Rating : 4🍟/5 🇸🇬 #foodie #singaporefood #cb #bento #jumboseafood
