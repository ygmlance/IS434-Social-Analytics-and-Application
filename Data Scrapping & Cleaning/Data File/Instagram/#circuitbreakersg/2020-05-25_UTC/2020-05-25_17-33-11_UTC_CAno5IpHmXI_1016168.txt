#Circuitbreakersg day 49

Quite shocking that itâ€™s almost 50 days into CCB. 
Happy EID MUBARAK to all our Muslim friends. Didnâ€™t feel like it but this is a very different year. Stay safe everyone! 
Dinner was so uneventful : 
I totally forgot to take a picture except this one and half way thru eating it. ðŸ”º Plain porridge with an assortment of salted, fermented accompaniments ðŸ”º Quick fry veggies with dace in black beans ~
