🎼🛎 Lyra’s musical diary🎶🎵

Let’s do the solfege practice! This time we used deskbells from @artists_music_studio to make it more fun. Again, she wants to play the “Hot Cross Bun”.
•
After many video takes, these are one of the best. But she got distracted by an ant 🐜 at the last 2 notes, and she doubled the D, followed by the spoiler video act!
•
By the time we took the “Twinkle twinkle little star video”, she just couldnt sit still anymore.

Video 1: Scale
