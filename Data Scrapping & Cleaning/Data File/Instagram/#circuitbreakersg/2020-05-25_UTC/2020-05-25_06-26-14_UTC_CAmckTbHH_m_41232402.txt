Me in my house minding my own business.

Grab Delivery guy at the door: Hello?

Me walking to the door: Yes?

Grab Delivery guy: 1x-xxx? Amanda???
.
Me: Amanda? There is no Amanda here. You sure you sent to the right place? .
.
Grab Delivery guy: 1x-xxx right? Let me call the sender and confirm.

Me: Amanda you say? Let me call my fiancee and see if these are from her.

@chen.xiaohan05 I have been surprising you during this CB period by sending food over and didnt expect you to do the same for me. I was really taken by surprise when you sent food from one of my favourite bakery. Haha. Thank you for loving me although you were worried that I might not like it (who doesnt love @tiongbahrubakery ?), I must say it feels good receiving surprises like this from you. üòù ü•∞ #xtanchenjourneyx #surprised #circuitbreakersg #stupidcovid19
