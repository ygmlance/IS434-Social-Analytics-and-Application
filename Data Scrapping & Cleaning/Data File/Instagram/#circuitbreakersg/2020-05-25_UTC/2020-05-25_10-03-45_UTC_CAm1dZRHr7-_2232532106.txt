#Quarandining recently with canned chickpeas, frozen pork shoulder (even budget cuts now up $2 to the kilogram), reconstituted coconut milk, and coriander resuscitated from the wilted clump in the dark recesses of the fridge. Eggs from Singapore’s last farmlands. #quédateencasa #circuitbreakersg #lockdownlunch #pantryraid #everythingcurry #salamat
