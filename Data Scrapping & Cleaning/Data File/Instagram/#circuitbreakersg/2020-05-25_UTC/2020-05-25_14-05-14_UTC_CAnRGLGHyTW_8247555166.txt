Takeout dinner from @compassonesg with DIY salad from @rollwithmakisan, egg prata and bee hoon goreng from @mybriyanihouse, and nasi lemak from @cravenasilemak! 🍴
✨
Salad was good as usual. First time trying the Korean bulgogi sauce and it was not bad cos quite spicy 😂. The prata was not very nice though. Perhaps it wasn’t eaten on the spot, so it was kind of soggy. Nasi lemak tasted better than I remembered it to be. The chicken wing was 👍🏻 but the chilli was too sweet for me 😅. What’s your favourite dish here? 🥗🍳🍝🍛
