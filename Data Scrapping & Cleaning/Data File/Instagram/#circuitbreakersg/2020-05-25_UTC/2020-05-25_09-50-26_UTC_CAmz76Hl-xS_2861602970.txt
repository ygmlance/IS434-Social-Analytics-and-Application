Hi Tea time! 
Today’s Mua chee is special (recipe below⬇️) as there’s filling in the mochi😱😍 unlike traditional mua chee which is usually plain glutinous rice balls) 
Also had Red bean soup and QQ sweet potato balls again. This time with dual color sweet potatoes💛💜 Here is a simple and easy to make recipe: 
You will need 2 things: 
Frozen Mochi, got it from @freshfood_mrjoy 
Ground peanut powder with sugar
(pandan leave is optional to cook with boiling water for pandan fragrance)

Method:
1. Boil frozen mochi for 5-8mins, longer if u want softer. (It is ready when it floats up) 
2. Remove and drain, Let it cool for a short while.
3. Coat the mochi with ground peanut powder & done!

Time taken 10 mins?

The Frozen mochi are from Taiwan and is actually meant for steamboat. Will be trying some for hotpot next round! 
@freshfood_mrjoy is having a promo for the Steamboat Mochi - 2 packets for $5.95. (1 for $3.95)

4 flavours: Original, Sesame, Peanut (this will go well with mua chee) and Cheese (surprisingly this is my fav!) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
