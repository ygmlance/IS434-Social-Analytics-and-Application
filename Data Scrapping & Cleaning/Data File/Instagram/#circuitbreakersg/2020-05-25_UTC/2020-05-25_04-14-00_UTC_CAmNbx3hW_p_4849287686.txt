What better way to spend a public holiday with your family than baking a batch of brownie for them. Made using sweet potato, reducing the amount of flour & sugar used! Best served warm with a scoop of your favourite ice cream. #brownies #covidbaking #dessert #circuitbreakersg #stayhomewithascott #healthierdessert #sghomebaking
