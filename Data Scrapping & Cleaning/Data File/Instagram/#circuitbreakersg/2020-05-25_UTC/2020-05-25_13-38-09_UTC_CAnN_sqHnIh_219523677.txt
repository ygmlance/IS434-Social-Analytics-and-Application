Rosemary and garlic lamb chops with homemade mint sauce, made from scratch - Probably one of my best dishes during this CB. 
With the ongoing stress from work, cooking and baking have become the only way to distract myself and calm my nerves during this CB. And it definitely plants a smile on my face whenever i see my boys enjoying the food. 
Guess weâ€™re gonna dine-in more at home rather than going for restaurants even after the CB. Not a very good thing i guess?
