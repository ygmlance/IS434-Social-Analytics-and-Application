For five years now, I’ve not #dabao-d anything so as not to be a part of disposables. If I am not carrying my own reusable takeout containers with me (not always possible), I will eat in situ, and I put effort into organising my life and work and mindset to be able to do so. How to rearrange life again now that eating in situ is not an option? I’ll figure it out. For now, I reuse the disposable containers to pack food to give to others. #lanzhoubeefnoodles #widenoodles #noodletakeaway #circuitbreakersg
