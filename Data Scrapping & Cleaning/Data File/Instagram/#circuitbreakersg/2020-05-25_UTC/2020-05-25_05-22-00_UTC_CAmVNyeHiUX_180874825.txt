Things I miss: Treks in nature, the energy of a hot yoga class, brisk swims on blazing afternoons.

Laughing with my friends over drinks instead of Discord, connecting with an interviewee over coffee, not Zoom.

The rare Saturday night out, in my reddest lip and a little black dress.

When public holidays felt less like work days, and a bit of grousing could make you feel good, not guilty.

Until then: Happy Monday, yâ€™all. Hang in there ðŸ–¤
