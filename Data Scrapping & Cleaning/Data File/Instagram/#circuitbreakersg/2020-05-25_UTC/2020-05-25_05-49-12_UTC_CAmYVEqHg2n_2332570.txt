We treated ourselves to a special lunch today from @thevar.sg. The most amazing -Cured Yellow Tail, Podi Idli with Coconut Chutney
- Buttermilk Golgappa
- Chettinad Chicken Nachos
- Pork Shami Kebab
- Grilled Cauliflower and Eggplant Dip 
all complemented with some spice infused delectable cocktails.  Too bad we had to share with the kids ðŸ¤£. Finger and plate licking good ðŸ˜‹
