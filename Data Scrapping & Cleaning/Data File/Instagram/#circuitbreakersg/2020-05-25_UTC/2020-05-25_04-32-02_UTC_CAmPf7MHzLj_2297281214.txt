Sunday is certainly no fun day if you're suffering from aches and stiffness in the lower back. @osteopathichealthcare's David Farrelly @paddlingosteo.singapore demonstrates a seated lower back stretch that may help ease some of the lower back stiffness caused by incorrect posture while using the computer or a bad couch-potato posture while binge-watching Korean dramas.
Lower Back Stretch
• Keep your body upright while seated
• Place one hand on the outside of the opposite knee (eg. right hand on left knee)
• Using that same hand gently pull on the knee and slowly rotate/turn your body (eg. right hand gently pulls on left knee to rotate/turn the body towards the left)
• Hold the stretch for 15 seconds
• Repeat 4 times on each side
