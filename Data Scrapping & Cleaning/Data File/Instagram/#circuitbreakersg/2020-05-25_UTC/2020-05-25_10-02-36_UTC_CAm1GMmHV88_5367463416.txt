Hygiene is all the craze now - and it should be! Better safe than sorry right? Our little customers (your baby, not you haha) have very delicate, sensitive skin and we know that. This is why we decided to make our own sanitisers! We made them with very few simple ingredients that pack a punch, ⁠
⁠
✅Distilled Water⁠
✅Veg Glycerin⁠
✅Citrus Extracts⁠
✅Citric Acid ⁠
✅Malic Acid ⁠
⁠
You can use these sanitisers to sanitise toys, high chairs, tables before meals and of course the trusty baby stroller and car seat!⁠
