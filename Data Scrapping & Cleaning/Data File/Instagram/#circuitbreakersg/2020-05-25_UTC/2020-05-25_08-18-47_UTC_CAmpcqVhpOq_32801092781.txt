Circuit breaker Day 49: Cafe type meals for the PH! 👍 Drove over to pick these up from an ulu cafe at Seletar, got 20% off so everything here was about $64. What we ordered:
- 🥑 Smashed avocado with mushrooms on toast (think the avo was too salty, sourdough not toasted, was soggy)
- 🥯 Bagel smoked salmon with scrambled eggs (I like this combi, was supposed to be poached eggs but I changed it to scrambled)
- 🍔 Wagyu beef burger (was quite alright, but found it odd they didn’t ask for the doneness of the beef)
- 🍔 Pulled pork burger (too much BBQ sauce)
Really liked the curly fries that came with the burgers! Just like good ol’ macs curly fries.
