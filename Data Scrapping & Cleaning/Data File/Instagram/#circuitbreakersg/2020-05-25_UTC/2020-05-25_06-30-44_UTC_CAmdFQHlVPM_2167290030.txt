DAY 48, CIRCUIT BREAKER SERIES
(Countdown .... 8 days to go)
Mango Mousse

Thats a simple quick mousse with only three ingredients. The key here is which mango you use. The tastier the mango, the better the mousse tastes. I used Thai Rainbow, easily available near home, but if you can get your hands on alhponsos ... nothing like it! 
Whip a cup of cream. Add 4 tbsp of castor sugar to it. Make puree with 2 medium size mango. Add the puree to the cream and fold it in gently. Put in a bowl and refrigerate for 3-4 hours. I did use a tsp of melted gelatine, but only because I am using a regular brand of cream. The usual one is not available as of now. 
The texture stays a little soft without the gelatine. If you are ok with it, then no need to add. The gelatine gives it a more firm texture. .
