While I was on my way with my daughter to the routine Sunday grocery shopping which became my new norm during COVID-19 circuit breaker in Singapore. 
The rough idea to sing this song to have it related to #circuitbreakersg was then polished by my daughter, @yukidavidrain 
I Have Confidence from The Sound of Music is my most favourite in the entire musical and Julie Andrewâ€™s movie version is my first choice. So here I am, I hope this can lighten up your day a little if not more.
