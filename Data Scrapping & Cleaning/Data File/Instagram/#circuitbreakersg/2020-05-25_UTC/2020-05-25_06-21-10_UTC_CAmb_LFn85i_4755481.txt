Lunch. #singaporefood #friedhokkienmee 
Didn’t have #calamansi but had leftover #sambalbelacan from a #daisysdreamkitchen delivery that paired well as it’s slightly tangy. 
Also had (not pictured) the #crispyfriedlard which I rendered last week. So yummy. 
Also no #garlicchives but not going to run out to buy a few stalls of grass. 
Seafood is #fromthefreezer 
I gotta say #squid freezes really well. I cleaned and prepped it ready for cooking and bunged it in the freezer and only had to defrost it before cooking. Tasted perfectly good. Will do this again. This was the last of our #prawns from #tiongbahrumarket 
It’s been a week so time for another #groceryrun
