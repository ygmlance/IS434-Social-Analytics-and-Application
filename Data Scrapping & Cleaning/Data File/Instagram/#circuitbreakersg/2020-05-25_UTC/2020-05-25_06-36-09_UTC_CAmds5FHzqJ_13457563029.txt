Our nature corner hasn’t been updated since the lockdown started and we have been finding creative ways to connect with nature.
.
🌿 Today, we flipped through our nature journal, read the entries and examined the textures of our pressed flowers.
.
There was this page that reminded me of a time when we discovered a hibiscus shrub, with many freshly fallen flowers.
.
“The hungry caterpillar ate this red leaf!”
.
🌿It was a moment of excitement - the kids got their pails ready and picked the freshly fallen blooms; while I thought about how lucky we were to have these for studying plant anatomy!
.
Pictured here were our collection that day , some were pressed, others were made into art, a complete bloom was used for study (so lucky to spot that!) and several stalks adorned our dining table.
.
Swipe through to view all our creations.

🌿In nature play, we connect children to the world; and in this, we can kindle their love and gentleness towards this home they call Earth 🌎.

🕊 “There must be provision for the child to have contact with nature, to understand and appreciate the order, the harmony and the beauty in nature… so that the child may better understand and participate in the marvellous things which civilisation creates.” ~ Maria Montessori
