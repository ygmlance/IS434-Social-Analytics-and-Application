If not for #covid19, Merlion Park would be bustling with tourists, it would have been near impossible for mummy to take such beautiful videos. I hope you‚Äôll enjoy these great views of the Marina Downtown area as much as I enjoyed my #bicycle üö≤ ride with mummy ‚Äî except the part where we were going downslope and she was still busy taking video 2Ô∏è‚É£ balancing with one hand! üò±
Anyways, the world is a different place now and it would be a long while before life returns to the way we knew it. Even then, it won‚Äôt be exactly the same again. Wherever you are, I hope you are staying safe and healthy ‚ù§Ô∏è
