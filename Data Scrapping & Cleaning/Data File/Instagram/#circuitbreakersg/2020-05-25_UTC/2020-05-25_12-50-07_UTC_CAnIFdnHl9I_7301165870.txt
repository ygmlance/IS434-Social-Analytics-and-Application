Yesssss, as we exit the circuit breaker and enter into Phase one, @locomotionclinic will also be resuming most of our operation from 2 June 2020 onwards 🙌🏼
.
As such we will be implementing these safe measures during this period.
This includes:
💪🏼 Contact tracing via Safe Entry upon entry 💪🏼 Come in with your mask and keep them on throughout the session
💪🏼 Wash / Sanitise your hands before and after each session
💪🏼 1-1 sessions will also be staggered as well to allow thorough cleaning between patients
.
As much as we are excited to see your faces after 8 weeks, we prioritise your safety even more. We’ve worked so hard to contain the spread as a nation this far, let’s continue to be cautious and responsible for each other!
