After making hundreds of mask for charities and wearing the handmade fabric mask for months. Some of my friend who received my handmade mask was asking if I could sell the masks to their friends too. Also,during this Covid-19 period I have to stop all my makeup business,so I decided to make some mask for sale. 
When I was using the mask, I encounter some problems. First, most of the ear elastic are too loose and uncomfortable. ðŸ˜©Secondly, some of the material are difficult to breath. ðŸ˜–Third, we cannot wear much makeup after wearing mask. ðŸ¤¨

I was trying to figure out how to solve those problems. So I try to google different method to solve the ears elastic problem, and the ear guards design pop out. Some are make by plastic, some are knitting or using elastic band. So i try to made one to try out, and i realize they will drop because of our head shape and hairs. Finally I found out one way to make sure it wonâ€™t slip down, and I come out with this Anti-Slip Ear Guard. I will include an Anti- Slip Ear Guard with every purchase. ðŸ˜‰

For the fabric choice, I am using 100% cotton for the outer layer fabric and the inner fabric I am using Japanese Tencel. It is a fiber made from wood pulp of trees and itâ€™s a soft breathable and less prone to wrinkles. Good for our humid and hot weather. And all mask come with a pocket so that you can place a filter to improve the capabilities of fabric mask.

I have chosen light pinky tone for most of the women design, this is to replace our â€˜blusher and lipstickâ€™ ðŸ’‹. A nice touch of pinky color can make our face look brighter and nicer. I also try to use the pink color that suits most of our skin tone. 
I hope we wonâ€™t need this Mask for long. But if we have to use it for quite sometime, why not just get something beautiful to wear. Just like wearing a beautiful cloths ðŸ‘—
