Savoured this DIY Popiah from @hawkermansg at lunch.

Meticulously prepared using a traditional recipe chock-full of ingredients consisting of Rainbow Fillings like turnip, cabbage, carrot, French beans, bamboo shoots, garlic & yellow bean curd which makes it healthy and flavourful.

A Family Heirloom recipe since 1977 from @goodchancerestaurant
dedicated to provide premium quality Popiahs unlike those commonly available in the market.

This mouth-watering #halalcertified DIY Popiah Party Set is available for islandwide delivery for $24.90 (8 Rolls) and $29.90 (10 Rolls) via  Grabfood, Deliveroo and Foodpanda.

Since this is a DIY style, you can also be adventurous with your own Popiah assembly by adding different toppings and sauce to create your very own: Otah, Cheese, Curry or Crispy Chicken Skin.

All food are MUIS Halal Certified and available for Islandwide delivery. For more details visit www.tenderfresh.com.sg
