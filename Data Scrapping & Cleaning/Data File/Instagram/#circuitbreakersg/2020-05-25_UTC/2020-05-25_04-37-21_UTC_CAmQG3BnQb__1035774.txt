It has been ages since I last went for my evening spin... Especially so during the Covid-19 Circuit Breaker Lockdown. Next up we will be embarking into Phase 1, whereby more essential businesses are able to resume from 02Jun. Lets sing to the tune "Where The Streets Have No Name".. I want to run
I want to hide
I want to tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I want to reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name.. I want to feel, sunlight on my face
See that dust cloud dissappear without a trace
I want to take shelter from that poison rain
Where the streets have no name...
