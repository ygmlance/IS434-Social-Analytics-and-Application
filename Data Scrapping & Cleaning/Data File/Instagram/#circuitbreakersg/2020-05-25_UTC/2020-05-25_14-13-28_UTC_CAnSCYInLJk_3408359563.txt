Day 49 of #lockdown2020 / #circuitbreakersg (25 May 2020) - #nofilter #homecooked #dinnerforone - Finally used the last of the #leftover chicken from Day 45 (yes, I made 4 meals out of that $4.90 roast chicken!) to make a mini chicken #potpie using the chicken bones and skin to make a broth together for the filling, with the half of the carrot that I didn't use in the filling. The filling was #yummy but the crust was too thick and spoiled it for me. Will learn from this. #homecooking #stayhomestaysafe
