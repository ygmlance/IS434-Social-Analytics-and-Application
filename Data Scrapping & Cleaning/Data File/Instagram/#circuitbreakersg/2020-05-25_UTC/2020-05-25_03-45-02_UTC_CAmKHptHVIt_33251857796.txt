Stay home barber skills upgrade 💇🏻‍♀️
Left: How I look like with a facemask & overgrown fringe & locks 😕
Right: Happy me with lighter hair! I can see where im going now 😁
.
SmartyPence Tip 💡
Stay safe & save money by maintaining your locks at home! Truth is I have always trimmed my hair myself but this huge length is a daring first 😁 Even though Circuit Breaker will end soon, I really dont like the idea of heading to the hairstylist just yet, not to mention the crazy long Qs! Man in the house has also started shaving his own hair cuz its actually super easy? Esp with some practice which we can afford tons of now 🤣)
.
Going to finish this off with a dye job this weekend to celebrate the end of CB! Those awful roots! .
ps: Tilted my face in the top right pic for a flattering angle. Both sides are balanced for the record! Anyway, who will see right? 😁
