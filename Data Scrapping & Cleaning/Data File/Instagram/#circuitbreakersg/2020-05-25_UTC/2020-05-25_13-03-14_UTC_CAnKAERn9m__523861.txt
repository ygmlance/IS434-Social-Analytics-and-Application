Another first tonight! Herb crusted rack of lamb. Surprisingly easy and turned out so well! We also whipped up some guacamole and salmon tartare since we had some ripe avocados. #whenitrytofeedmyself #circuitbreakersg #circuitbreakersingapore #lambrack #herbcrustedlambrack #salmonavocadotartare #guacamole #sgfoodies
