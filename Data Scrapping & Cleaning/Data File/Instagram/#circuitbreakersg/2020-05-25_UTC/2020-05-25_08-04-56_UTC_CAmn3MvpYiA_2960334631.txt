Having fiber in our daily diet is very important towards having good digestive system which equals to overall good health 💖💖💖
.
.
There are 2 types of fiber -soluble & insoluble ... both are equally important but they have different functions to play in our body ....
⏺Soluble fiber - is fiber that attracts water & forms a gel .... this gel then causes slowing of the digestion process which can be beneficial towards weight loss ... foods like oats, legumes, nuts etc ...
⏺Insoluble fiber - this fiber repels water ... this fibers primary benefit is to provide bulk to stools & aid in movement thru the digestive tract ... foods like veggies, fruits, seeds, whole grains etc ....
.

Studies have shown that people who eat high fibrous food tend to have lower heart health issues, obesity, type 2 diabetes, high BP & digestive health issues ..... Every adult needs 25gms of fiber daily .....
