菜飯 which mum loves~ used to be so sick of it when i was young cos mum loves to cook it every so often and there was lots of veggies~ 😅 but because mum hasn’t been cooking since she started working many years ago, craved it sometimes~ this cb, craving definitely satisfied~ 😂 ps: finally managed to rem to take a pic before covering it all with chilli sauce~ 🤣 #singapore #singaporefood #foodphotography #circuitbreaker #homemadefood
