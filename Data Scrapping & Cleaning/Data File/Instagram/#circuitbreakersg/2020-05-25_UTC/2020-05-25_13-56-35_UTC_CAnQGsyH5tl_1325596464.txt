One for the road! .
.
Since we can’t go on a holiday anytime soon, we recreate holiday at home!
.
One of the vacations our family loves is a Club Med holiday. Whichever Club Med resort we go, we would attempt to try every Mocktail, Shake and Cocktail during our stay. No where else gives us such liberty to drink to our heart’s content 😁
.
So here it is, before my WFH ends and I return to regular work hours tomorrow, I capped it with an afternoon of mocktail making with the kids. Can you name the different mocktails we created?
.
Among them are:
Holiday Shirley
Virgin Mojito
Mango Frappe
Cranberry Cooler
Pineapple Orange 
And...
PINA COLADA!🍹
.
The Club Med website (Clubmed.com.sg )has tons of cool Club Med activities for families during this stay home period. If you’re running out of ideas to occupy the kids, give the Club Med Singapore website a visit. Meanwhile...Cheers! Salut!🍹
