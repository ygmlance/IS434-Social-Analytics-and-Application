New batch of yarns!!! ðŸ§¶
Thanks to @craftershub_craftershub for allowing exchange of the earlier purchased ones. These 5-ply yarns are much better suited for #amigurumi. Trying to complete at least one this month cos #amigurumay and long overdue since #stayhomenotice (2nd pic). Its prob best to start all over with the new yarns but I'm going to combine these with what's already done and see how it turns out...
And thanks for the 6mm eyes too ðŸ¥°
