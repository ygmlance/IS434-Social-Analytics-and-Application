The little boy used to throw the poor Flockmen around the house when he was younger. He loved to do that while his sisters were stacking them up and that caused them a lot of misery. ðŸ˜… Recently he seemed to have a newfound appreciation for the flock! We see him trying his best to stack them up, so far his record is just two. The third would usually drop off and it makes him really frustrated. ðŸ˜† He has also been counting Flockmen on his own and making them drop into his sensory tray. He adds that they are swimming which we found really amusing.

Glad to see him having fun and getting creative with Flockmen just like his sisters. Since we still can't head outdoors during this period of time and we are really unsure how long more this has to go on, it's great to have Flockmen to chase away the blues with open-ended play.
