Treating myself to @lees_confectionery exquisite cakes for the weekend🤩✨ now that I’m baking, i have a personal list of <never do it yourself> which also means <pay money for them>😂💕artisanal cakes is on the list✨ i got their latest #matcha addition: DALE 🍵 and their top favorite MADU 🍯 both exceeded my expectations! I love that both aren’t as sugary sweet and achieved the focus on the flavor of the key ingredient👍 their silent winner is their unique tart base😏✨ DALE’s matcha does hit the spot for a matcha lover’s craving for that deep rich bitter sweetness🍵✨ MADU is truly my sweet favorite: that honey joy base is perfect!👌 the sweetness from the honey is acceptable and addictive - I can finish 2 myself🤤 immediately LEE’S is on the top ranks of my favorite cake shops in Singapore but.... why is it so farrrrr (jurong helps)😭 all u lucky Jurong residents😣
