We made these marmite chicken drumsticks with an air fryer on Sunday (24/5)
The chicken legs were first seasoned with marmite, salt , pepper and sesame oil and then placed in fridge overnight . Air fried the chicken at 200deg C for 30 mins. Turned the chicken after 15 mins.

The result- we were all happy with the end product, chicken tender and juicy!! Yummy ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹
