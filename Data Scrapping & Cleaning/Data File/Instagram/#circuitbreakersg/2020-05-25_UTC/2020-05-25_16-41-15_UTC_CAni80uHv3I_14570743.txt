CovEid 2020. Came across these discarded barber stools, reflection of how many small businesses and barbershops that have been hit hard by the outbreak; or maybe a sign of them renovating, innovating and upgrading. Actually, I was just half tempted to bring one of those stools home, since my haircuts are now done by my own personal barber at home. #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
