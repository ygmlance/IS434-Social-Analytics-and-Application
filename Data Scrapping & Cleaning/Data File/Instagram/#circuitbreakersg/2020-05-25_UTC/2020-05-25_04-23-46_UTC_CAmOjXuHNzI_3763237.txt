❤️Snacking game strong with these Super crispy vegan-friendly beancurd skin snacks from @fupi.co ⁣
⁣
They are made from high quality soybeans and coated with amazing flavors such as hotpot tomato and Sichuan Mala. No preservatives added! I’m in love with the hotpot tomato flavor! It makes me feel like I’m enjoying the real deal in crisp form 💗💗 The Sichuan Mala one is rather spicy. If you’re a Mala lover, you’ll definitely like this!⁣

These snacks are for sale on @shopee_sg or @lazada_sg 👍🏻 Thank you @fupi.co for the yummies 😍⁣
