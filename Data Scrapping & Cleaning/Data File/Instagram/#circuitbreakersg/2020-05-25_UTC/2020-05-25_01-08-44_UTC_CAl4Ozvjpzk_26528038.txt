Wearing a lot of hats right now. ðŸŽ© .

Literally and metaphorically. The past ðŸ’¯ + days Iâ€™ve been a mom, teacher, cleaner, plumber, baker, entertainer, dj, photographer, model, videographer (albeit poorly and very novice), i.t. Technician, electrician, seamstress, doctor, crafter, gardener, at home spa therapist, gamer, fairy princess, mechanic, exterminator, master builder (LEGO fans, you know) and Lord knows what else. Trying to balance it all and keep all the balls in the air is not always graceful or possible but Iâ€™m doing my best. What new skills have you acquired during these past few months? .
