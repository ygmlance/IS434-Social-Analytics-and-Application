#Circuitbreakersg day 48

If you are not ok today? Thatâ€™s ok.
Your mind is as good as your mindset. 
If you donâ€™t get to eat what you like today? 
Thatâ€™s ok too. Itâ€™s only a CB. Not the end of the world. Letâ€™s take turns to eat each otherâ€™s favourite food & perhaps discover something that u might never try if not for the CB?

Dinner last night: ðŸ”º Macaroni soup in a 20 hour bone broth for more collagen! 
I added clams to create a different layer of flavor.
ðŸ”¹Note: ok, soup was on the stove for only 8 hours la... not my usual but still really yummy. Natural goodness. ~
