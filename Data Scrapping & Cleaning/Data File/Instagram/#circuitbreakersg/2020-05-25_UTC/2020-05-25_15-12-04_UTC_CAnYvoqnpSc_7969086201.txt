Today I helped my mummy to rub cream into all her bruises and wounds and also kissed them to make them heal better.

I love you mummy! ðŸ¥°

Repost from @natadescoco - This darling ginna æ²¡æœ‰ç™½ç–¼å¥¹ã€‚

When she unscrewed the jar of anti-itch cream we have been using for her mosquito bites, I was prepared to scold her until I saw that she had dabbed a generous amount onto the bruise on my knee and was trying to rub it in.

She then proceeded to use her index finger to rub the cream into every "wound" she could find on me (including my BCG bump, the moles on my arms and back, and even a random broken blood vessel on my thigh LOL), all the while muttering "pain pain.. pain pain.." When she was pleased she had gotten them all, she gripped my arm to get my attention, looked into my eyes and very seriously told me "pain pain" and kissed the two biggest "wounds" on my arm.

Why so cute lah?? ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
