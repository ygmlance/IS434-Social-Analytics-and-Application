Started the day early with a workout session.
.
Beginning (5 sets)
- 5/5 Wrist hold single arm push ups
- 5/5 Straight arm chest up with weights
- 10/10 Single arm KB swings
- 5/5/5 Squat lunge lunge
.
End (5 sets)
- 10x Sitting leg raisers
- 5/5/5 Wide, normal, diamond push ups
- 10x Stargazers (because @ytptofficial weekly challenge)
.
Thought this would be a short session but it took me longer. Working towards that proper single arm push up eventually.
.
I guess one of the motivations of keeping me going is building up strength to do more variation of exercises. 💪🏻
