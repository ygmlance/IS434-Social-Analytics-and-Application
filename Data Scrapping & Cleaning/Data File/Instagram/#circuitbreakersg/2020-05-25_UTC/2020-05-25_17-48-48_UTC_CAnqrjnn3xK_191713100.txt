Its May 20th, in number it’s written 5.20 which Pronounce the numbers 5-2-0, and in Chinese its (五二零wǔ èr líng). which sound very close to the words (我爱你 wǒ ài nǐ), I love you.

To have something fancy to feed the husband on this day. Had homemade Ciabatta to go with Shakshouka.

Second attempt at my ciabatta. Not as many holes as I hope to have,but it’s better than the first. And it definitely taste so delicious. Crispy on the outside and it’s so airy and light on the inside.

Running out of coriander and parsley, I sprinkled a handful of spring onions to create my very own “Asian Style” Shakshouka to go with this bread.

You can dip this delicious bread with olive oil or spread with homemade herb butter, truffle sauce, liver pâté. Homemade is all about happiness, passion, fun with of experiment and practices and lots of patience 🤣

Oh boy, now the husband is addicted to this bread and requesting for more.
Ciabatta game on! Shall experiment more on making this baby.
