Dry Beef Rendang. This ambitious attempt to create the quintessential Peranakan curry ended up quite well, for a first try; came a little too short of balancing the sweet and salty flavours, but hey, I enjoyed eating the dish, with tender beef after simmering in the aromatic rendang paste and coconut cream for more than an hour. It is arguably one of my favourite local flavours of this Island City 🇸🇬. 👌🏻 And to my Moslem friends, Selamat Hari Raya!!! #rendang #beefrendang #peranakan #nonya #nyonya #homecooked #homecookedmeal #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg
