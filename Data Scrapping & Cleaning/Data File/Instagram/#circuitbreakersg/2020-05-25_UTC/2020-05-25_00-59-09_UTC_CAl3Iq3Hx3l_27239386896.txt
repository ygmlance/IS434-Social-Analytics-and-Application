I love rainbow ðŸŒˆ stuff! I think ðŸŒˆ represents hope and happiness! Hence when rainbow colours collaborate in food, how to resist??? Putting food colouring aside, there are also ways to extract the colourings naturally. Like the most common colour of lilac blue, you can get the natural colour from butterfly pea.

Hence, dieting should not be a pain in your life although people say women tend to diet for their WHOLE LIFE!

Just enjoy the moment of life and I have earlier mentioned in my last post that moderate eating is the key!

Iâ€™m using #Susenjimofa not because of slimming but to detox the accumulated rubbish that I have clogged in my colons and just want to flush the unwanted out and have my body cleansed so that the rubbish cannot take up a fraction of my weight as well as I have more space for little pleasures of my life example BUBBLE TEA.
