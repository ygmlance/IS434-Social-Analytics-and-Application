But like what you mentioned, explain to the kids that you are currently busy and that you will play with them later (and make sure you really do), shower then with hugs and kisses. Have meals together. Talk to kids before zzz. .\nAll will be well \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc95\u2764\ufe0f",

I find that these work very well for us! In between meetings, I make a conscious effort to go to both T and H, and to give them hugs and kisses. I steal 5 mins here and there throughout the day to do these. Sometimes I use those minutes to talk to T about my work, so he feels involved.\u2063\n\u2063\n\ud83d\udd38 Make use of weekends to bond with your kids. Create valuable memories together - bake, create a fort, do a \u2018picnic\u2019! And don\u2019t forget, to take rest.
