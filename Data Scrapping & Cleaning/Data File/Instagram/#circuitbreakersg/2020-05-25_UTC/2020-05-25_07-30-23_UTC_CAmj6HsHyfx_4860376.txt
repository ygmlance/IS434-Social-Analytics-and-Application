Today’s 4-minute #breakfast: Take a @myojosingapore #malaxiangguo dry (as opposed to #soup) #ramen ... I was curious about this as I’d never tried it. Add the packet of dried mushrooms, fill it with hot water, let it sit for 3 minutes then open this tiny hole at the other side of the lid as marked, drain the water, then add the #Sichuan mala paste & seasonings, stir etc. I topped it off with my mother’s tofu braised in soy sauce & garlic etc... look at what a sponge for that rich earthy gravy those triangles became. Beautiful. Perfect quick meal. 👍👍 #colazione #latergram #noodles #cibocinese #chinesefood #sglife #singapore🇸🇬 #circuitbreaker #circuitbreakersg #cb #cblife
