🎥 My first livestream storytelling came and went... just like this long weekend! 🤪⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Shout out to @celine_tan @melodybay @belandbray for sharing with your friends... we had around 40+ children join in the story sharing 🧒🏻👶🏻👦🏻I could almost hear some of the camera-change countdowns from my home! 😍⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
For those who overslept, you can watch the rerun on my IGTV 😴😜📺⁠⠀

🎁I'm doing a giveaway as I know things have been a bit difficult lately and I want to send you a bit of sunshine! I’m picking one lucky viewer to win a set of soybean crayons which I bought from Crayon Castle in Taiwan PLUS a limited edition notebook by Jimmy Liao 🖍️🏰📒 I bought these from my last holiday in Taiwan ✈️🇹🇼🏖️⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
📩 To take part, email me at positiveleepeilin@gmail.com to subscribe to my newsletters and I’ll be picking a lucky viewer from there. Giveaway closes this Saturday and I'll announce the winner on Sunday, 31 May ☀️⁠⠀
