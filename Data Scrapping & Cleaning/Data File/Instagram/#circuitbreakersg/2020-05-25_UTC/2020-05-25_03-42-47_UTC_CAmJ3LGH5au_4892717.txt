First of all, I’d like to congratulate all of you mamas for surviving 49 days of the #circuitbreakersg!⁣
⁣
It ain’t easy as some if not most of us have been preparing all 3 meals for those at home! You’ve probably hit your quota for the first half of the year within these two months.⁣
⁣
With most of us being under phase 2 when it comes to returning back to office, i think we might need a bit more push. So here’s sharing a dish I recently cooked and many have asked. It’s really not tough. Just have to get all your ingredients together before hand an fry!⁣
