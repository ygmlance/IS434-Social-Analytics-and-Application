Story time!

I've noticed that in older HDB flats, residents hang their laundry perpendicular to the flat as the facade come with little holes made to place bamboo poles in that direction. True, it gets more exposed to wind and sun as opposed to placing them parallel against the facade in multiple layers. However it's actually incredibly dangerous.

I remember very vividly back when I was a child, I was alone at home when it started to pour. I ran to the back wanting to close the windows only to find laundry still hanging outside. "Better bring them in", I thought, as I always remember my parents doing so when it rains. 
It was my first time bringing in laundry and I wasn't tall enough, so I grabbed a stool and stood atop it. Still, I had to tiptoe. 
Now, the laundry hanging outside were bed sheets and I didnt think they would be so heavy. Still, I managed to grab the bamboo pole and remove it from the hole it was in. As I was hauling it in, a sudden gust of wind caught the bed sheets and dragged the pole along with me. 
I almost fell out of the window if not for grabbing on to the window grill. I was literally hanging on the ledge as the stool was kicked from under my feet.

After that episode, I was pretty badly shaken but I never told my parents or anyone about this. 
Since then, I've always been very reluctant to hang or bring in laundry at this window as it gives me major chills. ðŸ˜­

I'm so glad that HDB has acknowledged the danger in this design and now newer flats provide parallel laundry racks which may be installed within the flat or outside. 
Can't wait for my future house where I no longer have to hang clothes in this dangerous manner!
