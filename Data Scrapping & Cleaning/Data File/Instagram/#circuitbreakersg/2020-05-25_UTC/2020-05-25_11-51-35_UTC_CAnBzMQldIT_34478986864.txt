From Instagram right to the tummy! We had previously tried other #mexicanfood in Singapore, but only found out about @papistacossg via insta yesterday. I was immediately intrigued and decided to order their tacos (chicken and chorizo), chicken quesadilla, and steak burrito (not shown) for dinner tonight.

Wowww the food was amazing 😍😍😍 — I'm a picky eater and usually one or two ingredients don't go well with me, but tonight I gobbled down everything! I particularly enjoyed the chorizo tacos (spicy with a generous dollop of guacamole 🥑) as well as their incredibly cheesy quesadilla.

In addition we ordered a litre of their lime #margarita. It complemented the food really well and we had to try very hard not to finish it all 😂 Looks like our new go-to Mexican restaurant, and we'll definitely re-order in the future!

P.S. Other Mexican places we frequent or have tried before include Super/Lucha Loco, Chico Loco Spit Roast, Vatos Urban Tacos, Guzman. Nothing wrong with those, but I'm happy to have found this refreshing new option. Or I guess technically, #theyfoundus...😅 Ordered via oddle, though there are other options. See website for details.
