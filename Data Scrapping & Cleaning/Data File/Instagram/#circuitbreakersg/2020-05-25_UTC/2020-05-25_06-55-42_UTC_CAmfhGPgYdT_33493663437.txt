I love prawns for their naturally savour flavour but daunt the prep work. To make it work for a family you gotta remove all its sharp edges and devein so that itâ€™s easy to eat, yet not remove the shell because the shell and the head are the main source of its flavour. (Kind of like using bones in soup)

So thankfully hub decided to help me with the prep work today! Yay!
