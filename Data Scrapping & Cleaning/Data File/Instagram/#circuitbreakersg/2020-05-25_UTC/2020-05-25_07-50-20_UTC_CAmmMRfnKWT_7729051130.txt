This Circuit Breaker / stay-home period has really tested my patience as a parent. It is easier to practice positive parenting techniques when you don’t have to work 10 hours everyday WITH your children tottering around you all the time. During this period, I found myself wearing multiple hats (even more than usual). Suddenly, I’m a full time working mom, a full time stay home mom, and a teacher for T’s home-based learning. Imagine being on a work call, and your child bursts into the room shouting for you to play with him - sounds familiar?! All positive parenting techniques go out of the window. I have neither time nor patience nor mental capacity to react ‘positively’ at that point in time. I find that I had to modify my parenting style on work days, and below are some tips that I had gathered which I hoped would help you as well.⁣
⁣
🔸 Empathize with your child. Your mental load is huge, people get it. Everyone looks at you and goes “oh it’s tough to work and be at home with the child”. But everyone forgets about the child. Nobody looks at the child and says “oh you have to stay home all day and your parents can’t play with you? That’s tough.” But it IS tough for the child - it is a real emotional load. Your child is probably struggling to understand why his parents are home all day everyday and yet they are not able to spend time with him. So empathize with him, talk to him and recognize his emotions.⁣
⁣
🔸 Pre-empt your child with your actions. I know I’m likely going to behave in a non-ideal manner if T stomps into the room during my work call. So I pre-empt him. This is NOT a hall pass to scream at your kids or threaten your kids, but at least it readies the child for your reactions.⁣
⁣
🔸 Set aside (at least) 1 hour of quality bonding time everyday. Remember - all your child wants is your undivided attention! So set aside 1 hour of that for him everyday. No distractions, no work, no phones.⁣
