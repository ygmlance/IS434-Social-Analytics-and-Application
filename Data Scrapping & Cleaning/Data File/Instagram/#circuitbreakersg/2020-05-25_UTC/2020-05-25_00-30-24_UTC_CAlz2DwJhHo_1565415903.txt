This is the laziest beef stew I’ve ever made but it worked! 300g cubes brisket, 3 peeled and chopped carrots, one sliced onion and some chopped celery went straight into the crockpot without any pre-browning. Then boiling water went in to cover the meat and veg. Then 1 Knorr beef cube plus black pepper, 3 sprigs of thyme and 1 dried Bay leaf were mixed in. It went on High heat for 3 hours, then I mixed in 1 tbsp of Bisto powder plus some water and put it on High for another 2 hours. In The last 30 min I thickened the sauce with 1 tbsp each cornflour+water.  It was amazingly soft and flavourful. (I didn’t put in any tomato paste this time to see how it would taste - it was fine!) Served it with homemade sourdough crusty bread for a change from potatoes ✨
