Good news for cupcake lovers, there is a new cupcake specialist in Singapore!

The Good Cupcakes is a new company that sells delicious low calorie cupcakes.

Some of their bestsellers are the Boston Cream, Banoffee, Carrot and Walnut Cake, Earl Grey Lavender, and Raspberry Roses.

My favourite was the Earl Grey Lavender, which consists of a earl grey tea cake topped with gorgeously crafted lavender tea frostings.

It tugged at my heartstrings to eat this cupcake because it was so pretty!

The cupcake base was surprisingly moist and fluffy with a distinct earl grey tea aroma.

The slightly understated sweetness of the lavender frosting lent an elegant and refined taste.
