The circuit breaker has led me to find solace in my kitchen !! I had initially planned to cook the very simple Tomato Egg Drop Soup, but ended up adding in so many ingredients that my pot was almost overflowed.  The final product was my very own variation of Egg Drop Soup.  Felt really contented tucking into my bowl of comfort soup just the way I like it.  The wonderful thing about cooking at home is that you can improvise and adjust the ingredients to your liking, and it's very healthy too !! #eathealthy #imstayinghome #circuitbreakersg #sgcircuitbreaker #soup #souplover #soups #homecooking #homecook #homecooked #homecookedfood #icancook #homecookedmeal #ilovetocook #lovetocook #souptime #soupforthesoul #comfortfood
