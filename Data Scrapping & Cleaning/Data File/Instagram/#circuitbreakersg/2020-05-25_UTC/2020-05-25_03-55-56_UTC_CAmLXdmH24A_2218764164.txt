Delicious home-cooked food from mummy restaurant. Seriously so happy with my food, I think I might cut-down on eating redundant meals out when I am not food hunting. .

This is way better than Lau Pa Sat and all the random Basement food at Hong Leong building, I eat during lunch and dinners when I have no appointment.
