Our hearty homecooked Nasi Lemak lunch with a few Chicken Wing Rendang, peanuts, egg, Otah (Store-bought) and pan-fried Turmeric Saba. 🥰⁣
⁣
This is my first time using Saba for Nasi Lemak and it went superbly well with the coconut rice! It has a strong lovely flavour when pan-fried with just a little salt and Turmeric powder. We really enjoyed it very much and I think I'll use Saba instead of the usual Kuning or Kambong when I make Nasi Lemak again! Shiok!! 😋😋😋
