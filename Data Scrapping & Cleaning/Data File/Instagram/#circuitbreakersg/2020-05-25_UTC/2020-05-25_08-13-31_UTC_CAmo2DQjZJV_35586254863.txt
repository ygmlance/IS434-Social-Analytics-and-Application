Being proud of something isn’t the same as being a huge asshole and flexing it to everyone. We’re all humans after all. Doesn’t matter if you’re richer, more handsome or have a bigger dick, it’s no excuse to look down on others. Singaporeans are getting way more selfish lately (mostly boomers). Use your supposedly big brains to slow down and think instead of having knee-jerk reactions to something thanks.
