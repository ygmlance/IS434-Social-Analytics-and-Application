After moving from Hong Kong - where you can let your dog off the lead almost anywhere - we made a list of the different dog parks in SG that we could visit to give Chip a good run around 🐕

Enter #covid19 and #circuitbreakersg 😭 parks were closed and we’ve been stuck wandering around our neighbourhood for 6 weeks!

Yesterday on our usual stroll we happened across a path we’ve not been down before and it lead us to a huge, empty green field. It was right next to the beginnings of a construction site so I’m sure it won’t be this way forever but for now it can be our little space to run around 🌿
