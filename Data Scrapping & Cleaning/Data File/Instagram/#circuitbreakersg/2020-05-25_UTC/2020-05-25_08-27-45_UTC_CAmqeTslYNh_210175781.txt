8 days to "Safe Re-Opening".

Motivation Monday?
Muddle Monday?

Am a little out today... Snoozed the alarm this morning. Then dragged myself up - It's not easy to maintain discipline although it's been 39 days since I started my morning jogging routine. I was fighting internally - sleep vs continue this streak. After back and forth on why I should/shouldn't, I got up and began my routine in zombie mode.

Once I started running, I was no longer in zombie mode. Having this fixed routine helps me take out negative emotion of not wanting to do it. I feel it creates an anchor to build momentum. Also, keeping score helps - my personal streak / distance covered / heart rate maintained / speed /etc. It's exciting each time I see improvement.

On a positive note, starting later today allowed me to catch the sunrise and take some nice shots of the waterway. ðŸ˜Š
