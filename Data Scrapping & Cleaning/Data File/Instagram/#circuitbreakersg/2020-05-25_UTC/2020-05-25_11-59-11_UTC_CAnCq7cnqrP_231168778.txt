Day 49 of #stayhomesg #circuitbreakersg ***
I sewed a felt toy for boy-boy. I tried to make it look like boy-boy and I realised boy-boy looks kinda bearlike instead of catlike.

All the cats are happy to have a toy cat to play with except the smallest cat Kit Kat. Maybe itâ€™s because the toy is bigger!
