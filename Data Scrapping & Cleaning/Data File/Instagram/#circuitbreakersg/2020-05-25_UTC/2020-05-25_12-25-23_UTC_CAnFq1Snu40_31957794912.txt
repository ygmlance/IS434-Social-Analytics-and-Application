These make me so happy, you have no idea. #throwback to yesterdayâ€™s bake-a-storm with foccacia & pretzels. Pretzels were done in 3 flavors: sour cream onion, sesame garlic and cinnamon sugar. My love for Auntie Anneâ€™s pretzels is colossal. Miss them n though these r no auntie Anneâ€™s, they are still pretty damn good I must say.  Neighbours kids n the sis love them too so yay! Bonus: kitchen was redolent of freshly baked bread. ðŸ¥°#givingisliving #givingisreceiving. .
As an afterthought, I think I tend to cook or bake a storm every time Iâ€™ve completed an intense workout coupled with dance moves. Might be the adrenaline that went into overdrive. ðŸ˜°

Pretzels are absolutely delish & seemingly easy with no need for the yeast to rise unlike other breads. BUT the kneading is a pain the arse! So unless you have a lot of time to spare n patience which Iâ€™ve none of the latter, u might want to think twice. Bagels are much simpler n easier.
