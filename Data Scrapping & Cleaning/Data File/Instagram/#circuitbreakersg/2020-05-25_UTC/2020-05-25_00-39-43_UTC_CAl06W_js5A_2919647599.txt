Iâ€™ve been following more local content and trying out their recipes cause it has a little bit more heart and it ainâ€™t as whitewashed...Chef Sam from @luckyhouse_privatekitchen posts awesome easy tutorials on his YouTube for canto classics and this prawn omelette (har yan zin dan - thanks @sophiazhou for the canto assist) was so easy and so good. I obviously used Prawn Uncle black tigers to make it. Loaded it up in post with white pepper and more chilli sambal. SO, I really need your help FYN Homies - the best prawn omelette wins a lobster hor fun and a lotus chicken so imma gonna need your help to like this post. SEND FYN A LOBSTER HOR FUN CAUSE Iâ€™M IN DAY 49 OF CIRCUIT BREAKER ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ #luckyhouse_competition
