All nuts are packed with nutrients, but almonds stand out as a SUPER-NUT, providing 28 essential nutrients such as the natural antioxidant, vit E, good amount of fibre, heart friendly acids and so on.

As almonds contain phytochemicals that prevent our bodies from getting the full benefits when we digest them, activating them reduces phytates hence increasing the bioavailability of nutrient, making them gentler on your digestive system!

So much goodness to be had! Almond mlk is definitely worthy to be in your diet :)
