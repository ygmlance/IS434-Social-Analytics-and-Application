In a press conference on May 12, Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak said that this diversification is to help ensure that Singapore has sufficient capacity for testing now, and in the future. 
In the same press conference, Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned that more than 32,000 workers in dormitories have been tested, which is about 10% of the total number of workers in the dormitories to be tested.

It was announced previously that around 8,000 tests are now conducted daily.
