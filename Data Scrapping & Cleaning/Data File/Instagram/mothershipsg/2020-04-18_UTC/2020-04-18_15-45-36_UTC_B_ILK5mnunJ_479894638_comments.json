If the highly qualified so-called experts in WHO know how the immune system really works they won't recommend using disininfectants, hand sanitizers alcohol and soap. These toxic chemicals contain cancer causing agents like formaldehyde, Triclosan, sodium laurel sulphate, parabens, etc. that will impair the immune system and damage the organs!
