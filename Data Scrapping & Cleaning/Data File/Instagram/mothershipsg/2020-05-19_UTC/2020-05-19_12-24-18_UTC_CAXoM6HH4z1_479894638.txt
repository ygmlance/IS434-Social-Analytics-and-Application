After the CB ends on Jun. 1, up to 2 people from each household will be able to visit parents or grandparents staying elsewhere once a day, according to Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. However, seniors are advised not to leave their homes to visit family members.

He added that for seniors who have no children, exceptions will be made on appeal basis where their siblings or nieces and nephews can visit them.
