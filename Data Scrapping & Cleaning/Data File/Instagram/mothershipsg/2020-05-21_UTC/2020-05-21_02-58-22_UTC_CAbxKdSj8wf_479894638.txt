[STREAMED LIVE ON FACEBOOK] #MSCBTalks is a brand new live stream show where we invite guests to share and discuss on topics and issues during this period of Circuit Breaker.

Today, we speak to former actress and host, @sharonau13. In 2018, Sharon opened up publicly about her depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after experiencing the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Currently based in Paris, we check in with her on the situation there and how she has been coping during this global pandemic.

This was streamed live on Facebook on May 20, 2020, 9pm.
