Speaking at a press conference today (May 1), Minister Lawrence Wong urged everyone to remain vigilant and that it would be "premature for anyone, whether in Singapore, or anywhere in the world to assume that once we pass this particular wave, and say, in June, July, the world will be free from Covid-19 and life would be able to resume. No one can say that."
