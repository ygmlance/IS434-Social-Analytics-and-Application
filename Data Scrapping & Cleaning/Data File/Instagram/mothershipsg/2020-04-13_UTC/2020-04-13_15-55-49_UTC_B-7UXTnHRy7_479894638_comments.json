Since for the past 2 years brought up ths matter. Still the same. Till last week still 2/3 long heavy vehicle trucks came in at different timing to do inloading. Whn the truck lorries reverse the reverse beeping sound is louder thn my 6 am alarm clock. The foreign guys never wear mask at all including the driver that went down from the driver seat, 3 people (driver & 2 asstnt) all doing unloading of full loads of fruits from the heavy vehicle lorry while talking + loading ip empty baskets. Call the neighbourhood police but nvr come untill full loads being unloaded for 274 Bukit batok east ave 4. Seriously, if one of thm a carrier, their hands on the baskets, boxes etc while the owner of the fruit stall too kiasu to using a big space of the public void deck to display and do sales without sticking the space area of  leasing. Cut & wrap  the watermelons out door - outside from the stall. Unhygiene, virus at split second cld get into the fruits they are cutting and wrapping.",

The numbers are quickly escalating due to the living conditions in dormitories which the govt are rectifying at the moment.

When economy starts recessing and ppl start losing their jobs then y'all will complain. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
