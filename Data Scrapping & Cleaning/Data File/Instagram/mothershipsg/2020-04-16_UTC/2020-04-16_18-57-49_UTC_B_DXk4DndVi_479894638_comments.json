For a country as compact as Singapore, we should be seeing thousands at this point but that isnt the case. Look at the top few countries, they have very widespread population but still is transmitting at a faster rate than we are(some while under lockdown). The government have also said that the first 2 weeks will be crucial. The CB will flush out most of the clusters and infected. Dont forget that this virus takes about a week or 2 before developing symptoms in some cases and we are witnessing the evidence as more and more gets tested positive. For all we know, some of these could have been old cases that tested positive near the end of 2 weeks. The best we can do now is listen to the government and cooperate because who understands the situation better than they do? Stay up to date as well through reputable news sources. Its gonna be a long and tiring fight for our frontliners, dont be dead weights.",

They are even on social media when their age isnt even allowed here. Their parents should keep a close watchout for their kids. I believe that the use of vulgarity should not be directed at anyone.

So we say singapore don\u2019t have supply of masks, at one point in time during Feb, MP told us not to worry as we have enough supply of masks to be given for the whole of Singapore, and don\u2019t use if you\u2019re not sick. Now, you think about it, during this time as well, there was news coming from China that you may have the virus but not show any symptoms :), so how to know if you\u2019re sick or not, let\u2019s say you just cough once after talking so much and you think you\u2019re not sick but you actually have the virus, then your droplets will spread to surfaces and so on. Actions are not being taken preemptively but instead are taken pro actively where now they are trying to contain the spread instead of PREVENTING it to happen in the first place. Now SG give out a recyclable mask but I haven\u2019t seen anyone using them, I personally don\u2019t use it as it is very uncomfortable. Ive only seen most people using the surgical mask, that is so called limited and only for frontline workers. How can you say when there was a few cases in SG only, that the masks are focused on frontline workers when the virus is literally back stabbing you because you have no protection as gahmen said don\u2019t need to wear if not sick. Doesn\u2019t this give an even more false sense of security? Economy can rise again but people only live once. You see now healthcare workers are all suffering from all the pre CB measures in which it is advised not to use mask unless you\u2019re sick. Isn\u2019t it better for all to use mask to help each other? Why must wait for instructions? Gahmen say dont do this then dont do, gahmen say do this then do. ?????",

Everyone is encouraged to get themselves checked for a super affordable price and a very delicious MC of 5 days even for a cough. There are over 900 of these clinics as well so no excuse for people to say too crowded or cant find one. Government have also said that those who displays the symptoms of the virus should get themselves checked or refrain from going out. So really whose fault is it?  Those who are still coughing and sneezing without going to the doctors. I cant tell whose fault is it really. Singapore exports mask so we can maintain our reputation. The politics game require strategies like these. If we do not help, others do not help. We get a good return as well. By giving 1, we now receive 2. (Its an example of give and take). Those who dont abide by the 1m rule is at fault. Or is it the government fault again? Those who dont wear masks when they cough or sneeze, again whose fault is it? Those who dont wear a mask wherever they go during the CB period, whose fault is it? Now im not trying to lick our government's arse but the amount of crap the public have given them is too much. The amount of stress put on them right now is crazy now add on public criticising them because the public cant learn to listen. We didnt get to where we were if our government were not competent. (Talking about us reaching first world status in half a century) if anything, this is the time where we give our support to the government. They gave us an easy life and now the youths are taking things for granted. Even i am at fault, i take things for granted but i am trying to change for the better.",

Now, we do not have a mass mask production team and we had to rely on importing them before we have one running well. Those helping us with the masks needs it for themselves as well. The government havetold us to stay at home and go out if we have to. Adviced but not enforced. People took that for granted and continued going out enjoying life. Now whose fault is that? We arent giving as much cooperation as the government require us to do. Even when it is enforced, people are still not listening. A $300 fine isnt even enough to scare them. People with the virus and doesnt show symptoms are very unlikely to spread the virus. How do you spread the virus if you dont sneeze or cough right? The only way is to share something he/she have consumed, even then, the government have told us to minimize contact with one another. Knowing the virus is alive and about, everyone should understand the need to restrain themselves from having any bodily fluid contact with anyone but their family. I agree things could have been done differently but the government have done a lot to help us but we are not helping ourselves. You say you dont see the reusable masks being used? I saw many people using it in the malls the moment they started handing it out. I saw more people using reusable masks than the surgical ones. Whatever it is, the important thing now is people should be at home and only going out if needed. People have suddenly became healthy and going out to exercise.

No one wants to enter HK except their own people so they basically \"banned\" tourism and as you know, tourism is a major cause to most community spreads. They are also in a bad state which doesnt allow the government to do proper testing on them so for all we know, those numbers could be false or altered. And yes taiwan definitely did the best but i didnt claim that singapore was the best did i? We are also 11 times more compact as they are. A bigger country will be easier to contain the virus than a tight country like singapore. Comparing Singapore to taiwan would be a mismatch. Comparing HK and Singapore would be a better comparison if only they werent in that position. Taiwan did a good job and they praised us as well so i think it is valid to say the measures our government have taken is solid but not our cooperation with the government. So if we were to push the blame to anyone, it would be to those inconsiderate individuals in singapore.",
