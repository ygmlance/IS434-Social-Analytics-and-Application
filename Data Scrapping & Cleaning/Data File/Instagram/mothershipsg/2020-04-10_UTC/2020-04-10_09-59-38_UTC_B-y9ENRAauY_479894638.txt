"If any of their family members watch my video, let me say this to them: 'We appreciate the work and contributions of your sons, fathers, husbands in Singapore.' We feel responsible for their well-being. We will do our best to take care of their health, livelihood and welfare here, and to let them go home, safe and sound, to you. On behalf of all Singaporeans, I wish you well." (Video: PMO)
