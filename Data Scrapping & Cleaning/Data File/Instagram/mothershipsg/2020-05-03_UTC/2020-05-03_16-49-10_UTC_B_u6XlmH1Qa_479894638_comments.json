There were couple of cases of students having the virus . Remember its not if but when student to student transmission would happen . But also lockdown will destroy the economy . I feel like if they want to do a circuit breaker then go all out and shut down non essential bussinesses immediately such as bubble tea shop , small food chains like fine dining , it btr to have a quick and painful lockdown than a slow and never ending lockdown .",

Overcrowded migrant worker dormitories. Because there are 8-15 people sharing 1 room the infection spread like wildfires in these dorms & since sg has over 300k workers living in these dorms there are surely going to be many cases. However, with 8k tests conducted in a day and keeping in mind the backlog, the numbers are hardly 10% of the daily tests so measures put in place are working. Also there was no \u201carrogance\u201d or \u201cignorance\u201d after 27 Jan, Singapore had the most number of cases after China, however, despite the density of the city, we went down to beyond number 50. So a lot of things were obviously done right. However, there was a underlying social problem that lead to a massive outbreak. Had the Govt been more vigilant about this group of people can such high numbers be avoided? Yes. However, if the lockdown was introduced in earlier stages can the high number be avoided? Absolutely not. Because 1 infected person will be stuck in a dorm with thousands of other workers & that would spike the cases in the very early stages of the pandemic when sg was still gather resources for the healthcare sector. Had that happened, we would had more deaths as our healthcare system would had been overwhelmed. Now over 1k are in Hospitals while the 10k are in community isolation facilities. Although stretched thin, not overburdened. In the end everything happens for a reason, no Govt has experience in dealing with covid, but they are doing their best n we as residents of the city must cooperate.",
