Symptoms can include:increase in mucus production, change in mucus, color, fever, chills, increased cough, allergic reaction, blurred vision, breathing difficulty, cold symptoms, anxiety, depression, dry mouth, fatigue, indigestion, diarrhea, irregular heartbeat, mood swings, irritability, muscle cramping, rapid heartbeat, sexual dysfunction, increased sensitivity to light, nausea, difficulty in urinating, feeling of anger, constipation, hand and leg cramping, skin rash, sore throat, hallucinations, abnormal dream, nervousness and reduced libido. It is pure stupidity to pay repeatedly to get so many health problems! I hate to disappoint you.I was exposed to my neighbour's carcinogenic incense daily (1 level below my unit), my left neighbour died from cancer, her son and my right neighbour were diagnosed with cancer but I was unscathed except for the life-threatening severe allergic reaction which my excellent immune system always reversed all the symptoms without any medication! You either understand how the immune system works or don't understand and be killed! The vulnerabile people to COVID 19 are those with preexisting conditions who are taking the toxic medicines. Your own prescription already give you irregular heartbeat and rapid heartbeat, increase your chance of pneumonia, etc. When the doctor prescribes HiV medicine to treat COVID 19, the increased acids in the blood can be fatal, liver failure, pancreas failure, heart problems and other adverse reactions can cause your death. This is how the Americans who are great believers of medicines and vaccines die ! You just let me prove to the world how stupid it is to believe medicine can save you from dying! Frankly, if you read other prescriptions the side effects are quite similar with minor differences! All medicines will impair the immune system leaving their victims vulnerable to infections and diseases! Jessica Seah reversed all her health problems without any medication or exercise. Both are highly recommended by the clueless scientists and Dr Jekylls! To err is human; to err repeatedly is inhuman. \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec",

The cancer causing agents like formaldehyde, Triclosan, sodium laurel sulphate, parabens, etc, only weaken the immune system leaving the population more vulnerable to COVID 19.

Inside subways, especially places like Tokyo, people are packed like sardines inside trains and also there are people(like you) that don't put on mask. Not all Japanese are as considerate as you  think. For nurses and doctors, accidents happens. Sometimes they may accidentally contaminate a surface that a lot of people touch and when their protection are off, they can accidentally contaminate themselves. Doctors a nurses are human they make mistakes. Another possibility is that they didn't get infected when they are in those suit. They can get infected elsewhere such as in public transport. If those protection doesn't work, a crap load more doctors and nurses will get infected. If you didn't realise, the amount of nurses and doctors getting infected (in SG) are not that much. Why didn't you fall sick when someone cough badly at your face? 1: you are a asymptomatic carrier. 2: not covid but a normal cold or smt and it's not a 100% chance for you to get infected plus you got lucky. 3. Choke. WHO may give recommendations but guess what? Not all countries would follow the recommendations, not all people would follow the recommendations. Why? It's a recommendation not a law. People are not forced to do it why should they do it? You see the problem here?!",

I do not poison myself with the wrong consumption because I did everything mentioned in the book Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. Therefore, without impairing my immune system and damaging the organs, it is impossible for viruses or bacteria to succeed because my immune system will fight and subdue the viruses, etc and the organs will purge out the invaders. For people on medications, the medications will disrupt the organ functions. For instance antihistamines will reduce the body's natural production of histamine that cause the rashes, the rashes are healed but the carcinogen for instance , my neighbor's carcinogenic incense still remain in my body to poison my immune system and damage all the organs and blood. Our immune system depends on the symptoms to fight the pathogen but medicine removed those signals like cough, mucus, phlegm, rashes, lumps, pain, breathlessness, etc.Therefore,  the result for those who rely on medicines , the viruses will remain in the body to impair the immune and damage the organs. Hence, they can infect other people. For me, my immune system could fight and subdue the viruses, the organs will flush out the viruses out automatically, therefore my test result will be always negative. My body is always ready to attack the next invader at all times! I won't infect other people if I don't have the viruses in me. If I have I will be sick. When you don't poison the body, the immune system and the organs work optimally to protect you. I urge the leaders all over the world to contact Jessica Seah from Singapore at aceofaceent@yahoo.com if they want to stop this unprecdented global pandemic swiftly without using the expensive ventilators. Jessica Seah's nontoxic method is cheap, simple and very effective. It costs less than US$25 to reverse the H1N1 infection of a grandma and her 3 years old grandson!

With the exception of people born with birth defects, everybody's immune system and organs work the same way but through wrong consumption, poor habits like smoking, religious beliefs like incense burning, wrong treatment methods, unhealthy lifestyle, misinformation, man-made chemicals, etc. the efficiency of the immune system and the organs will differ. When you really understand how the body works you have zero medical treatment bill. When you don't, you will spend endlessly to get repeat prescriptions!It is always the wrong treatment methods that kill.

Americans are great believers of medicines and vaccines. They daily prescriptions already impair their immune system making them more vulnerable to COVID 19, infections and diseases. Therefore it is not surprising their infection rate and death rate are the highest! WHO's  recommendation of using disininfectants, hand sanitizers, alcohol and frequent washing of hands with soap with cancer causing agents like formaldehyde Triclosan sodium laurel sulphate parabens etc further weaken the immune system of the entire population! I am stating facts unlike the clueless scientists who blamed the Chinese for eating bats! Viral and bacterial mutations are triggered by chemicals like medicines , vaccines disinfectants. Antiobiotics can only kill the bacteria but not the viruses. The viruses will mutate into new strains like SARS MERS H1N1 H5N1 and now COVID 19, understand? If the foolish scientists continue to develop vaccine for COVID 19 then the world will continue to have more catastrophes! To err is human; to err repeatedly is inhuman!\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec",
