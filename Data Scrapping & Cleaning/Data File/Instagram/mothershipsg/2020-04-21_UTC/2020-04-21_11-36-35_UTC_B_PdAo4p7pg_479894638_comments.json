FW in the dorms are the most vulnerable population when it comes to this virus. Yes some of them may  not be equipped with knowledge of the virus. However, most dorms more ill equipped with basic necessities like space  and a working toilet. The government must have known that. Aggressive testing in the dorms were only done recently as shown in our numbers. They were an after thought. Even in the media. They will report 2 numbers. One for Singapore population one for FW population as though to appease us and telling us not to worry. This shows that the yes the CB measures are working for us. But it is definitely not working for FW in the dorms. This was definitely a delayed response on our Govt's part because at that point when the 1st FW was tested positive, action should have been taken. It would have of course cost the Govt a lot to start rigorous testing and moving FW who tested positive out. But Guess what? We are still paying for it now. So yes it is about cost. Credit where credit is due. Yes our government is doing an incredible job dealing with this crisis. I'm not condemning their inaction. I'm just stating that there is a DELAYED action.",

Come to think of it, yes, we should spare a thought for these foreign workers but note that as much as the gvt can try their very best to treat both citizens n FWs equally well, there\u2019ll always be one end that lose out. It\u2019s impossible to maintain the same amount of care for both locals and FWs. That being said, i think we should be really grateful for we citizens are the ones being taken care to a greater extent of, with no delayed measures. After all, if things were otherwise and FWs were properly taken care of in priority of us, the situation in Singapore wld be much worse with many voicing out all their defences as to how they as citizens aren\u2019t prioritised, right? Hence i feel that we shouldn\u2019t really dwell on what the gvt did not manage to do in time but look at what has been done in preparation for the worst.

How to afford to suddenly distribute the FWs around singapore such that they have sufficient space to social distance themselves? They are already housed there all together because we do have enough facilities for them to space out because already so many areas are converted for covid-19 recovering as well as mild patients to stay. That was why when there was no need to start the dispersal of them, the gvt did not take action. Until it showed that there were clusters and the area was alr contaminated that now the gvt is stepping up its measures. Understand that from their point of view, we\u2019re alr maxing out the areas we have for this purposes. For singaporeans however, most of us have a place/house to stay because we invested; well that doesn\u2019t mean that FWs are being put last. It is just so that in a country like us, we have too little land for equal distribution of flats etc and do you think FWs want to invest in a house to stay at just to social distant themselves?",

While in china, they are relying much on their own local people who have their homes (and the price of land there isnt as expensive as spore, so they can havr their ownnhouse rather than staying in dorms) to run their economy. This cant be compared to singapore who also rely much on their foreign workers to sustain the economy competitiveness.

But that's because you weren't in the position of needing to travel, nor were u having financial needs like the migrant workers. Furthermore if they had locked down, it would have been destructive to the economy. Also mind you, government were not the ones fully responsible for this virus, if only everyone did wash their hands properly, if only people didn't necessarily go to clubs etc, these workers might not even get infected in the first place. The government isn't pushing the blame at you, that's the reason why you're not part of them, it's not their money to spend, it's not being selfish, it's being smart where you spend national resources.",

Otherwise, they can be housed in not - in- operation rental flats (Dakota, ) which have no occupants, and sufficient facilities. Locking them all up in a room at THIS POINT IN TIME is a farce. I hope my IDEAL PLANS and EXAMPLES are sufficient, pleb. To u, China may be a disproportionate comparison, but Singapore and China have comparable technology and reliant on cheap labour. In Singapore\u2019s case- cheap labour comes from migrants, in China\u2019s case- cheap labour is supplied from within their own country. Do note that when the lockdown in China started, they did not allow movement across the country, and it was purported that existing cheap labour are housed in FLATS that have been built (since SARS as China has prepared for this). Did Singapore have a contingency plan? So.. just because there are limitations, the government concedes and decides to let the numbers grow exponentially? Should we allow the cases within the migrant\u2019s group to hit 200,000?",

I am not even saying that the government is doing the right thing, what I am saying is it's very easy to point fingers and push the blame when we ourselves don't know better.

HOWEVER, social distancing measures were not implemented at the earlier stages- the workers are still packed like sardines in each dormitory. Is it not common sensical that transmission will be prevalent especially in dorms? The key question is WHY WERE THEY NOT SEGREGATED PROPERLY. It stems from systemic ignorance from our government- failing to acknowledge the severity of the issue, failing to implement proper social distancing from the beginning AT A STATE LEVEL. well, u can argue that nobody thought covid-19 would be transmitted around the dorms, but as the ministry of manpower , it is essential to have foresight and have adequate preparation in the event it happens. Time and time again we are taught \u201cnot what if, but WHEN\u201d - well INSUFFICIENT measures were implemented. parallel to CHINA, they have done vigorous social distancing for all workers who reside in dorms, ever since sars, they built spare apartments in the event a virus outbreak occurs. Although we have lack of land, we surely can utilise on our existing facilities. As a \u201cfirst world country\u201d, we can do more.

                "text": "@venus.txy absolutely not discrediting the important work that migrant workers do in Singapore, however, it is important to think about why the singaporean society is so dependent on migrant workers. The answer is always Singaporean\u2019s aren\u2019t willing to do it because it\u2019s tough blue collar work and we are too privileged to do so. But if that\u2019s the case, why have other first world countries like Scandinavian states and Australia been able to have local workers doing blue collar work (like sanitation and construction) but we haven\u2019t in Singapore? Perhaps the wage structure for blue collar work in Singapore has to change. Migrant workers earn low wages in Singapore, but the exchange rates make it feasible for them to make a living in Singapore and send money home. It is extremely difficult for a Singaporean to earn the current blue collar wages and make a living and feed a family in Singapore",

There happen to be a supply of such foreign workers at that given price point in which Singapore is offering. Cost would just become a secondary benefit to the govt and to MOM. Do you think that if suddenly all borders were closed and we CANT hire foreign workers, the govt would just be like \u201cfuck it guess we can\u2019t have anymore labour intensive jobs in singapore\u201d? Obv not, but that\u2019s just how society grows as a whole, through specialisation where people do the jobs in which they are skilled at to increase efficiency as a whole",
