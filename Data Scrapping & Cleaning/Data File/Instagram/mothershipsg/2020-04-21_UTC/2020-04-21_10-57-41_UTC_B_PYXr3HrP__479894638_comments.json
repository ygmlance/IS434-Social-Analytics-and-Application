Insulting ones upbringing , mental state of health , ones family yet complain @ the same time when someone calls u a boomer?( maybe go search what the meaning of boomer is ) . To be very honest , what I see here are students perfectly capable of analytical and critical skills outright debating you with logical facts and arguments and all you can say is that they all have improper upbringings and make claims that are purely unjustified?",

The general population of students in Singapore face stress , and when that happens stop blaming the students for their failure of handling stress cos this entire system has \u201cgroomed\u201d them to be like that . What you need to understand is that as much as one needs to learn how to handle stress , if so many students have to handle that amount of stress , then isn\u2019t that an indication that there\u2019s smth wrong with the way society thinks and how the system is imposed on students ? Once again , I\u2019m going to emphasise that especially in Singapore , if so many students feel stress , our society still deems lowering to a lower standard as bad so naturally no one would want to ( that can\u2019t even be debated by u okay ) . And just for the sake of saying this , you\u2019re upset that \u201cinsulting you\u201d but In just as smth as simple as the comment I\u2019m replying to , you can say \u201c I\u2019m sorry your parents didn\u2019t teach you how to handle stress\u201d , and \u201c you light me one of them that isn\u2019t cut out to do well academically \u201c , so don\u2019t go around saying people are trying to insult you when you\u2019re clearly stooping to an even lower level",

It\u2019s actually really common to see that . In my school , after the Sec 3 promotional exams , many are offered the choice of dropping to normal academic or retain and many parents would come to school begging the Teachers for a second chance , so that kinda shows that it\u2019s not as easy to \u201c drop a stream\u201d because of various factors these parents , Teachers and students consider",

You\u2019re constantly deviating away from the points I\u2019m rebutting against you and at the end of the day you can say that I have poor upbringing . I think you\u2019re completely misunderstanding my views . Our education is harder than it was 20 years ago , and that isn\u2019t even just my opinion , it\u2019s a fact that can be verified if you 1. Look at our syllabus content 2. Search . Secondly , my so called \u201cview\u201d that the stress levels of students are extremely high the last few years , can be backed by evidence too . For the last time , I\u2019d repeat . We have a competitive education system ( has its pros and cons ) but cons wise , when people fight for the same grade and the same place , naturally people will feel pressured and stressed to perform even better ( this isn\u2019t even just a family thing ) , it\u2019s how our society works . Good education = high-paying job , that\u2019s the way our society thinks . It\u2019s a matter of principle? Yes , except the fact that the points made by everyone rebutting you is based on principles that you don\u2019t assume people don\u2019t work hard and that people aren\u2019t academically inclined . At this point , I hope you realise I\u2019m not speaking on my part , but merely reflecting what the average students goes through every single day . This entire vicious cycle . I\u2019m not saying our education system should be done away with , I\u2019m just saying that 1. Stress levels among students have been high because of a a competitive system and 2. There\u2019s obviously a stigma that dropping a stream or going to ite is the last resort and should be avoided . I don\u2019t think that way but naturally this is the case in our society",

I agree that one can drop streams if they cant cope, but we have to look at facts first. How many people actually can make it in life with a decent paying job without graduating with a degree or a diploma from poly? Honestly, I think you're the one living a lie, thinking that the education system is perfect or whatever. It isn't because it causes a stigma around dropping steams etc. I'm from a neighborhood sch and some teachers are say, \"Y'all better work hard or later end up in ite.\" What does that imply? What kind of education is that? I'm pretty sure that my sch or my teacher isnt the only one saying this sort of remarks. This kind of 'threats' by a teacher to encourage students to do well is supporting a stigma around ite etc. So to say that the stigma is not stuck is wrong. I'll admit some of us would find it silly eventually, but not all, because the stigma stays (teachers teach students this, students grow up using this, as students are impressionable and are taught to listen to teachers etc)",

What I\u2019m saying is that your argument that \u201cour education is easier than it was years ago\u201d is completely wrong",
