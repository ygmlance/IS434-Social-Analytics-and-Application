A critically endangered Hawksbill turtle laid its eggs at East Coast Park today (May 23). It is one of two species of marine turtles that can be found on Singapore's shores, and it may visit the same site to nest every few years.

Hawksbill turtles have a lifespan of 30 to 50 yearsâ€”however their survival rate is extremely low, and only one in a thousand hatchlings make it to adulthood.
