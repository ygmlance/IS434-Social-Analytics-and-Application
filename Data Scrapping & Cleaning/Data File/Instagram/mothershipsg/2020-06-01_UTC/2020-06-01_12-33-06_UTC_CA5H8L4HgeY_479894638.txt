From Jun. 2, face shield will only be allowed for certain groups of people. For the rest, wearing a face shield will be taken as not wearing a mask, and you can be penalised.

Face shields were allowed to be worn in place of face masks during the circuit breaker. However, masks will now be required as the default as more activities and close contact amongst people is expected as the CB lifts.
