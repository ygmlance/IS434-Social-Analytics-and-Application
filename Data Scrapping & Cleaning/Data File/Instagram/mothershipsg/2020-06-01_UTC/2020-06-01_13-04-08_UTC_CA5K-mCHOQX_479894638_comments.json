For example, limiting the no. of FWs in each room would definitely entail a greater no. of rooms. How else would operators be able to cater to all? That's just an example of the expenses that would incur by implementing solutions. \nNext, as much as financial & non-financial support schemes launched by statutory boards such as Enterprise SG(ESG) seek to aid operators and FWs, there's always an issue with self-entitled Singaporeans crying and whining about what a big deal their paid taxes are and conveniently forgetting that there are firms like GIC boosting our national reserves with the work they do. \nIn summary, gahmen can lend support and help. But when they do, Singaporeans kpkb non-stop about their taxes paid, thinking that our national reserves consist of only their measly taxes. So in a democratic society like this, how to help? More often than not, we as Singaporeans need to take a step back and reflect on ourselves instead of being selfish and entitled. \nBut at least, you're providing a solution instead of whining and bashing the gahmen for every right and wrong they do unlike most Singaporeans.",
