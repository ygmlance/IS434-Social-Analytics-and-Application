In response to Mothership's queries, an Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) spokesperson said that the agency is aware of the online posts and articles of people congregating around restaurants in Robertson Quay.

URA said that majority of operators and individuals complied with safe distancing measures during their safe distancing patrol in that area.

The agency has also issued a written direction to cease the sale of takeaway alcohols at some restaurants as that has contributed to people gathering in the area. #linkinbio
