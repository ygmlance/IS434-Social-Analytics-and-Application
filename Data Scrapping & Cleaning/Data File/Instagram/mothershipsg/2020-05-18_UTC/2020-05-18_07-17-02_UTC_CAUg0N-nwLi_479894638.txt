[JUST IN] The total number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore is now 28,343.

MOH added: â€œThe lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests being processed as one testing laboratory is reviewing its processes following an earlier apparatus calibration issue, and will need time to ramp up its testing capacity." #linkinbio
