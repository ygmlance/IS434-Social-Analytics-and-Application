What you are proposing is for the government to isolate the virus itself which is impossible. What they're doing now is literally containing the virus... Wait... Do you think those untested dorm workers are able to walk outside freely or are still working??? No! All the dorm workers are isolated in their own rooms... How is that gonna damage our economy? If you're gonna out them in hotels, the government will need to book hotels everywhere on the island because 5 hotels aren't enough. Furthermore even if the virus dies out, all the hotels need cleaning and followed by 28 days closure for safe measures. How's that effective for the economy? Are you confused between economy and community because right now the dorm workers won't be able to pass the virus to the community. So in no way will this protoco hurt our economy.",
