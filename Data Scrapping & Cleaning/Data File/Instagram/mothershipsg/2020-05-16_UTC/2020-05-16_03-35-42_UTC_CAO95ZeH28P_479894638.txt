JUST IN: The ministry further noted that the Medical Review Committee has deliberated on each of these cases individually and that these 18 cases were "clinically very well" but "persistently" tested positive for Covid-19.

As an added precaution, MOH noted that these patients are required to be home quarantined for a further seven days. 
One of these discharged cases reached out to Mothership to share their experience. #linkinbio
