        "text": "Earlier on in December 2019, some of my dad's Christian friends strongly encouraged them to attend church services, in particularly the Christmas celebrations. My parents weren't suspicious but they did gave our home address to the group. From what I heard, it wasn't an official church building but more like an office room in a huge building with all other businesses running and all. There were worse things to come. Since they knew our address, they came and harassed my mother. Firstly, they came to our house, despite my protests, baptized (or what Christians call purification) my parents and call for \"God\" 's blessings. Secondly, after that day, whenever they came, they brought more people with them and stayed longer outside our door, eventually demanded my mother to give out Christian brochures for them. When my mother claimed that she's not Christian and not willing to be any part of them anymore(only my father is willing to do anything to get free stuff they give out during services or sessions, whatever), they shouted and claimed that my mother \"looked down on them\". It has been many months since then, but even till now, in this Virus situation, those same Christian friends(who proclaimed to us they are not Christians) are still asking(or more like pleading) my father to go for their whatever church services. We are Buddhists, not Christians. I do not know if it's online or offline, but I do not agree that a religion should demand anyone to belong to them. Keyword, belong. Can I just ask, if people do not want us to spread and preach our religion, forcing people to listen to and obey us, isn't it fair that they do not do so to us too?",

Same for Gautama buddha when he and his followers(humans called them his disciples but he never seen it so) went around ancient India and Nepal region to preach on Buddhism. However, for those who don't accept Gautama's teachings(rarely so), he won't have pestered them like those pastors, my mother tongue teacher and many other Christian and Muslim classmates did to me. When I asked people why would they choose me to preach on their monotheistic religions, I always (keyword: always) get answers like \"oh you seem more keen to listen\" or \"oh you seem graceful and soft\". Yes I am to present myself as elegant(my goal as well\ud83d\ude05) but I would never accept anyone to badmouth my knowledge (you humans call this belief). One important thing is, you need to know that those pastors and those with monotheistic faiths in my social circles never just simply spread their religion to me. When I respect them enough to not snapped back immediately, they don't accept my refusal to continue listen. That, is truly my experience with monotheistic religions. While I did not declare myself as a religion teacher and seemingly taken a gentle demeanor, I won't take a soft approach to people who forcefully want other humans to obey and listen. This, is a promise made to myself and a mantra(mindset) personally.",

Twice was at west area MRT, and once was at Plaza Singapura.\nThe one at west area MRT, refer to the church/cult in Hillview (i won't say the cult name). Those persons -who were interviewing me- were ard 16yo, claimed to ask me help to do survey for their study. The ones in Plaza Sing were more mature, but were from different church. They started to asked me about Christianity n Bible study, since we're same Christian, sure i liked to talk to them. They were very sweet n tried to get into my personal life, but seems like they were very radical, didnt know about outside world. Since im a Roman Catholic for more than 20yrs, so i questioned them back. When i said that im a Catholic, they seemed like didnt know what Catholic was!! When i asked them whether they know abt other denominations, like Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, they seemed like just heard for first time.. I don't mean to judge, but seemed like their universal knowledge was very weak. The one in west, even alr told me that i have to be baptized in their church to become member of their church! First time meeting leh, they alr asked me to be baptized :O!!\nI said to them: I have been baptized, and I only confess one baptism, and i believe in one holy Catholic church. Then, she just didnt understand n urged me to join hers, n didnt want to let me go. So i gave them my contacts so then they could release me.\nThe one in Plaza Sing, they let me go cos i had to go my Cathedral, so they couldn't tahan me.\nNote to you all, be faithful in your own faith, so you will not get distracted by cults! God bless you!\ud83d\ude07",

Also a christian bro going ard west gate finding opponents from the non christian communities to debate. Sometime the christians have so much freedom of preaching and propagating their religion in public. We live in harmonious society why should we deem our fellow Singaporeans as infidel?",
