"It's tough to be cut off and be in a room most of the time, but they understand. Their main request is that after this is over they will be allowed to continue to work in Singapore," said Minister K Shanmugam during a visit to Westlite Papan dormitory on Apr. 22. 
The minister was there to address the concerns of foreign workers amidst the rising number of confirmed cases found in dormitories.
