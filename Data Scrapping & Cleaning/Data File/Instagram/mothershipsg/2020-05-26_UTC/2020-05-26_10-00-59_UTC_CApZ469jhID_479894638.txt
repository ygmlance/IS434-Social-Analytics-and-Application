This is to accelerate the push for more businesses to go digital.

Stallholders in hawker centres, wet markets, and industrial canteens will be given $300 per month, over the next 5 months, to encourage the switch to e-payment.

A Digital Resilience Bonus is also available for eligible businesses, where they can receive a payout of up to $5,000 if they adopt PayNow Corporate and e-invoicing as well as business process or e-commerce solutions.
