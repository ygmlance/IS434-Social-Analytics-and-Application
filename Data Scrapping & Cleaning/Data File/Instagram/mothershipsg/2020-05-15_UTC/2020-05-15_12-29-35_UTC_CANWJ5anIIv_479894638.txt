For the past 5 days, Singapore has had only single-digit community cases. At a press conference on 15 May, Minister Gan Kim Yong attributed the low count to circuit breaker measures, but also said an increase in cases was likely as more people go back to work. 
He added that there will be a focus on quarantine and contact tracing efforts to reduce the risk of large clusters forming again.
