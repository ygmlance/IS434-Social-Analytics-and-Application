This cost is ultimately passed to consumers. Obviously they have not done much, resulting in current situation, Now after waiving 2 mths of FW levy collection, they suddenly became \"protector of FWs\", at the expense of their employers and tax payers... some accountability from govt to all Singaporeans will be helpful to prevent the same from recurring.

That's more than 1MP per square km of land and they are paid the best salaries in the world. Should we accept poor or average results?  Why tell us that we prepared since SARS? They have the resources and intelligence of the country to tackle the problem with foresight and not issue reactive measures. But instead they made fancy videos early on showing how they contained the virus etc... Why try to milk everything to their favour? Why stop fw from being sent to hospitals for testing in Feb?  Many questions are left unanswered, can't blame the sharp thinkers from feeling frustrated right",

                "text": "@sinkietemplatelife Love this conversation bro. I feel that because sg heavily relies on foreign investors and economy for sustainability. The salary does limit  the corruption because of how small we are. It\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019m so rich, I don\u2019t need anything else\u201d vs \u201cI\u2019m paid lesser than a CEO but I have so much power so why not I...\u201d It won\u2019t work in other big countries because they have natural resources. So then the qn of \u201cwhy can\u2019t we have MPs that have good heart?\u201d I would love it. But for now, if can eliminate money as a factor for corruption, I would. \nWe won\u2019t know the limitations of their resources. Real numbers will scare the public. The govt is trying to assure us. It\u2019s more than just physical battle, it\u2019s also psychological. I think in Feb it was pretty early? Like mostly contained, no research of asymptomatic, no FW case (or was it 1?). Too much of everything will breakdown the systems - healthcare etc. At least they were prepared for army camps, expos, offshore stays, chalets etc. I think it\u2019s really commendable compared to other countries already. Their immediate lockdown just \u201ckilled\u201d everyone. It\u2019s effective to a certain extent. But our economy will really suffer. So many businesses are bankrupt (not reported in news). So I guess that\u2019s why they chose to do it in layers.",

                "text": "@sinkietemplatelife You are right. I apologise that I might have misled your thoughts. I\u2019m referring to the attitude and heart behind the people who probed. The doctors and watch groups did recommend, but I dunno if the NMPs did extensively (gotta research). PM Lee did explain why there was a u-turn in mask wearing: WHO\u2019s stand, asymptotic discovery etc. Moreover sg doesn\u2019t have mask wearing culture like HK. And the influx of measures will induce fear into people, which is way scarier than the virus. We saw hoarding in supermarkets already earlier this season. This virus is new, and doctors are finding out new things everyday. Sg govt had to make a decision swiftly. It\u2019s easier said than done. Many of us can\u2019t even decide in a group what to eat. We have limited testing kits daily too. My friends were rejected when they volunteer to be tested. For all you know, we might all be carriers. And the govt chose to care and give to the FWs instead,  who majority are healthy!\n\nRegarding the apology, I felt it should be voluntary and comes from the heart. No point having an insincere one. Maybe the NMP felt injustice towards FW, maybe the MP felt the NMP just wanna exercise power etc. Communication needs to be clarified here between them both. So if the direct party (FWs) demanded an apology, I\u2019m sure the govt might give. So again, it\u2019s a 3rd party (NMP) asking, and the MP might feel NMP has a wrong intention. Idk. \nFor the govt, they are helping as many ways as they can already and that\u2019s their way of showing love (acts of svc). For the NMP it might be words. The way we are governed made us very practical growing up. Govt give money, we say not enough. We sing songs, people say we hypocrite. People can never be fully pleased.\n\nSo I do agree with what you said. And I appreciate it. The govt had to make a decision, between WHO or doctors/watch groups. It\u2019s not easy.",

This are not Malaysian foreign workers building a new drain in KL or Indonesian foreign workers paving a road in Jakarta. These are people who are by proxy of an construction agency, living and working for the needs of Singaporeans. They live on our land, they work on our streets, they spend their salary on food and amenities bought in our country, the only thing that distinguishes these people from our labourers is a pink coloured identification card. To excuse the mistreatment of people who live and work in the name of our country on the basis of a classification you are born into is indicative of an ungrateful society that prides itself on the exclusivity of having birth coordinates located on these 721km^2 of land. A number that is a human construct being used to justify an inhumane predisposition of people that were not fortunate enough to be graced with an upbringing on this island yet have worked twice as hard to earn their place here is disgusting and disgraceful. For all the civics and morals lessons spent on the youth throughout their years in school to be wasted on the inability to value basic human empathy over a few pocketed dollars you never see in the end.",

Because employers are \"expected\" to do so, suddenly their living areas all clean and not oversaturated with people? What if employers fail their \"expectations\"?

According to MOM\u2019s website it is the responsibility of employers to Ensure that the foreign workers live in proper working conditions (https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing). Which means, even in dormitories or housing estates, they are to enforce proper living standards (eg no exceeding of limit of FW per unit - https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing ) I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re coming in talking about cheap housing when literally no one is talking about the expenses of housing them or even hiring them?

Employers are EXPECTED to uphold the integrity of them and to ensure adequate living and working conditions. Yes, the government (and everyone) could do better to Ensure that, but did you really care about this community before all these? Can you actively say that YOU have done your part to ensure they never faced all these discrimination and lack of proper care? If you have, then thank you, we do need more people like you. That being said, since you\u2019re apparently very passionate about each and every foreign workers living conditions, i suggest you seek an employment along this line or continue to proactively aid our foreign workers so your words aren\u2019t just empty bull.

If employers fail their expectations, then it is expected that the relevant authorities do something about it and report to the higher ups whenever necessary, and would be better if they proceeded with follow ups to ensure that standards are being enforced. Since you brought up that point, do you have any other suggestion as to how to avoid future problems from arising? Because I think we can really use them. I brought up the point of asking if you have done something meaningful for the migrant workers in the past because, as you can see, there are plentiful of keyboard warriors ready to point fingers and blame the government when they never cared about our FW and are just jumping on the bandwagon simply for the fun of it. Constructive criticism is obviously appreciated, but when it becomes unnecessary noice and negative comments with no help whatsoever, is it really needed? If the same trolls actually put in the same amount of effort to bring attention to these FW\u2019s plight from the beginning, would their situation be as bad as it is? My point of my original comment wasn\u2019t to shame the government or any individual. It was to be the voice of reason to people who were demanding unreasonable and unfeasible actions.

Idk if you understand this but they don't come from countries where emphasis is placed on hygiene AND putting many workers in 1 dorm will worsen the conditions even if they put in effort which I'm sure they maintain personal hygiene but sometimes environmental hygiene is not something we can control. What if there's ants infestation because of the dorm location? Huh? Then what? You want them to buy chemicals to clean ? These are people who work long shifts to send money back home, not pampered children who take things for granted. Shame on you.

The govt plays the ball game very well, just like a matrix. It leads to a point where there's no clear and win win solution for everyone. So in terms of not providing proper living conditions for the foreign workers, I can't blame the employers fully. The levy expensive already and still need to pay for a better living condition?

The problem is twofold, stemming from systemic negligence on both the government\u2019s part as well as the dorm operator\u2019s part. Cleanliness and hygiene is not solely dependent on workers themselves, but rather the facilities, amenities, time available. The limited space per person, toilet ratio, is bound to catalyse the spread of outbreak- if u can\u2019t understand this concept, u can check it on WHO / or 2015 parliament speech by former MOM chief Tan Chuan Jin. The issue has been recognised by parliament, yet nothing Has been done, not even an Apology? If u can\u2019t convince others by facts, u don\u2019t have to stoop so Low and resort to vulgarities. At least be civic minded and not be such a terrible influence to your kid(hope u don\u2019t). Forcing employers to get a shelter for the workers is BASIC decency- all around first world country, this is the most decent act to be done. However, it is done to a SUB PAR standard, why are u condoning the government\u2019s negligence? Do u think the migrant workers don\u2019t deserve at least a sufficient space with amenities? Are u saying, u understand \u201chow it works\u201d which means long term negligence and profiting off the workers through a capitalist structure- and u have the audacity to claim the moral high ground? Get your facts CHECKED and don\u2019t be an empty vessel",

We rent the whole place for them where max capacity was capped at 8 pax for each private housing, regardless of size. So I can have a 4 storey bungalow but I could only house 8 pax. Subsequently, govt decided to reduce max capacity to 6 pax in 1 location regardless of land size.\n\nthen it becomes very ex to pay for such rental because the rental per pax goes up by a significant amount. so we\u2019ve got no choice but to move to purpose-built/ mom approved dorms (which i believe is a move by the govt to make ppl move to purpose built dorms). to be fair, when regulations were less stringent in the past, there were also a lot of stories where workers are cramped into places and its just not sanitary etc. old regulations states 8 ppl in a private property. some ppl idk what they do they house 10, 20, 30 pax god knows. as long as MOM dont come checking or nth major happens like some fire or disease, nobody knows. \nbut cuz of these black sheep, our workers suffer. cuz when we rent a place for them, and mom says 8 pax, we only put 8 pax in 1 location. we dont want trouble with MOM so we are very compliant. so moving into a purpose built dorm is a nightmare for our workers.",

We care for their surroundings, their living conditions, their health and welfare. Let me bring about the differences in living in private housing vs the purpose-built dorms. What is different is as mentioned above, the dorm operators charge other fees on top of just rental. They made it compulsory for us to pay for laundry. My workers feedback that their clothes are not thoroughly washed, and told us not to waste money on such charges. However we can\u2019t opt out and have to pay anyway. We also do pay conservancy and utilities. These are part of the services that the dorm operators should provide. I wish we knew of their living conditions sooner than later, but the fact is that we are not aware. My own workers have not mentioned anything, probably because their previous dorm has bed bug issues and we have already resolved that by terminating the contract early to move them out, I have no idea. Also we can\u2019t just move in and out of their dorms freely to do checks etc, this is not our duty but duty of the dorm operators. \nIt\u2019s not like we set the standards of these dormitories - We have no say. Govt alr pushed many of us to go for purpose-built dorms such as s11, as they reduce the max capacity in private housing for our fw. I can\u2019t say the same for all other companies but I can safely say our company is very nice to our workers. From time to time we buy them food, fruits, beer. we give them clothing. The public likes to talk about employers being mean to our FW, paying for cheap labour etc. On the contrary, we also have morals and empathy. We treat our workers fairly.",
