TikToks? High intensity workouts at home? Tosh Rock ( @toshrock ) shares what he has been up to during this Circuit Breaker period and tries to rap with a mouth full of berries.

Mothership Offline is a brand new series where we mail out handwritten questions curated from our YouTube community to a list of celebrities and tastemakers. They will be answering them in the comfort of their own home (because stay at home!) and sharing things you can try at home during this CB period.
