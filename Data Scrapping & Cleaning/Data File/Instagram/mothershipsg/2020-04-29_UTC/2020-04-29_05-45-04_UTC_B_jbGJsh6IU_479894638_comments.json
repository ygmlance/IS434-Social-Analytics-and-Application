In no way were we \u201cbashing\u201d up Japan. We merely stated our observations, with data and articles. It is your subjective view that we portrayed Japan as \u201cbad\u201d but in truth it is just what is observed. The \u201cpositive\u201d things we said about Japan was left out but nevertheless this does not make it a Japan \u201cbashing\u201d video. If you think there is a problem, refer to my point 1. 3.

I am frustrated at a slew of media outlets which seem to take particular aim at Japan and I am simply baffled at the fascination with how this country is dealing with COVID19 when they should really be looking at their own backyards.

                "text": "@ckmcflurry Hey there, thanks for your reply. I'm surprised someone from the video would comment. I understand that the entire interview can't be squeezed into a video unless it's like a Joe Rogan or London Real interview/podcast. I'd love to share my views but texting on instagram will not be able to justify all of them. Nevertheless, I'm glad to hear that you guys shared positive views. So my next question would then be why they weren't included in the final video. With the current state, people need to be empowered by positivity, not bring each other down. We learn from each other. The way this video is put together, it feels very biased towards Singapore, trying to tell Singaporeans to be appreciative of what the government is doing. With that said, I AM appreciative of what the govt has done for us but comparing other countries' policies with ours is not very fair as a lot of factors are not taken into account. And this is not just coming from me but Japanese friends as well. With the whole panic buy thing, it's not happening all over Japan. What was shown was probably in city areas where it's saturated with people, both local and foreigners. I can go on more about the other content shared within this video but it'll never end if I keep going on text. Mothership has chosen to show a certain narrative with this video. And in my opinion, it's not an objective one. It misleads Singaporeans who trust this platform and trust the people who are actually living in Japan. Fear is a deadlier virus. And the news and media are feeding it excessively. FYI, this is definitely not an attack on you or any of the people in the video. I question the producer of this video, their intent on choosing what segments to showcase, etc. In any case, I hope you guys are staying safe and healthy as well :)",
