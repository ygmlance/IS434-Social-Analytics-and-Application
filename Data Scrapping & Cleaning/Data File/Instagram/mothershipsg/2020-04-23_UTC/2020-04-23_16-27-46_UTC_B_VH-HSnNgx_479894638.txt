Preliminary investigations revealed that the woman, who is a civil servant and an authorised recipient of classified information on Covid-19, had shared the number of new cases in Singapore for the day with members in a private WeChat group.

This happened on several occasions.

Members in the WeChat group, who were not authorised to receive the classified information, further disseminated it before MOH officially released the information.
